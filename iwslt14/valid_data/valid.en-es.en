and that flow , that flow of life , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that ecologists see .
now , a dolphin , mother dolphin , any dolphin -- there &apos;s only one way that a pcb can get out of a dolphin .
it turns out that a lot of dolphins are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world .
how many people have seen a &quot; beach closed &quot; sign ?
that has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn &apos;t move these vectors of cholera around the world .
well , i want to leave you with the thought that what we &apos;re really trying to do here is protect this ocean pyramid , and that ocean pyramid connects to our own pyramid of life .
bj : so every moment it &apos;s on the stage , it &apos;s making the struggle .
the horse is sold to the first world war , and he joins up to find his horse .
ak : a month later , we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .
joey , come here .
ak : you want to say something about the breathing ?
and now just -- all the way from sunny california we have zem joaquin who &apos;s going to ride the horse for us .
we evolved as a species near the equator , and so we &apos;re very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness .
when philanthropy was reinvented a century ago , when the foundation form was actually invented , they didn &apos;t think of themselves on the wrong side of these either .
the book is called &quot; blessed unrest . &quot;
and understand how they help us re-perceive what organized philanthropy is .
whatever we call it , it &apos;s new , it &apos;s beginning , and i think it &apos;s gong to quite significant .
and i want you to imagine that it &apos;s 100 years from now , and your grandchild , or great-grandchild , or niece or nephew or god-child , is looking at this photograph of you .
i mean , i &apos;ve been a bit disappointed sometimes when i saw this data and all this deployment , just for five people .
and this is exactly what we &apos;ve been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and texting under the table to their friends .
when people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work .
behind issues of security and safety , which have always been the arguments for social control , in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who , in fact , has a right to self determine their attention , to decide , whether they should , or not , be isolated .
you see , i have a passion for racing .
however , neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this .
not a challenging task .
we know that two-thirds of them are going to go back .
her family has eight generations in a town called whitesville , west virginia .
yeah .
fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years , the city wanted to build a jail .
and we all need to be invested in it .
and sometimes i would loan him money from my after-school or summer jobs , and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest , of course , after he hit it big .
so i want everyone to understand the critical importance of shifting charity into enterprise .
when i was little , my mother used to say , &quot; the love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world .
and i suddenly thought , most deaf children are born to hearing parents .
love is something that ideally is there unconditionally throughout the relationship between a parent and a child .
i &apos;m going to quote from another magazine of the &apos; 60s .
and yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before .
i &apos;d want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing . &quot;
and so she and i have a daughter , and mother and daughter live in texas .
i think children had ensnared me the moment i connected fatherhood with loss .
i studied architecture , then did a second degree in architecture , and then actually quickly realized that it wasn &apos;t architecture .
and when people tell me , &quot; who &apos;s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? &quot;
we &apos;ve got money in the bank . it &apos;s because you get the best people .
the most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product .
and this is the big difference .
the president of rwanda stepped in and said he would do it .
i just want to end with one last one . this one is not even 24-hours old , or maybe it &apos;s 24-hours .
but i can offer some natural light and year-round climate control .
so for do-it-yourselfers , we provide free , very well-tested instructions so that anyone , anywhere around the world , can build one of these systems for free .
i think we &apos;re sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common , and i think we &apos;re sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years , where the first few robots are starting to appear .
see , the three-year-old kids , they don &apos;t worry about it .
nick robertson has that story .
i &apos;d looked at his eyes , and i saw his eyes looked at this bottle top .
and so these weights change .
these are naive subjects .
ritchie : yeah , look , it &apos;s got a little blue light in it too . i almost lost it this week .
recently we &apos;ve been battered with the idea that maybe we didn &apos;t even have our own creation event , here on earth , which people didn &apos;t like much . and then the human genome said , maybe we only have 35,000 genes . and that was really -- people didn &apos;t like that , we &apos;ve got more genes than that .
the most famous early battle was alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson over what the dollar would be and how it would be backed up , with alexander hamilton saying , &quot; we need a central bank , the first bank of the united states , or else the dollar will have no value .
the republicans say , hey , no , no , we &apos;ve got a better idea .
they even like medicaid , even though that goes to the poor and indigent , which you might think would have less support .
this brings up a really important point , which is that we tend in this country to talk about democrats and republicans and think there &apos;s this little group over there called independents that &apos;s , what , two percent ?
i &apos;ve spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major organizations that survey american political attitudes : pew research , the university of chicago &apos;s national opinion research center , and the most important but the least known is the american national election studies group that is the world &apos;s longest , most respected poll of political attitudes .
and nothing happened at all .
you probably think , well , i don &apos;t know which one you think it is , but i think it &apos;s about feeling beauty .
i felt a sense of relaxation tempered with anticipation .
would you mind taking the brain out , and i just want you to feel something .
and by the way , there &apos;s no pleasure in that face .
and one of the most tedious ones , i think , was saying that beauty was about symmetry .
this bit , the big secret of automotive design -- reflection management .
did you see what i did ?
you all , i guess , like me , enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance .
you may see 50 , 100 , 200 things on a shelf as you walk down it , but i have to work within that domain , to ensure that it gets you there first .
a story , a work of art , a face , a designed object -- how do we tell that something is beautiful ? and why does it matter so much to us ? designer richard seymour explores our response to beauty and the surprising power of objects that exhibit it .
i think there is an alternative .
and that &apos;s a very plausible idea .
that &apos;s what all religions tell us : &quot; get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day . &quot;
we should all look at the moon a bit more often . we don &apos;t .
so in orthodox jewish communities , every friday you go to a mikveh .
essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
they &apos;re collaborative , they &apos;re branded , they &apos;re multinational , and they &apos;re highly disciplined .
you can get shot by both sides .
no , we need to be polite about differences .
that feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career -- from being a software engineer to become a science writer -- so that i could partake in the joy of science , and also the joy of communicating it to others .
you need something like tens of megatons of water -- almost a gigaton of water -- in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino .
the toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack .
so this is us landing on the ross ice shelf in antarctica .
the fabric alone weighs two tons .
if we don &apos;t do that , we &apos;re going to get the generation we deserve .
it is , by far and away , the largest print library in the world .
it costs about three dollars to download , print and bind a normal , old book .
and it &apos;s called the &quot; espresso book machine , &quot; and in about 10 minutes , you can press a button and make a book .
if it &apos;s basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize , ocr , package it up , make it so that you could download , print and bind it -- the whole shebang -- we would have achieved something .
we &apos;ve scanned about 200,000 books .
in the united states , it doesn &apos;t cost you to give something away . right ?
it &apos;s about a petabyte , so far , of worldwide television -- russian , chinese , japanese , iraqi , al jazeera , bbc , cnn , abc , cbs , nbc -- 24 hours a day .
so we &apos;ve started to -- we &apos;ve made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the library of alexandria .
adoration and admiration will overwhelm you .
and this , and then this .
so , i hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group .
and in these cavities , these micro-cavities form , and as they fuse soils , they absorb water .
this was first discovered in 1859 .
i &apos;m going to show you six , if i can , solutions for helping to save the world .
in 48 hours to 72 hours , these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times .
here &apos;s the selectivity index numbers -- against pox , you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses , compared to the ribavirin controls , we have an extraordinarily high activity .
i then received my second patent -- and this is a big one .
generating ethanol from cellulose using mycelium as an intermediary -- and you gain all the benefits that i &apos;ve described to you already .
back then , yes , i guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the earth , right ?
it was essentially an organic farm .
and we had sleep apnea at night .
and nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that .
we had one on the shuttle and one on the international space station , for 16 months , where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space -- really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are .
when i &apos;m modeling a plant in a box , literally , i know where to draw the boundary .
and i let all of the leaves fall from the trees that i have on my property .
jane poynter : life in biosphere 2
if you had an acute congestive heart failure , they could bleed a pint of blood from you by opening up an arm vein , giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis and then giving you oxygen by tent .
that is to say , it took basically the nursing time and then just a little bit of time for a doctor who more or less checked in on you once a day .
having great components is not enough , and yet we &apos;ve been obsessed in medicine with components .
skill one , find where your failures are .
instead , you can make a recipe for how to have a team that &apos;s prepared for the unexpected .
and we &apos;ve come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize , as individualistic as we want to be , complexity requires group success .
we think perhaps it &apos;s a combination of factors .
i mean , there may be 100 explanations for why haiti is the impoverished nation it is , but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor .
and so , it &apos;s a very dynamic , and i think , historic and exciting community to be involved with .
we have bumblebees on the top .
and that is , make meadows and not lawns .
and if we want to cure ourselves of ndd , or nature deficit disorder , i think this is a great way of doing it .
and i just couldn &apos;t .
okay , i &apos;m not the only one whistling here .
max westerman : geert chatrou , the world champion &#91; of &#93; whistling .
this is quite comforting for people like me -- i &apos;m a professor -- this to be over there on the top of creation .
but plants are also able to show a lot of movement .
this is a serious business .
now let &apos;s imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others .
well , thank you for your attention .
they &apos;re going to be entering this car one by one .
this january , we did the 10th annual no pants subway ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in new york -- almost every single train line in the city .
so that particular event was inspired by a moment that i happened to stumble upon .
that &apos;s a cop wearing black right there , being filmed with a hidden camera .
the participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers , they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .
countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines -- a simple and invaluable way for miners to know whether they &apos;re safe .
no , no .
because what i &apos;ve been doing for the last four years , really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion , and in the last four years i &apos;ve been working just about non-stop on this topic .
informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy .
back to the cow .
leslie orgel is still a molecular biologist , brilliant guy , and orgel &apos;s second rule is : evolution is cleverer than you are .
that is what we have done on this planet .
there &apos;s all sorts of wonderful cases of species .
and what i want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint , because i think it &apos;s actually a brilliant book .
the book is clear , vivid , accessible , beautifully formatted .
we don &apos;t need a belief in god to be good or to have meaning in us .
your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second . &quot;
and i &apos;d really like to get a response if rick is able to do it .
incidentally , we see just one octave .
noise kills 200,000 people a year in europe .
now that &apos;s a really serious problem .
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions .
julian treasure says our increasingly noisy world is gnawing away at our mental health -- even costing lives . he lays out an 8-step plan to soften this sonic assault and restore our relationship with sound .
and the creator of this , he said , &quot; this is fire . i call this fire . &quot;
but this is not what &apos;s awesome .
and then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics , but let &apos;s just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over .
and so we needed hundreds of people to buy this .
we didn &apos;t plan for that at all .
i &apos;d like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself , because space can wobble like a drum .
it wasn &apos;t einstein who realized this , it was karl schwarzschild who was a german jew in world war i -- joined the german army already an accomplished scientist , working on the russian front .
we &apos;re talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of manhattan .
so they &apos;re crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second , and as they do so , they not only curve space , but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space , an actual wave on space-time .
no , i &apos;m not showing you any images , because black holes don &apos;t leave behind helpful trails of ink , and space is not painted , showing you the curves .
but lisa could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe &apos;s history , the last 15 minutes before they fall together .
but it &apos;s around us everywhere , presumably , if it hasn &apos;t been wiped out by some other process in the universe .
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year , i simply measured and summed each of those lines .
they &apos;ve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners .
that is our regime , our government -- our atrocious government , &#91; that &#93; has done every crime in order to stay in power .
so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
these are some of the shots actually from my film .
and it &apos;s a great honor to be an iranian woman and an iranian artist , even if i have to operate in the west only for now .
on that self , it should be centered -- a bigness , a wholeness .
it &apos;s experienced by people occasionally .
i have no more reason to blame myself .
you need to .
national assembly : they create the committee of public safety , which sounds like a very nice committee .
and that &apos;s what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before , and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room .
and then a few other things started to dawn on me .
but the paradigm here is , we &apos;ll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept , until you get 10 in a row .
this is just another one of the modules .
this is the blocking and tackling , making sure you know how to move through a system of equations , and it frees up time for the simulations , for the games , for the mechanics , for the robot building , for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow .
so when you talk about self-paced learning , it makes sense for everyone -- in education-speak , differentiated learning -- but it &apos;s kind of crazy when you see it in a classroom .
and i think what you &apos;ll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom .
it &apos;s not an only-in-school thing .
well , it &apos;s amazing .
animals too .
and she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
you don &apos;t have to be completely blind , only sufficiently impaired .
but when he got back home , he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high , on his study table .
but what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie , the faces were often deformed , with very large teeth or very large eyes .
and one of the second commonest is cartoons .
it &apos;s only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion .
you speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients .
i also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution .
there &apos;s a lot of animals that use this trick , for example this black dragonfish .
and some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in &quot; avatar , &quot; but you don &apos;t have to travel to pandora to see them .
it &apos;s got a brittle star hitching a ride .
we basically have a chat room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody &apos;s talking .
he &apos;s thinking about it .
they draw pictures of what they &apos;re observing with their eyes , through technology like telescopes and microscopes , and also what they &apos;re thinking about in their minds .
those are the letters of genetic code , the 25,000 genes you &apos;ve got written in your dna .
and we &apos;ll come back to chromosomes in a minute .
they &apos;re called mircrotubules . that name &apos;s not important .
the problem is we can &apos;t show it to you any other way .
keep your eyes lifted and your head turning .
i found out that in science and all its applications , what is crucial is not that technical ability , but it is imagination in all of its applications .
make a fray of your own .
all of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science behind it you will master .
again , we can &apos;t know , but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved .
neither one wants to be the first one or they &apos;re going to get the sucker &apos;s payoff , but both lose , of course , because they don &apos;t get what they want .
but there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology , from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology .
bittorrent turns every downloader into an uploader , making the system more efficient the more it is used .
and we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to .
now i just made a transition indoors . that &apos;s also interesting .
i &apos;m going to abandon them now and walk back outside .
and if people were just trying to be happy , the moment they would get to the top , they would say , &quot; this was a terrible mistake .
we &apos;ll pay you three dollars for it . &quot;
now what happens when you compare these two conditions ?
we basically eliminated it .
but if you understood how important meaning is , then you would figure out that it &apos;s actually important to spend some time , energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they &apos;re doing .
so maybe the first sheet you would do good work , but then you see nobody is really testing it , so you would do more and more and more .
and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that .
and what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami , and they were willing to pay for them five times more than the people who just evaluated them externally .
most people would say for a lot , a lot of money -- on good days .
is efficiency still more important than meaning ?
they were young soldiers , typically child soldiers .
and there they had a detention camp where alleged vietnamese would be tested , language tested .
jung in afghanistan -- you get the picture .
to compensate this loss of inner control , they try to control the outside , very understandably -- mostly the family -- and unfortunately , this fits very well into the traditional side , regressive side , repressive side , restrictive side of the cultural context .
this was our sign -- it &apos;s hand-painted , and we had 45 all over kabul .
and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future . &quot;
transport , we don &apos;t need oil anymore . &quot;
so , that &apos;s the u.k. , and the population density of the u.k .
so &apos;s germany , and japan is consuming a bit more .
of course , britain doesn &apos;t have any deserts .
first , transport . here are the physics principles that tell you how to reduce the energy consumption of transport , and people often say , &quot; oh , yes , technology can answer everything .
the third demand side option i want to talk about , the third way to reduce energy consumption is , read your meters .
since i was a boy , in my early childhood , i always wanted to be a musician , and , thank god , i made it .
with his effort , and the support of his mother , his family and his community , he became a principal member in the double bass segment of the berlin philharmonic orchestra .
the spontaneity music has excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society .
again , i will go through them as fast as possible .
and then when you finally see where it is , then you &apos;ve got to move it to get the cursor over there , and then -- &quot; bang &quot; -- you &apos;ve got to hit a button or do whatever .
but imagine that screen having lots of objects on it and the person has touched an object -- one of n -- like he did there , and then pushed on it .
and then for a real beginner , you would go down even further and elaborate more -- say , &quot; open the oven , preheat , wait for the light to go out , open the door , don &apos;t leave it open too long , put the penguin in and shut the door ... &quot; whatever .
repairman : ... not too far out . front poles , preferably .
the child read beautifully , it turned out , and was really very competent . so it actually meant something .
and the fact that we knew the people -- we had to take a page out of the history of walt disney -- we actually went so far as to build crts in the shapes of the people &apos;s faces .
because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it .
so , these are what i would call behavioral markers .
it &apos;s like the lights are on , but nobody &apos;s home on this demographic y2k + 10 problem . right ?
now , i &apos;m not anti-hospital .
how do we get a personal baseline about what &apos;s going to work for you ?
it &apos;s a research platform .
i &apos;m not bragging about how much we fund ; it &apos;s how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging , chronic disease management and independent living in the home .
i &apos;m going to be showing some of the cybercriminals &apos; latest and nastiest creations .
if you want your business competitors to go down , well , they can .
well , you could try looking really cute .
so let &apos;s imagine that our attacker , called evil hacker just for comedy value , inserts something a little nasty .
that &apos;s a username , kind of like you might have on twitter .
this is mobsoft , one of the companies that this cybercriminal gang owned , and an interesting thing about mobsoft is the 50-percent owner of this posted a job advert , and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers from the code earlier .
let &apos;s talk about you .
so my ask is this : go online , find these simple best practices , find out how to update and patch your computer .
and so , at that time , i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues .
then the dinosaurs , being social , act out their socialness , and they get together , and they conspire .
we don &apos;t really know how long dinosaurs lived , because we haven &apos;t found the oldest one yet .
but it &apos;s not dinosaur dna .
we &apos;ll call them biological modification tools .
this is a chicken with teeth .
but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail , gets rid of it .
this was great . my pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork . i sold that pork to my school friends &apos; parents , and i made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance .
a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs .
strange you might think , but if we could rely on corporations to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores , we wouldn &apos;t need to go sneaking around the back , opening up bins and having a look at what &apos;s inside .
a chef came to talk to me , i finished my bowl , and halfway through the conversation , he stopped talking and he started frowning into my bowl .
at the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them .
as you can see , these are all maps .
i mean kids are studying this stuff and they &apos;ve got the word &quot; fluctus &quot; up there . that &apos;s wrong .
and you know they &apos;re international because they put it &quot; en francais &quot; as well .
is that mars ya marov ?
he was also famous for having no body .
and judging from this , it looks a little like a cheeseburger .
when did this happen ?
look , ours is more red , it &apos;s longer .
i can just divide numbers , that &apos;s like atom smashing .
look at that ! i mean you cannot make that stuff up .
i never told anybody . this is the first thing . this could be history .
so the basic idea of i.p. , or internet protocol , and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it , were fundamentally &quot; from each according to their ability , to each according to their need . &quot;
what they &apos;ll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the iranian nuclear facility .
that &apos;s crazy . it was never designed to do things like that .
danny hillis : the internet could crash . we need a plan b
which was indeed the case in europe between 1650 and 1750 .
this is the environment that &apos;s being created by cyber weapons today , and historically it was the environment in europe at the onset of world war i .
eventually , my mom took the red crayon away , so it was &#91; unclear &#93; .
whenever i talk to kids , i always like to tell them , the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive .
it &apos;s not an animal we draw cartoons of or draw at all .
he &apos;s sort of a homer simpson with fins .
and i told him , &quot; well , i need something a little sexier than that .
ostensibly , he &apos;s dead now .
and you take the piece out into the daylight .
it &apos;s a land known to the tahltan people and all the first nations of british columbia as the sacred headwaters , the source of the three great salmon rivers of home , the skeena , the stikine and the nass .
men , women and children of all ages , elders in wheelchairs , have blockaded the only road access to the interior .
audience : 22 .
93 squared . would you call out your answers , please ?
321 is 103,041 . 103,041 .
does yours go higher ?
ok , any six of them .
call -- call -- what year was it ?
and what month ? june .
i &apos;ll do 57,000 squared , plus 683 squared , plus 57,000 times 683 times two .
good .
so don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
right away , i hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
this guy over here of course is me .
i was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
i &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
those of you who are physicists , i hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me .
this cop comes after me with a rifle .
i &apos;m asking myself , &quot; why am i here ? &quot;
i wanted it all -- home office , sit down dinner for 10 , room for guests , and all my kite surfing gear .
in the winning life edited scheme in a render here , we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space .
it &apos;s got to be serious if the new york times puts a cover story of their february 17th sunday magazine about play .
they &apos;re in a state of play .
it doesn &apos;t have a particular purpose , and that &apos;s what &apos;s great about play .
preschool kids , for example , should be allowed to dive , hit , whistle , scream , be chaotic , and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive , emotional and physical -- that come as a part of rough and tumble play .
i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t have a playful-looking subject , but it allows mobility , which has limited the actual study of play .
and you can trust it .
he had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington , d.c .
the wearable meeting .
so people know that it &apos;s there .
the difference between our nachos and the other guy &apos;s nachos , is that this is actually a dessert .
so after we do that , we put it into a vacuum bag , add a little bit of seaweed , some spices , and we roll it , and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna .
this map -- -- this map shows the number of seconds that american network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories , by country , in february of 2007 -- just one year ago .
and if you think it &apos;s simply because we are not interested , you would be wrong .
and the thing i &apos;m really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences .
and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically , a relative mapping between curvature and shape .
you know ? they don &apos;t imagine the person in the booth , typing it all .
so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them .
that &apos;s why its other name is doubletaker , taker of doubles .
in fact , this is not unique to hiv . the vast majority of viruses come from animals .
patrice and patee have been out for hours but found nothing .
ok , take a look at his shirt .
ubald laughs at me when i show this photo because of course you can &apos;t see his face .
it &apos;s also working in live animal markets -- these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where sars emerged in asia .
so , for instance , i may twitter right now that i &apos;m giving a talk at ted .
we built an application-programming interface , which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with twitter .
so we &apos;re going to just type a couple of random words into twitter .
and for many years afterwards , i would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer .
i was startled .
after referring to the black africans as &quot; beasts who have no houses , &quot; he writes , &quot; they are also people without heads , having their mouth and eyes in their breasts . &quot;
like our economic and political worlds , stories too are defined by the principle of nkali : how they are told , who tells them , when they &apos;re told , how many stories are told , are really dependent on power .
they make one story become the only story .
what if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider , who has just started her own business selling hair extensions ?
because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity , we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can -- that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own .
you see , we also learn that experts are located , are governed , by the social and cultural norms of their times -- whether it be the doctors in victorian england , say , who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire , or the psychiatrists in the united states who , up until 1973 , were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness .
and women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don &apos;t work nearly as well on women as they do on men -- and the drugs that do work well work so well that they &apos;re actively harmful for women to take .
noreena hertz : how to use experts -- and when not to
let &apos;s start with the hobbies . when you get dementia , it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself .
so i &apos;m doing activities that will build my sense of balance .
about six months later i figured out it must be hydrogen , until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth , which is , you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car , if you use hydrogen .
now it sounds crazy . but in some places around the world , like scandinavia , you already have that .
you have the crude oil .
so in a sense this is an absolute zero-carbon , zero-fossil fuel electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020 .
we went to other countries . as i said we went to denmark .
and the most fascinating thing we &apos;ve learned is that , when you have small problems on the individual level , like the price of gasoline to drive every morning .
right ? remember in the campaign : one million hybrid cars by 2015 .
they basically looked at it and said , &quot; car 1.0 we &apos;ll solve everything within the car itself . &quot;
one car emits four tons .
forget about the hybrid auto -- shai agassi says it &apos;s electric cars or bust if we want to impact emissions . his company , better place , has a radical plan to take entire countries oil-free by 2020 .
this book , &quot; finding darwin &apos;s god , &quot; by kenneth miller , is one of the most effective attacks on intelligent design that i know , and it &apos;s all the more effective because it &apos;s written by a devout christian .
it has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge .
now , the next one , &quot; the president of the royal society has been vouchsafed a strong inner conviction &quot; -- -- &quot; ... that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
she clearly feels in a beleaguered minority , but actually , how do american atheists stack up numerically ?
so , we &apos;ve reached a truly remarkable situation , a grotesque mismatch between the american intelligentsia and the american electorate .
it &apos;s a sort of urban myth , that marx tried to dedicate &quot; kapital &quot; to darwin .
my problem with it only is its apparent anthropocentrism .
if my books sold as well as stephen hawking &apos;s books , instead of only as well as richard dawkins &apos; books , i &apos;d do it myself .
they &apos;re not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network .
and again , here , you see barbie.com , but also , very quickly , adiosbarbie.com , the body image for every size . a contested cultural object , which you won &apos;t find anywhere soon on overture , which is the classic market-based mechanism : whoever pays the most is highest on the list .
instead , what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market : information flows to decide what are interesting problems ; who &apos;s available and good for something ; motivation structures -- remember , money isn &apos;t always the best motivator .
that &apos;s what ibm does in software services , and they &apos;ve done reasonably well .
on 15th of september 2005 , mr. diepreye alamieyeseigha , a governor of one of the oil-rich states of nigeria , was arrested by the london metropolitan police on a visit to london .
i &apos;m working on an initiative now , along with the world bank , on asset recovery , trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad -- developing countries &apos; moneys -- to get that sent back .
when president obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector , we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million gsm lines , and counting .
our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy .
and that &apos;s what many people know east africa for : the wildlife , the elephants , and so on .
understand that the woman who made it is going to be in tanzania , where they &apos;re having the session in june .
he looked at the odds of another world war , of a massive volcanic eruption , even of an asteroid hitting the earth .
until recently , we haven &apos;t had to know exactly how a vaccine worked .
the principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they &apos;re always changing .
these drugs aren &apos;t cures , but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of hiv , at least for those who can access them .
but , you know , the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .
it was a slow , cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs , millions of living chicken eggs .
so here &apos;s a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies .
so , if we can figure out how to do that , then we have the vaccine , and what &apos;s interesting is there already is some evidence that we &apos;re beginning to crack that problem .
so what &apos;s really going on ? well , villages of the world are emptying out .
this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century .
helping africa is noble .
the next chapter begins with first of all , asking ourselves this fundamental question , &quot; whom do we want to help in africa ? &quot;
where do they get their money ?
and you can &apos;t develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work .
they own farms . they decide what to do , what to produce .
yes , it &apos;s an enterprise .
it meant a connection to the world .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan .
because i think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being .
she took our order , and then went to the couple in the booth next to us , and she lowered her voice so much i had to really strain to hear what she was saying .
i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it .
those of you who are good at branding , i &apos;d love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people .
once it becomes a closed system , with u.s. participation , then everybody who &apos;s on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation ?
now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on , that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it .
you see a lot of oil on the shoreline .
these are the things that you can see .
a writer named ted williams called me , and he was asking me a couple of questions about what i saw , because he &apos;s writing an article for audubon magazine .
they don &apos;t usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway .
the booms are absolutely not made for open water .
i think that &apos;s the most important thing that people have , is compassion .
you can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of america , and even thomas jefferson complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country .
energy is always a moral issue .
i developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that homeland security has .
what do you guys think ?
that &apos;s a lot of information .
and we keep on doing that , slice after slice .
just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate , one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches .
at the present time , my collaborators and i , what we &apos;re aiming for is much more modest -- just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain .
do not forget that groove in the earth called the stream bed .
and if that were successful , that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome .
the question is : has that damage erased the connectome ?
zk : now , it &apos;s important to understand what the unexpected properties are .
zk : so now , when we dream up these concepts , it &apos;s important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint .
an olive server .
zk : wait , wait , steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends .
now , to think about the potential for this , think of all the places ink is supplied : on business cards , on the back of cereal boxes , board games . any place you use ink , you could change the way you interact with it .
by detecting the odor of particular bacteria , or viruses , or even lung cancer , the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results .
really , it happened here in san francisco to a famous chef .
his great-granddad started -- patería de sousa -- in 1812 .
as funny as it sounds , articulating it now and reading about it -- actually , if we had talked about it before this controversy , i would have said , &quot; that &apos;s kind of true . &quot;
and fence line was amazing in itself .
and they are allowed to take whatever they want .
of the highest quality foie gras yellow i &apos;ve ever seen .
they &apos;ve come to stay . &quot;
so much so that i don &apos;t think i had ever really had foie gras until that moment .
and it may be because of the wine , or it may be because of my excitement , he answered me directly and he said , &quot; because chefs don &apos;t deserve my foie gras . &quot;
by accident .
it &apos;s an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology .
dan barber : a foie gras parable
so very efficient vehicles , buildings and factories save oil and coal , and also natural gas that can displace both of them .
indeed , that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper .
they are all-american , carbon-free and inexhaustible .
in fact , three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil , not in supply , but in demand .
half of that runs pumps and fans .
that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year -- a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year .
they think they need that ; how about the rest of us that they &apos;re defending ?
but as edgar woolard , who used to chair dupont , reminds us , &quot; companies hampered by old thinking won &apos;t be a problem because , &quot; he said , &quot; they simply won &apos;t be around long-term . &quot;
my initial work focused on uganda , where i focused on negotiating reforms with the finance ministry of uganda so they could access our loans .
and this leads me to the third , and in my view , the most significant shift in development : open governance . governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability .
he fought till the end , increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty , not only did government officials need to be honest , but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard .
that doesn &apos;t interest me .
voice offstage : four point five .
for the end , for the eternity , it is one with a red jacket . &quot;
ptolemy , eratosthenes , einstein , things like that .
and it &apos;s very important to know where we are .
this scenario , of this civilization , was about becoming powerful , intelligent , like this idea we have invented , this concept of god .
you &apos;ll noticed that almost all of them are minority .
and i let them go for about 10 seconds , then i go , &quot; at ease ! &quot;
and you know what , they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant .
and that &apos;s what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school .
now the authorities at ccny were getting tired of me being there .
and i also had this extended network .
we have to make sure they &apos;re ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours , a country that is like no other , a country that amazes me every single day , a country that &apos;s fractious . we &apos;re always arguing with each other .
&quot; yes , yes . &quot; &quot; oh ... &quot; i hand him the money .
first of all , they can give employees and customers more control .
it does not tell the traveler where she &apos;s going until the very last minute , and information is provided just in time . similarly , dutch airline klm launched a surprise campaign , seemingly randomly handing out small gifts to travelers en route to their destination .
if you think of the concept of wikipedia where everyone is collaborating on content , and at the end of the day you &apos;ve built the largest encyclopedia in the world .
there are lots of people who care about their freedom .
&quot; what are we going to do ? &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot;
the leader was everyone on that page .
all the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so-called propaganda , or mainstream media , are proven wrong .
the modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what &apos;s going on up there is nothing short of rocket science .
we &apos;re culture-bound listeners .
we &apos;re arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize .
what you see here is the audio result -- no learning whatsoever -- and the video result -- no learning whatsoever .
patricia kuhl : the linguistic genius of babies
now in los angeles , you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches , but i got mine indoors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re shooting at 3,000 frames per second , you need to have a silly amount of light , lots of lights .
that means it doesn &apos;t mix with the water .
but let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what i just showed you in this live demonstration .
in that hospice , there were 31 men and women who were actively dying .
and that woman did not have sentimental compassion .
and in that paralysis , of course , our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed .
but it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an undefended heart .
joan halifax : compassion and the true meaning of empathy
but you wouldn &apos;t expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together .
well , on the one hand , it &apos;s the sum of the areas of the squares inside it , right ?
so it causes a lot of inner conflict , you know , like part of me likes me , part of me hates me .
and i started freaking out , because i don &apos;t know what kind of crap my grandfather was into .
now i &apos;ll tell you , as a middle eastern male , when you show up around a lot of these activities , you start feeling guilty at one point .
they &apos;re obsessed with having the biggest , tallest , longest , as we all know .
&quot; you take a taxi . you go to zara . make a left . &quot;
so the type of magic i like , and i &apos;m a magician , is a magic that uses technology to create illusions .
we deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses .
that &apos;s &quot; clair de lune . &quot;
however , more often than not , animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they &apos;re treated with a particular drug .
we have three fluidic channels .
mucus traps particulates , viruses , potential allergens , and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out .
we can potentially use the skin on a chip that we &apos;re currently developing in the lab to test whether the ingredients in those products that you &apos;re using are actually safe to put on your skin without the need for animal testing .
it creates an easy user interface .
and i was one of those people .
because they had no idea .
the first one is the state sponsor of terrorism .
it comes back at times of great transformation , globalization being one of those transformations .
no other country can do that .
in europe , a similar legislation was not introduced .
for a long time , i didn &apos;t believe that i could have a big adventure .
but what can you do ? you &apos;re in the middle of the ocean .
and generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter at the other end .
unfortunately , ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line .
so , to make the point , these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash , 15,000 empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons .
and that made me think about how would i feel if britain was going to disappear under the waves ; if the places where i &apos;d been born and gone to school and got married , if all those places were just going to disappear forever .
other people will see if you &apos;re in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag .
five years ago , roz savage quit her high-powered london job to become an ocean rower . she &apos;s crossed the atlantic solo , and just started the third leg of a pacific solo row , the first for a woman . why does she do it ? hear her reasons , both deeply personal and urgently activist .
but it wasn &apos;t until we tested it in people that we actually knew .
so a physicist can &apos;t get access to it without filing paperwork .
so a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust .
right . that &apos;s all a commons is . it &apos;s something that we build together because we think it &apos;s important .
you can start analyzing the data .
you know that all of the cool people are -- they &apos;re doing it .
they &apos;ve made a selection .
we all want to go out and buy an audi tt , don &apos;t we ?
that &apos;s because it &apos;s cheaper .
there are only 16 different pieces of wood , only 16 different assembly parts here .
it &apos;s all about sensuality . it &apos;s all about transforming .
there &apos;s so many of you .
and they said , &quot; don &apos;t be stupid . &quot;
when i was 19 , i wrote , &quot; i will love myself despite the ease with which i lean toward the opposite . &quot;
so we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us , that we &apos;d be lonely forever , that we &apos;d never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their toolshed .
every school was a big top circus tent , and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers , from clowns to carnies , all of these miles ahead of who we were .
ooh baby baby baby baby baby baby yeah .
thanks .
so , loosely defined , that is what &apos;s possible with the human voice .
and the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one .
reggie watts &apos; beats defy boxes . unplug your logic board and watch as he blends poetry and crosses musical genres in this larger-than-life performance .
and the mining and the exploitation of that is creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before .
this is one of the reasons why it &apos;s called the world &apos;s dirtiest oil .
it &apos;s carcinogenic . &quot;
here you see the route down the mackenzie valley .
it compromises the life and the health of some of our most underprivileged and vulnerable people , the aboriginal communities that have so much to teach us .
jitish kallat successfully practices across photography , sculpture , painting and installation .
and finally number 10 , last and certainly not least , ranjani shettar , who lives and works here in the state of karnataka , creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial , and brings , like subodh , the local global .
do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up ? it &apos;s completely static .
al seckel , a cognitive neuroscientist , explores the perceptual illusions that fool our brains . loads of eye tricks help him prove that not only are we easily fooled , we kind of like it .
and the stated goal was to increase popular support for the afghan government .
your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes .
well , we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits .
so i had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms .
but even when i still had the symptoms , even while i was still in pain , i stopped suffering .
i &apos;m better able to focus on my goals and dreams .
i want you to snap your fingers exactly 50 times , or count backwards from 100 by seven , like this : 100 , 93 ...
and this is called the three-to-one positive emotion ratio .
these seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie &apos;s wishes .
the totality of this project involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor -- 99 percent of it done by women .
she thought i &apos;d gone off my head .
this sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century .
i have a straight line on my spherical surface .
what did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this ?
and that &apos;s true . but it also goes deeper than that .
he believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation .
so you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circuitry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
and then what happens is , there &apos;s a blow to your head , damaging the cortex , allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge , flaming to the surface , and suddenly and inexplicably you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother .
you start sweating to dissipate the heat that you &apos;re going to create from muscular exertion .
it &apos;s a lovely example of the sort of thing we do : take a bizarre , seemingly incomprehensible , neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard freudian view is wrong , that , in fact , you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain .
he knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?
he said , &quot; oh , i can &apos;t move my phantom . you know that . it &apos;s painful . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , no , no , you know this phantom i &apos;ve had for the last 10 years ?
he pointed out that certain people in the population , who are otherwise completely normal , had the following peculiarity : every time they see a number , it &apos;s colored .
so , we found that the color area and the number area are right next to each other in the brain , in the fusiform gyrus .
the last demonstration -- can i take one minute ?
sorry about that .
to our knowledge they had no music .
long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them .
these are happy vocalizations .
ss : kanzi &apos;s learned to make stone tools .
they speak when she touches them .
is he looking for where the sound came from ?
because we believe that it &apos;s not biology ; it &apos;s culture .
on a still bigger scale , we see entire galaxies of stars .
but the unfinished business for 21st-century science is to link together cosmos and micro-world with a unified theory -- symbolized , as it were , gastronomically at the top of that picture .
and more than that , it &apos;s engendering new kinds of change .
and i think we have to go back to what happened in the post-war era , post-world war ii , when the nuclear scientists who &apos;d been involved in making the atomic bomb , in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers .
the plaque reads , &quot; albert einstein lived here . &quot;
or will the biosphere stabilize ?
and another person wrote , &quot; i would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne . &quot;
we called them up at night and asked them , &quot; what &apos;d you spend it on , and how happy do you feel now ? &quot;
or in uganda , &quot; name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people and describe that . &quot;
this isn &apos;t $ 10,000 , it &apos;s the local currency .
so almost everywhere we look we see that giving money away makes you happier than keeping it for yourself .
other teams , we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates .
the relations between the iranian and the jewish people throughout history has actually been quite positive , starting in 539 b.c. , when king cyrus the great of persia liberated the jewish people from their babylonian captivity .
ironically , this was happening at a time when iran was more interested in peacemaking with washington than to see to israel &apos;s destruction .
if we accept this to be true , that indeed it is 1938 , iran is germany , ahmadinejad is hitler , then the question we have to ask ourself is , who wishes to play the role of neville chamberlain ?
well , there was too much of a correlation , he felt , between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water , and the judge was not impressed either .
each flash on this visualization -- put together by ito world -- shows an edit in 2009 made to the open street map .
now , lesters in lesterland have this extraordinary power .
really .05 percent ?
i don &apos;t mean rod blagojevich sense of corruption .
block reform .
and to do this does not require a constitutional amendment , changing the first amendment .
i spoke at dartmouth once , and a woman stood up after i spoke , i write in my book , and she said to me , &quot; professor , you &apos;ve convinced me this is hopeless . hopeless .
lawrence lessig : we the people , and the republic we must reclaim
for example , some here will remember this day , june 1958 , the national civil defense drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
&quot; okay , josh , why don &apos;t we give you some -- why don &apos;t we give you some zyprexa .
everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
so to put the question a little more seriously , let &apos;s ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did , for spontaneous synchronization .
second , all the individuals have a tendency to line up .
there doesn &apos;t seem to be anything mystical about this .
scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it , or , you know , a human being &apos;s tendency to see patterns where there are none .
can you hear that ?
and together they submitted a design based on lord foster &apos;s vision , which was -- he remembered as a kid reading flash gordon comic books , and he said that when flash gordon would come to an abyss , he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber .
interviewer : ah ! now , tell me why you had to do this ?
interviewer : you didn &apos;t expect . engineer : exactly .
their instructions : just walk normally .
and when you go into the supermarket , you certainly don &apos;t see a lot of choices there .
so , i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fowler apple is still out there .
in short , the answer is that in the future , in many countries , the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past .
if you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers , you dry it and then you freeze it .
it &apos;s a tunnel , and you go into the tunnel , chiseled in solid rock , about 130 meters .
i can &apos;t look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things , or the energy crisis , or world hunger , or peace in conflict .
it &apos;s time again to talk about &quot; inconvenient truth , &quot; a truth that everyone is concerned about , but nobody is willing to talk about .
another benefit of wi-fi , we learned yesterday about the benefits of wi-fi .
we &apos;re entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space . in fact , we &apos;ve regressed .
there &apos;s only been two concepts tried -- two by the u.s. and one by the russians .
three years , and we can &apos;t do that now . crazy .
and it will be sub-orbital . and the reason it has to be sub-orbital is , there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit . the governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died .
there were a couple of examples here .
i think what we &apos;ll do is we &apos;ll see a successful , very successful , private space flight industry . whether we &apos;re first or not really doesn &apos;t matter .
humanity is building a machine , and this enables us to collaborate in new ways .
well , as it turns out , openness has a number of different meanings , and for each there &apos;s a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization .
your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night .
so this is good . it &apos;s not bad .
knowledge and intelligence is power , and as it becomes more distributed , there &apos;s a concomitant distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that &apos;s underway in the world today .
the horse is out of the barn . help me out here , okay ?
i &apos;ve tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like , but i &apos;ve been studying nature recently .
good afternoon .
in total , there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide , that all look on the surface to be different from one another , but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator .
so , if angiogenesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one , then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply .
and over the course of six months , he experienced a complete remission .
so here &apos;s a test system we developed .
you can see , they clearly hold their own and , in some cases , they &apos;re more potent than the actual drugs .
restart the treatment , loses the weight again .
and that &apos;s certainly something that anybody can look into .
now , that was my first puzzle . i got hooked .
so , one thing i found early on , when i started doing computer games , is that i could create puzzles that will alter your perception .
and a marvelous fellow from the media lab who just got appointed head of risd , is john maeda .
it &apos;s like the old maxim of &quot; you can tell somebody something and show them , but if they do it they really learn it . &quot;
in the other game the cars can only move forward and back .
which separations were mixed up to make those pictures ?
everybody now considers themselves a creator , and not just a viewer .
yeah , i &apos;ve played this image before , but even when i make up my own puzzles -- and you can put your own images in here .
to be a leader means not to be a girl .
i want to say that i think the powers that be know that empire-building is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building .
we silence them . we make them feel guilty for being smart . we get them to behave , to tone it down , not to be too intense .
and she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank .
and in the years that agnes has had the house , she has changed the situation there .
he said , &quot; you are beautiful . you have grown into a gorgeous woman .
they pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears .
this is not extreme . it &apos;s a girl thing , what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open .
that &apos;s the shooter i saw that killed the father . &quot;
it happens to us in all the aspects of our life , all the time .
i testified to that to the court , and while the judge was very attentive , it had been a very , very long hearing for this petition for a retrial , and as a result , i noticed out of the corner of my eye that i thought that maybe the judge was going to need a little more of a nudge than just more numbers .
furthermore , the roof of the car is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car which is making it darker .
we all have to be very careful .
it &apos;s the same pattern at many different scales .
and he said , &quot; oh yeah , yeah ! we knew about a rectangle within a rectangle , we know all about that . &quot;
and they said , &quot; well , we can take you there , but you can &apos;t go inside because that &apos;s the sacred altar , where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields . &quot;
no , because a widely shared design practice doesn &apos;t necessarily give you a unity of culture -- and it definitely is not &quot; in the dna . &quot;
here &apos;s a wonderful fractal .
and finally , out of desperation , i said , &quot; well , let me explain georg cantor in 1877 . &quot;
george boole took leibniz &apos;s binary code and created boolean algebra , and john von neumann took boolean algebra and created the digital computer .
and if you don &apos;t think that capitalism , which is self-organizing , can have destructive effects , you haven &apos;t opened your eyes enough .
so how can we change this dynamic ?
in 1983 , jeff sutherland was a technologist at a financial firm in new england .
so on the morning i visited , eleanor came downstairs , poured herself a cup of coffee , sat in a reclining chair , and she sat there , kind of amiably talking to each of her children as one after the other they came downstairs , checked the list , made themselves breakfast , checked the list again , put the dishes in the dishwasher , rechecked the list , fed the pets or whatever chores they had , checked the list once more , gathered their belongings , and made their way to the bus .
so they would come up with all these ideas .
let &apos;s take the biggest issue of all : family dinner .
our instinct as parents is to order our kids around .
children who plan their own goals , set weekly schedules , evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex and take more control over their lives .
this family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right .
but as i began working on this project , i began changing my mind .
you &apos;re about to experience a new , available and exciting technology that &apos;s going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives .
you &apos;d think it &apos;d be smooth , but it &apos;s actually not .
and i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here and that i &apos;m meeting you here at ted .
so that &apos;s what i have to say .
mt : and when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination , he would build them in his workshop .
dodged by death , he spent much of his time in his suite at the waldorf-astoria .
so this was the thinking back then , and these individuals made these holes .
now the first example i &apos;m going to show you is a patient with parkinson &apos;s disease , and this lady has parkinson &apos;s disease , and she has these electrodes in her brain , and i &apos;m going to show you what she &apos;s like when the electrodes are turned off and she has her parkinson &apos;s symptoms , and then we &apos;re going to turn it on .
he did not respond to any drugs .
so now we are in clinical trials , and are in phase iii clinical trials , and this may become a new procedure , if it &apos;s safe and we find that it &apos;s effective , to treat patients with severe depression .
the lights are out in these areas of the brain .
i want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation .
and then they alternate in their propulsion , but the patterns are all the same . almost every organism we &apos;ve looked at this way -- you &apos;ll see next week , i &apos;ll give you a hint , there &apos;ll be an article coming out that says that really big things like t. rex probably couldn &apos;t do this , but you &apos;ll see that next week .
it &apos;s a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like , and put in the material properties .
it moves in a gait that an insect uses , and here it is going on the treadmill . now , what &apos;s important about this robot , compared to other robots , is that it can &apos;t see anything , it can &apos;t feel anything , it doesn &apos;t have a brain , yet it can maneuver over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever .
here &apos;s a legged version and a tractor version , or a bulldozer version .
and if you blow those up , they have these little structures on the end .
clearly , the internet is already having eyes and ears , you have web cams and so forth . but it &apos;s going to also have legs and hands .
you let it cool to room temperature , and then , as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side , it creates a powerful cooling effect .
and if you &apos;re in this room today , most of us grew up in a world where we had basic civil rights , and amazingly , we still live in a world where some women don &apos;t have them .
i want to start out by saying , i talk about this -- about keeping women in the workforce -- because i really think that &apos;s the answer .
and then he had these two women who were traveling with him who were pretty senior in his department , and i kind of said to them , &quot; sit at the table . come on , sit at the table , &quot; and they sat on the side of the room .
obviously . why are you even asking ? &quot;
we have to tell our daughters and our colleagues , we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the a , to reach for the promotion , to sit at the table , and we have to do it in a world where , for them , there are sacrifices they will make for that , even though for their brothers , there are not .
i know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers , and it &apos;s hard .
stay in .
those are all behaviors where people know what they &apos;re supposed to do .
they showed bloody gums .
we don &apos;t really know how to manipulate it , though , that well .
but the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there -- personalized data , it &apos;s been pretty hard to come by .
actually , it &apos;s a spoof . it &apos;s not a real pharmaceutical ad .
so i love this . i love that drug facts box .
but again , always using color and personalized proximity to that information .
and so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that .
and then , what &apos;s next ?
i was here , planting my chunks , cutting up potatoes and planting it , and the bees were working on this tree ; bumblebees , just making this thing vibrate .
i had thought always -- and in fact , had written this in my first book ; this was a book about gardening -- that lawns were nature under culture &apos;s boot , that they were totalitarian landscapes , and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species and never letting it set seed or die or have sex .
but , you know , there &apos;s a comedian who said , &quot; well , who &apos;s telling me that consciousness is so good and so important ?
this is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia .
and third , while they &apos;re in this paddock they are , of course , defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field .
it &apos;s a remarkably hopeful thing to do .
and i was influenced by performance art -- so this is 20 years ago . i made a computer out of people .
we &apos;re kind of stuck in a loop , perhaps , and this sense of possibility from computing is something i &apos;ve been questioning for the last 10 or so years , and have looked to design , as we understand most things , and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine .
it feels great . or even free spread out , it &apos;s like , ah , i can breathe in free , so easily .
it &apos;s peaceful , like that .
and he saw , over and over , the antique &apos;s value was all about it being old .
because in many senses , a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes .
what is the tenor of their email ? how is it working out ?
so , that &apos;s unfortunate .
that &apos;s really , really powerful , and it &apos;s going to be more important than the social layer .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve all heard of farmville by now .
it &apos;s used in your wallets , right now .
i am only 85 percent complete on linkedin , and that bothers me .
and they made this into a game , initially .
we spoke to you last several years ago .
but you can also see , there are places where there &apos;s not so much .
but it didn &apos;t have quite the same pickup in the u.s .
we find that they work better when they &apos;re submerged and covered with leaves .
and i think many other things in the world also have come out of this .
how many of you use the deskbar ?
it makes it a really fun place to work .
so we always hope that google will be smart , but we &apos;re always surprised when other people think that it is .
and i think decisions we &apos;re able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world , and it makes me really proud to be involved with google .
his greatest creation runs actually right through here in oxford .
and i &apos;d like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes .
partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory , they used the basement of one of their hospitals .
now the industrial systems of brunel &apos;s time have run their course , and indeed they are part of the problem today .
that by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly , by getting the process out of the hands of designers , and by getting the active participation of the community , we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions .
&quot; i understand , &quot; i said , &quot; that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea , but i &apos;d like to put some sugar in my green tea . &quot;
but do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice ?
to insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships .
combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better , and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters and so every choice matters .
but it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the pressure of ever-increasing choice .
we found that it did .
no single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere .
and the other one was called &quot; adorable . &quot;
on the top line , this is the bp oil spill : billions of barrels of oil gushing in the gulf of mexico .
normally it &apos;s at the back .
a fish will move because -- by changing like this , but our boat is propelled by the wind still , and the hull controls the trajectory .
and i started this project alone in a garage in new orleans , but quickly after i wanted to publish and share this information , so i made a kickstarter , which is a crowd-fundraising platform , and in about one month we fundraised 30,000 dollars .
and we replace the human being -- to go , for example , for measuring radioactivity , you don &apos;t want a human to be sailing those robots -- with batteries , motors , micro-controllers and sensors .
let me give you an example of this . the year is 1976 , and warner buys atari because video games are on the rise .
so take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers , and the computer begins to express itself .
they adapt whirlwind to a massive air defense system , deploy it all across the frozen north , and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the manhattan project building the a-bomb in the first place .
so , the next time they tell you they &apos;re on to something , clearly they &apos;re not .
then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set , and rub it out from the center to the corners , like this .
if you substitute the word blogosphere , of the internet today , it is very true that his understanding is probably very enlightening now . let &apos;s listen in to him .
and into that ferment came the microprocessor .
this method allows you to use existing videodisc materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests .
in 1939 , the radio corporation of america introduced television .
it &apos;s a customer , it &apos;s an audience , it &apos;s a person who &apos;s participating .
ph : the company that created this , aniboom , is an interesting example of where this is headed . traditional tv animation costs , say , between 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute .
there &apos;s been more raw dna of communications and media thrown out there . content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth , and part of social communications , and i think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity .
i then kind of thought about the other cities in europe where i spend a lot of time looking for design , like basel , where vitra is located , or in northern italy -- all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles , and where pedestrian areas -- and i came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic , and i &apos;m sure the skeptic eye would say , no , the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can &apos;t afford cars , but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected .
it takes your attention ; it has a great amount of emotion ; it stares back at you the way that a figure might .
in our area , in furnishings , they &apos;re sort of way at the top .
and at that moment , the sun came out , and through this perforated screen , a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear , and we left the restaurant kind of feeling o.k. about stuff .
can really take a leadership role , and chicago is one example .
and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes .
went through design , some architecture .
and that &apos;s the way i work now .
he came over and looked at it .
would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone ?
ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area , right there .
now let &apos;s assume you go on holiday .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember which , i saw a reuters report that said madeira had had their first cases of dengue , about 52 cases , with about 400 probable cases .
we want something that gets that population right the way down so it can &apos;t get the disease transmission .
a single female will lay about up to 100 eggs at a time , up to about 500 in her lifetime .
so freight costs aren &apos;t our biggest problem .
my train was a heart attack .
and if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
so , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
if you really studied that you might have some clues as to what paul likes to do .
just look at that for a minute .
and a message saying , &quot; hey , it &apos;s me . i miss you .
you don &apos;t write a psalm .
so , instead of trying to find the ideal type or the ideal average , he &apos;d always look for the exception . so , in this example , which is an example of what &apos;s called bateson &apos;s rule , he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb .
and in this example , you can see that the components of this stair are repetitive , but they &apos;re repetitive without being modular .
so , the 300 series , or whatever their newest car is , the 100 series that &apos;s coming out , has to look like the 700 series , at the other end of their product line , so they need a distinct , coherent identity , which is bmw .
and you can see that that change in massing also gives all 48 of the apartments a unique shape and size , but always within a , kind of , controlled limit , an envelope of change .
this is what our planet looks like from outer space at nighttime , if you were to take a satellite and travel around the planet . and the thing you would notice first , of course , is how dominant the human presence on our planet is .
if you put it all together in one place , it &apos;d be the size of south america .
they really needed the money .
well , that &apos;s the future we have to look forward to .
so more people , eating more stuff , and richer stuff , and of course having an energy crisis at the same time , where we have to replace oil with other energy sources that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels and bio-energy sources .
and i love silver buckshot . you put it together and you &apos;ve got something really powerful , but we need to put them together .
that &apos;s enough to fill 7,305 empire state buildings every day .
how do we feed the world without destroying it ?
i think it &apos;s really important to understand that something like this is totally open . it &apos;s right there for you to find .
it &apos;s a business plan for a corporation .
you can buy cloned cologne .
and in particular , i want to talk about the design of diarrhea .
diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways .
and that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera .
she got rehydration therapy , she perked up , within a few days she was looking like a completely different person .
it would make these organisms evolve to mildness , so that even though people might be getting infected , they &apos;d be infected with mild strains .
and the example i want to deal with is , or the idea i want to deal with , the question is , what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness ?
so they did . they divided northern alabama into 11 zones , and within three years , about 100 dollars per house , they mosquito proofed every house .
so , i don &apos;t really have time to talk about those things , but i did want to put them up there , just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we &apos;re confronted with .
and when you lose one , far less both , it &apos;s a lot harder to do the things we physically need to do .
you open it , these muscles contract .
and these are very exciting research areas , but it &apos;s really , really hard .
so my colleague , dr. greg dumanian , did the surgery .
so this is really exciting for us , because now we have a portal , a portal , or a way to potentially give back sensation , so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand .
and how did that work for you ?
but i can &apos;t put in an electrode and say , &quot; go there . &quot;
so amanda , you can see , has really good control .
so for example , one is to get rid of my real estate problem and get better signals .
she told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance .
how then can we ensure that , in our search for the cure , we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic ?
now , researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed .
and one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback .
and that &apos;s what i came to study .
that means that there &apos;s no upwelling , and there &apos;s basically no food .
penguins don &apos;t like oil and they don &apos;t like to swim through oil .
try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins .
so this is turbo .
you can see this penguin , he goes over , he looks at those wires , does not like that wire .
but that &apos;s not apathy ; that &apos;s intentional exclusion .
someone came up to them and said , &quot; you &apos;re the chosen one .
it &apos;s like trying to run into a brick wall .
now here at ted , we &apos;re solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe .
and as you know , china is the most populous .
they set up their own bazaars and medical clinics .
specifically , it targets japan and korea and australia , countries that are strong allies of the united states .
so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world ?
30 years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict .
now it &apos;s their oil for their own purposes .
in fact most of that happened on just one day .
this is the flag that flies in the minds of 20 million pashtuns who live on both sides of the afghan and pakistan border .
thank you .
so the first thing you &apos;re going to see is the normal worm when it &apos;s about college student age -- a young adult .
you would never know , until she told you .
and the hormone igf-1 promotes growth .
so how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging ?
well we think that insulin and igf-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions -- in the good times -- when food is plentiful and there &apos;s not a lot of stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details of how this works , but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .
you could change the genes in principle .
they &apos;re more resistant to these kinds of stresses .
now , part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders .
but can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion-like states ?
so we quantified this behavior using custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator pietro perona , who &apos;s in the electrical engineering division here at caltech .
well , if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies , they don &apos;t learn . their learning score is zero .
modern psychiatric drugs treat the chemistry of the whole brain , but neurobiologist david anderson believes in a more nuanced view of how the brain functions . he illuminates new research that could lead to targeted psychiatric medications -- that work better and avoid side effects . how &apos;s he doing it ? for a start , by making a bunch of fruit flies angry .
now solving this puzzle was not an easy thing , because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin , but we undertook some remarkable experiments that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed .
they can &apos;t escape from that water . they can &apos;t fly .
here in this box i have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitos that i &apos;m just about to release .
but perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators -- a matter which was debated in the parliament -- that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country .
in my team , the lives of one or two of my colleagues were tainted by this experience .
but in 2007 , two remarkable individuals , shinya yamanaka of japan and jamie thomson of the united states , made an astounding discovery .
heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide .
we are very happy to have the possibility to be with you in the other side of the world .
and researchers want to know why .
these are couples who can find good in any situation .
and it &apos;s not just successfully starring in films that &apos;s dangerous .
and like i said , we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up .
in this simulation , each black dot is one nerve cell .
galvani &apos;s approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today , despite a number of drawbacks .
in this example , each electrical impulse , each deflection on the trace , is caused by a brief pulse of light .
now to put some neurobiological meat on this abstract model , we constructed a simple one-dimensional world for our favorite subject , fruit flies .
optically activating these hundred or so cells into two strains of flies has dramatically different consequences .
that caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors .
in fact , these professionals were miracle workers , but they &apos;re working in a flawed , expensive system that &apos;s set up the wrong way .
thomas batuik : hi there , eric .
we have got to untether clinicians and patients from the notion of traveling to a special bricks-and-mortar place for all of our care , because these places are often the wrong tool , and the most expensive tool , for the job .
i had a care coordination problem .
the first was quite simple . i finally realized some years ago that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity .
but until such time that these amazing technologies are available to all of us , and even when they are , it &apos;s up to us to care for , and even save , one another .
you can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid- &apos; 70s , but it matches up pretty well with the second industrial revolution , when factories were learning how to electrify their operations .
but there &apos;s a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world .
the next day , it started answering questions with profanities .
people are racing against the machine , and many of them are losing that race .
now , being a biologist , i was very curious about this .
but she actually used these on smooth surfaces -- two of them -- to climb up , and pull herself up .
we know that you can grab onto things with them .
this is incredible .
there it is .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
if you really want to understand the problem that we &apos;re facing with the oceans , you have to think about the biology at the same time you think about the physics .
should it be 450 ? should it be 400 ?
we inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere , and we have trace gases , and not just carbon dioxide -- it &apos;s methane , ozone , oxides of sulfur and nitrogen .
and we made the very first bore hole through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet .
and that alternates with a sediment that looks like this .
this is from champion island .
the core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone .
in this case , at these islands , you know , corals are instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water .
and there &apos;s the temperature up there in 2009 .
so we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track co2 levels in the atmosphere , going back millions of years .
so basically what i &apos;d like to talk about today is a way for people to travel , to meet people in a different way than -- because you can &apos;t travel all over the world at the same time .
and i began to start teaching there .
so i knew that i had to go there .
and then what hit me was , the night before , there had been some kind of bombing in basra , and al jazeera had shown images of the people .
this woman came up to me after the screening and said , &quot; you know , i know this is crazy . i saw the bombs being loaded on the planes ; i saw the military going out to war .
don &apos;t you see what you &apos;re doing is destroying us ?
george : there were many things that touched me .
i watched it and i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m blown away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world , independent voices from around the world , and create a truly democratic , global television .
so what we &apos;d like to call this day of film is pangea cinema day .
all of that could be described using newton &apos;s work .
so kaluza said to himself , einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space -- in fact , space and time , to be more precise .
but if we zoom in and take the perspective of , say , a little ant walking around -- little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions -- the long dimension , but also this clockwise , counter-clockwise direction .
so deep inside -- we all know , you go sufficiently far down , you have atoms .
it leads us right back to this idea of kaluza and klein -- that our world , when appropriately described , has more dimensions than the ones that we see .
and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like , then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales .
but here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
let &apos;s find out what the reality is .
this is a huge problem because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real-world sources .
beau lotto : &quot; what are you reading ? &quot; half the letters are missing . right ?
it means that i can take these two identical squares , and i can put them in light and dark surrounds .
the four blue tiles on the left are gray .
and they go back and forth between this hive and the arena , via this tube .
instead , color tells us something completely different , that the brain didn &apos;t actually evolve to see the world the way it is .
what this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature . okay ?
and corruption is defined as the abuse of a position of trust for the benefit of yourself -- or , in the case of our context , your friends , your family or your financiers .
we &apos;re standing today in the central bank , and the central bank is responsible for a lot of the things i &apos;m going to be speaking about .
and it was called , those people are called the piarco airport accused .
and what we have here -- i am not saying so , this is the director of public prosecutions in a written statement . he said so .
cl financial is the caribbean &apos;s largest ever conglomerate , okay ?
but the point is that the bitter experience of section 34 , that plot to pervert parliament , that bitter experience that took place in august , when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence , going into september , forced me to check myself and recalculate my bearings , and to go back into some of the work , some of the stuff i &apos;d written and some of the exchanges i &apos;d had with the officials to see what was really what .
and i want to pause again to bring up context , because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing .
and this is my reality check .
and they &apos;re different .
we make these trade-offs again and again , multiple times a day .
the unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar .
so one half , one quarter , one fifth -- we &apos;re good at that .
not enough examples .
but it has the ability to override our feelings .
i mean , there were people who were afraid to push doorbells , because there was electricity in there , and that was dangerous .
we have feeling , model , reality .
we can do to the next harvest .
one , you can fix people &apos;s feelings , directly appeal to feelings .
i &apos;ll give you one , a syringe .
all these things , they come back to plants .
we have 120 partner institutions all over the world , in all those countries colored orange .
twenty-five percent of all the world &apos;s plants , by 2020 .
so what happened when the professor left the room ?
a few had good grades .
they are teaching these kids exactly this principle .
and that &apos;s really where we started , the idea coalesced around , let &apos;s make this a park , and let &apos;s have it be sort of inspired by this wildscape .
and the first section ends at 20th st. right now .
and i can tell you , our agenda is full .
so we &apos;ve spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others .
now everybody agrees .
should we talk to hamas ?
and he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked .
and we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times , climate change .
she says , &quot; oh , that &apos;s beautiful .
so , one of the things that i love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites .
jo anne and i have just embarked on a project to digitize them all , and we &apos;re going to do a very high-res digitization , first because it &apos;s a way of preserving them .
changing into a totally different field , we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics , particularly in an area called metamaterials .
but if you get to play with all those knobs and dials -- and of course , really the controller over there does it all on software -- you can make some terrific ribs .
i said , &quot; well , you know , it &apos;s just a movie ! come on . &quot;
you know .
there &apos;s a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex .
having explained those , that will set up for what i think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asian person and a european person by looking at their ingredients list .
but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that .
i mean , i see patients dying every day because we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on inside of them .
but we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it .
and many people in this audience probably wouldn &apos;t be alive if doctors didn &apos;t do this .
and i &apos;m not saying you shouldn &apos;t mop up your water if you have cancer , but i &apos;m saying that &apos;s not really the problem ; that &apos;s the symptom of the problem .
and so i believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future .
we said , &quot; the tribes that we &apos;re in are saying it &apos;s going to be obama . &quot;
this is the kid who shot up virginia tech .
i mean , if i got to go to tedx usc my life wouldn &apos;t suck . but i don &apos;t . so it does . &quot;
now , we find these in places where really smart , successful people show up .
stage four tribes can do remarkable things .
&quot; my life sucks because i live under a tyrant , also known as king george .
i &apos;d like to show you some examples of this .
so it &apos;s stage four . we &apos;re great . who is not great ?
these are , most of these are from a monthly page i do in and architecture and design magazine called metropolis .
adults find it comforting .
over the next 200 years we see the infant christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the virgin &apos;s lap , and then back again .
in 1962 the unsold stock was purchased by maurice haverpiece , a wealthy prune juice bottler , and consolidated to form the core collection .
compassion is a worthy successor .
and compassion does seek physicality .
we need those things too , but we &apos;re also bumping up against their limits .
some of his favorites were moses , jesus , buddha , st. francis of assisi , gandhi -- he adored his contemporary , gandhi .
so i want to propose a final definition of compassion -- this is einstein with paul robeson by the way -- and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology .
and then the second time i tried it , the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing .
not all the time -- these things aren &apos;t absolute -- but a lot of the time .
and we all fall at different points , of course , along the introvert / extrovert spectrum .
so ...
the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust .
so i just published a book about introversion , and it took me about seven years to write .
be like buddha , have your own revelations .
i learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world .
a tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the internet .
but we &apos;re excited in our company ; we &apos;re motivated .
it &apos;s a country of 45 million people . it &apos;s an economy that &apos;s emerging .
because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours , and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it .
hector ruiz , the executive chair of amd , wants to give internet access to everyone . in this talk , he shares his extraordinary life story and describes amd &apos;s 50x15 initiative that calls for connecting 50 percent of the world by 2015 .
i think that comes down to this issue of meaning , of significance , of purpose .
you &apos;re betting your life on something -- you just better know why you &apos;re betting what you &apos;re betting on .
when he said the word &quot; species , &quot; he was revealing his worldview .
in fact , personally , i &apos;ve never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money .
so , the good life is not about looking good , feeling good or having the goods ; it &apos;s about being good and doing good .
and it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make if you were going to pray .
moses says , &quot; it &apos;s a staff .
he was a shepherd . it &apos;s the symbol of his own occupation .
so , what are you going to do with what you &apos;ve been given ? &quot;
he made you . and when you do what you were made to do , he goes , &quot; that &apos;s my boy .
they &apos;ve leapfrogged .
you and i didn &apos;t have 10,000 books when we went to primary school .
right , the famous chinese character for picnic area .
realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
so by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits -- and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
so this is a huge practical problem .
augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
and something else happened instead .
most of us will do anything to avoid being wrong . but what if we &apos;re wrong about that ? &quot; wrongologist &quot; kathryn schulz makes a compelling case for not just admitting but embracing our fallibility .
these are the athabasca tar sands , and there &apos;s an enormous amount -- first of mining , the largest trucks in the world are working here , and then you &apos;ve got to pull out this black sludge , which is basically oil that doesn &apos;t flow . it &apos;s tied to the sand . and then you &apos;ve got to use a lot of steam to separate it , which only works at today &apos;s oil prices .
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons . that means 86 percent of the stuff we &apos;re consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff . and there &apos;s a role in here for conservation . there &apos;s a role in here for alternative stuff , but we &apos;ve also got to get that other portion right .
her job , her goal and her calling was not to become the world &apos;s greatest toilet scrubber .
so i realized in that dotcom crash that my role in life was to channel abe maslow .
it &apos;s actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world .
one of those key indicators is : how do the bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day ?
co-branding opportunities .
he said , &quot; if the only tool you have is a hammer , everything starts to look like a nail . &quot;
so what the world needs now , in my opinion , is business leaders and political leaders who know what to count .
ow ! ow !
right ? it &apos;s adaptable to change . right ? it opens possibility , and it &apos;s cooperative . it &apos;s actually how we do our social bonding , and it &apos;s intrinsically motivated . what that means is that we play to play . play is its own reward .
really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . so what if bees can think like us ?
the one on the left is mine , okay ?
it was the editors &apos; choice in science , which is a top science magazine .
where &apos;s the sound coming from ?
not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming , but there &apos;s a place called &quot; cancer alley , &quot; and the reason it &apos;s called &quot; cancer alley &quot; is because the petrochemical industry takes that oil and turns it into plastic and , in the process , kills people .
not you , but i feel this way .
well the root of this problem , in my view , is the idea of disposability itself .
i don &apos;t mean looking at it from that way -- abusing the little species .
and so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement .
and so the next -- over the next six decades , believe it or not , i &apos;ve built a number of aircraft , with the goal of creating something that could do for you , or me , what the hummingbird does , and give you that flexibility .
i &apos;m sure any of you have asked the question , yeah , are there great things up there -- what am i going to do , get up there ?
how would a trip in a skycar work ?
at least for the hover , and the low-speed flight .
if one of those fails , you still have a second chance .
thank you .
40 billion of these things built .
and if you can bring another device close enough to the source , that will only work at exactly that frequency , you can actually get them to do what &apos;s called strongly couple , and transfer magnetic energy between them .
then there &apos;s all kinds of other applications . implanted medical devices , where people don &apos;t have to die of infections anymore if you can seal the thing up .
we &apos;re an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .
eric giler : a demo of wireless electricity
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies , we deny death , poison the living and further harm the environment .
first , a burial suit infused with mushroom spores , the mushroom death suit .
i &apos;d pump him for information , i &apos;m mentally scribbling notes for the stories i plan to write .
and yet , he did not die .
there &apos;s another drug out there .
we both did .
just days before terence died , his oncologist said , &quot; tell terence that better days are just ahead . &quot;
so i &apos;ll give you a couple lines from him .
what does this all mean for us ?
we fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air .
we took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities , and that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream .
here you see a graph showing you the different types of crops that are being considered for making biofuels , so you can see some things like soybean , which makes 50 gallons per acre per year , or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm , and that tall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute .
and finally , because it &apos;s an offshore structure , we can think in terms of how it might contribute to an aquaculture activity offshore .
i mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system , and finally we looked at the economics , and what i mean by economics is , what is the energy required to run the system ?
i set out to find a pathway to innovative production of sustainable biofuels , and en route i discovered that what &apos;s really required for sustainability is integration more than innovation .
over the last 30 years , in terms of the gdp growth rates , china has grown at twice the rate of india .
if you believe that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe , then you will put less emphasis on strong government .
in developing countries , the most common mode of transportation is the railways , and the british built a lot of railways in india .
in east asia , we have had successful economic growth stories such as korea , taiwan , hong kong and singapore .
and this is the earliest data that i can find .
these are the two pictures taken of garment factories in guangdong province and garment factories in india .
and my own view is the country is going to face some substantial challenges , because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms .
india has the right institutional conditions for economic growth , whereas china is still struggling with political reforms .
this was their conjugal bed , in a sense -- ideas would get together there .
these are standard in all the industrialized worlds .
this is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together , where people were likely to have new , interesting , unpredictable collisions -- people from different backgrounds .
that &apos;s in his autobiography .
and they start talking , and one of them says , &quot; hey , has anybody tried to listen for this thing ?
and they came back and said , &quot; actually , it &apos;ll be easier . &quot;
today , their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent .
a lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of &quot; crony capitalism , &quot; political changes that benefit a group of well-connected insiders but don &apos;t actually do much good for the rest of us .
there are even , and this is my personal favorite example , superstar dentists , the most dazzling exemplar of whom is bernard touati , the frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like russian oligarch roman abramovich or european-born american fashion designer diane von furstenberg .
one way of describing the plutocrats is as alpha geeks , and they are people who are acutely aware of how important highly sophisticated analytical and quantitative skills are in today &apos;s economy .
after all , for all its grim , satanic mills , it worked out pretty well , didn &apos;t it ?
this has been fantastic .
i thought , &quot; okay . take this steady . &quot;
so one of these will happen to all of us .
anyway , we had a major cultural issue .
i think we have to get onto this .
we can &apos;t control if we &apos;ll die , but we can &quot; occupy death , &quot; in the words of dr. peter saul . he calls on us to make clear our preferences for end of life care -- and suggests two questions for starting the conversation . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i was 14 , and i emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab . and hardly anyone responded .
it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury .
it &apos;s the part of cancer that is the most dangerous .
we use skeletal muscles so much . it &apos;s the one portion of our body -- our heart &apos;s always beating . we &apos;re always moving our muscles .
but when the body is actually initiating a process and we &apos;re calling it a disease , it doesn &apos;t seem as though elimination is the right solution . so even to go from there , it &apos;s possible , although far-fetched , that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy .
and i was paying for this myself , so i asked the translator if it would be ok if i stayed for the week .
when the teachers would ask questions , she &apos;d be the first person to raise her hand .
so , i asked the translator why she thought she was dying .
and myung sung , under some pressure from me and the translator , gave us an address on the outside of seoul .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m staying in a hotel downtown .
and you can see how different she looks just in three months .
so , it was a really big deal when the letters showed up .
so , tim and i slept on the floor , natasha got one bed , gene got the other -- kids pass out , it &apos;s been very exciting for three days .
one was absolute terror -- it &apos;s like , &quot; oh , please god , i just want to wake up .
in any case , 12 hours later , i mean , they put us in the lobby .
and the pilot , i actually knew -- because they used to let me sit in the jump seat , to tell you how long ago this was .
now , a lot of parents , when they adopt , actually want to erase their children &apos;s history .
i started crying .
&quot; what is life ? what is the origin of life ?
so we count many , many such planets , and they have different sizes .
in the next few years we will confirm them .
we need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that .
now it &apos;s about something else , but it &apos;s equally profound .
i mean look , you can see the necktie , but you can &apos;t even imagine seeing the size of a little , small atom .
now , you can see united states , in 1983 , had a very low percentage infected , but due to the big population , still a sizable bubble .
botswana -- upper middle-income country in southern africa , democratic government , good economy , and this is what happened there .
so , why is it so high ? is it war ?
but where are they situated ?
vodka , midsummer &apos;s eve -- new partner for the fall .
economic historians call this &quot; the great divergence . &quot;
in any case , as you may remember , the great divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s , some considerable time after decolonization .
so let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a scotsman .
and six , the work ethic .
that &apos;s another killer app .
take a look at mathematical attainment by 15 year-olds .
that &apos;s the one that john locke systematized when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights and the protection of law .
i once asked one of my colleagues at harvard , &quot; hey , is south america part of the west ? &quot;
this red dot marks the great basin of north america , and i &apos;m involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators .
to answer that , you have to look a lot closer at the spinneret region of a spider .
to give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like , this is a dragline silk protein , it &apos;s just a portion of it , from the black widow spider .
if it wasn &apos;t able to stretch so much , then basically when an insect hit the web , it would just trampoline right off of it .
and what you can see is that nearly all the spider draglines surpass them .
you found an institution , and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group .
to draw those people into some prearranged structure that has explicit goals .
right . you &apos;ll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone , and you stopped making plans .
so , the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter .
and here &apos;s the photo . right . labeled , &quot; bad day at work . &quot;
and you can see why , from ballmer &apos;s point of view , that &apos;s a bad idea , right ?
in the united states right now , a woman named judith miller is in jail for not having given to a federal grand jury her sources -- she &apos;s a reporter for the new york times -- her sources , in a very abstract and hard-to-follow case .
we &apos;re used to support groups being beneficial .
thank you very much .
it &apos;s hydrated dough we call &quot; the soaker &quot; -- that helps to start enzyme activity .
the yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars , creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it &apos;s burping and sweating , which is what bread is .
when it gets to about 160 degrees , the proteins all line up and they create structure , the gluten structure -- what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread .
it &apos;s just a euphemism for killing , right ?
it &apos;s like clay .
so you see the symbolism at work ? it &apos;s starting to come forth a little bit , you know .
and so this is , again , hopefully not only a healthy bread , but a bread that you will enjoy .
i had to practice it as a kid , and i &apos;m really sick of it . so -- i would , so what i might like to try to do is to change it , to transform it in some ways , to personalize it , so i might take the opening , like this idea -- and then i might substitute -- and then i might improvise on that melody that goes forward from there -- so that might be the kind of thing -- why thank you .
i &apos;m crying on the inside . there are still scars .
they follow the second hands , and as they pass over the various symbols , the players respond musically .
okay ? but then there was this other stuff , right ?
anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
and what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
other creatures , like the crows , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
and essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
he told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
if we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
it &apos;s simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body .
it &apos;s not something you get in computer games at the moment , at all .
i got up the next morning , went to the computer and looked at the results , and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line , like i &apos;ve just demonstrated , and this is what i got instead .
we hired a team of physicists , software engineers and biologists to work on this , and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body , basically .
that &apos;s something that you cannot do right now .
and that &apos;s our first product that we &apos;re going to release in a couple of weeks .
it &apos;s a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach .
i think that &apos;s going to be incredibly exciting .
and what you see after a while -- i think he even goes into a climax right at the end .
at least an indian trying to get one of these american books in park slope , forget it .
i &apos;m like , &quot; dude , i &apos;m hindu . &quot;
now it &apos;s evening , and my dinner first grew cold -- and then grew mold .
ok , so why is the problem accelerating ? part of the problem is , ironically , because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use .
another one , a guy called -- this is absolutely true ! -- his computer had crashed , and he told the technician he couldn &apos;t restart it no matter how many times he typed 11 .
you can do buttons ; you can do sliders , pop-up menus , sub-menus .
i believe in consistency with possible , real-world equivalents , trashcan folder when possible , label things mostly .
you do not .
but there &apos;s also a new microsoft that &apos;s really doing good , simple interface designs .
other products cost less . other products had more features .
correct &quot; dissuade &quot; . &quot; not just . &quot;
and what i found was quite surprising .
so the solution has to be , as people like russell and einstein and others imagine in a conversation that existed in a much stronger form , i think , early in the 20th century , that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart .
things where , you know , a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome .
we &apos;re reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors .
so what we see is with these and other new materials that we can do things with different properties -- lighter , stronger -- and apply these new materials to the environmental problems .
you normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains .
but above all , what we have to do is we have to help the good guys , the people on the defensive side , have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .
because in the mid-1950s , when i was a tiny child , they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called sputnik , which sent the western world into a hysterical tailspin .
i think , myself , that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time .
how do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life ?
i always turn my head on the side , and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home , to seeing it as a planet .
this is very unusual for caves .
on the left you can see a lava tube forming at a recent eruption -- mount etna in sicily -- and this is the way these tubes form .
now , to wrap this up , i want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves .
doesn &apos;t it feel good to say it out loud ?
so audience , next time you &apos;re tempted to tell someone your goal , what will you say ?
and with just a magnifying glass , he transcribed as much of the text as he could .
and that glue is hide glue .
and in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the archimedes writing .
the thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this .
the really astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made , the scribe had made his book out of , and one of them was a manuscript containing text by hyperides .
why did the owner of the manuscript do this ?
because they already know what she looks like .
i became increasingly , kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know , why do people spend these crazy amounts of money , not only on wine but on lots of things , and are they living a better life than me ?
it &apos;s in the smell .
but no compliments .
unrelatedly -- japan is doing crazy things with toilets .
and , you know , when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods .
i went .
from about 10 billion in 1990 , it &apos;s worth 50 billion dollars globally today , and it shows no sign of slowing down .
because it &apos;s very powerful . it &apos;s pretty awesome .
and the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data .
but we &apos;re in virtuality . these aren &apos;t real boxes .
you break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you can use to point them towards individually beneficial activities .
and the second thing is confidence , that we can see how game-playing and reward structures make people braver , make them more willing to take risks , more willing to take on difficulty , harder to discourage .
and i just look at this , and i think , yes , we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets , by using elements of uncertainty , by using these multiple targets , by using a grand , underlying reward and incentive system , by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups , in terms of streets to collaborate and compete , to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see .
the most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome , but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation , diet , microbes and parasites and our immune response .
so it gives us virtual access to the lungs , which is where many important diseases reside .
but of course , you know at the u.n. , sometimes things move slowly , and they basically said no .
well , agriculture in america &apos;s very interesting .
i think , you know , it &apos;s not just in our own country , but really we &apos;re exporting the system around the world , and when you look at the data of least developed countries -- especially in cities , which are growing really rapidly -- people are eating american processed foods .
so i &apos;m hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the one campaign and slow food , which don &apos;t seem right now to have much in common , we can talk about holistic , long-term , systemic solutions that will improve food for everyone .
and we architects are cowards .
and then only after this is done are you allowed to do this , begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions .
because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building .
and that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium in a most unusual way .
it is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director .
the proscenium , also . as far as we know this is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space .
here it is in a flat floor configuration .
thank you .
so , around this time i was studying computer science at princeton university , and i noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts , not just from street corners , but also from the internet .
this provides a slightly more statistical look at things .
last may , i spent nine days living up in barrow , alaska , the northernmost settlement in the united states , with a family of inupiat eskimos , documenting their annual spring whale hunt .
i mean , in real life , things are much more nuanced and complex , and there &apos;s all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other .
so , here you see the cast . these are all of the people in &quot; the whale hunt &quot; and the two whales that were killed down here .
and then finally , i would ask them to make a wish .
there are these terrifyingly huge indian trucks that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic , with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road , and he was driving one of these trucks .
and i said , &quot; you mean , like a cave ? &quot; and she said , &quot; yeah , like a cave . &quot;
jh : so if you caught that , she said she hoped to die when she was around 40 . that was enough life for her .
and it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest suturing techniques , and he &apos;s the guy giving the lecture .
he had three or four friends with him , and he does that , and they all look , and there was no infection , and they bend over me and they &apos;re poking and prodding , and they &apos;re like , &quot; there &apos;s no hematomas , blah blah , look at the color , &quot; and they &apos;re talking amongst themselves and i &apos;m , like , this restored automobile that he &apos;s just going , &quot; yeah , i did that . &quot;
that &apos;s how much of a latterly thing writing is .
well , if you can speak like writing , then logically it follows that you might want to also sometimes write like you speak .
julie : &quot; lol thanks gmail is being slow right now &quot; now if you think about it , that &apos;s not funny .
it &apos;s used to change the scene .
1841 , some long-lost superintendent of schools is upset because of what he has for a long time &quot; noted with regret the almost entire neglect of the original &quot; blah blah blah blah blah .
and many of you out there are the heads of macromedia and microsoft , and in a way those are my bane : i think there &apos;s a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about what &apos;s possible on the computer .
how has this happened ?
if the al-qaeda base was to be established near ghazni , we would hit them very hard , and it would be very , very difficult for the taliban to protect them .
this man , for example , mullah mustafa , tried to shoot me .
or in 2007 , the norwegian deputy foreign minister , espen eide , to say that that would deliver the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
and there was not a single pashto speaker .
we criticized people a lot in bosnia for being quite slow to take on war criminals .
thank you .
how do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost ? how do you do it ?
the brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine , the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine .
and there are two bars . one bar indicates that the test is working , and if the second bar shows up , you &apos;re pregnant .
and the thing which you &apos;d most like to analyze , we &apos;re a fair distance from .
what you do about something which requires quantitative analysis ?
the answer is that what you do , and the details are not terribly important here , is to make something more elaborate : you take several different layers of paper , each one containing its own little fluid system , and you separate them by pieces of , literally , double-sided carpet tape , the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor .
and it &apos;s an important issue because it means that we have to , as a society , think about what we value .
and he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate -- of any race , of any party -- in history .
actually we didn &apos;t ask them , but when they conducted exit polls in every state , in 37 states , out of the 50 , they asked a question , that was pretty direct , about race .
and you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns .
but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will , &quot; do you favor a law banning interracial marriage ? &quot;
but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from nyu , have them go study for a semester at the university of arkansas , and vice versa . do it at the high school level .
we &apos;re losing a ritual .
such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of edinburgh , except in the botanical gardens .
this is a very famous painting : &quot; the doctor &quot; by luke fildes .
one had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer , had a small breast cancer detected -- had her lumpectomy in the town in which i lived .
i like to think that i do a thorough physical exam , but because the whole visit was now about the physical , i could do an extraordinarily thorough exam .
rituals are terribly important .
no , this ritual was about the one message that physicians have needed to convey to their patients .
dean ornish : the killer american diet that &apos;s sweeping the planet
we needed something that was portable , something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra-low-cost , compared to the 20,000 dollars that an incubator in the u.s. costs .
jane chen : a warm embrace that saves lives
and what you may not know about the history of the spca is , it was founded to kill dogs and cats .
and now we &apos;re in this new model of leadership , where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system , but by leading .
and , unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t work so well anymore either .
they &apos;ve got their own flag . they &apos;ve got the eye patches .
or from your book group . or from your friends , or from the circle you want .
zappos isn &apos;t a shoe store .
it &apos;s a story of a product that tells a story .
being a leader gives you charisma .
the sensor would have to be inexpensive , rapid , simple , sensitive , selective , and minimally invasive .
you start with some water , pour in some nanotubes , add antibodies , mix it up , take some paper , dip it , dry it , and you can detect cancer .
and so in the next two to five years , this sensor could potentially lift for pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal 5.5 percent to close to 100 percent , and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer .
where i work , in the arab region , people are busy taking up western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally western , nor are they traditionally islamic .
another character called jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions .
and when you love , how does it feel ?
because therein lies the mystery of eroticism .
it &apos;s when i &apos;m looking at my partner from a comfortable distance , where this person that is already so familiar , so known , is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious , somewhat elusive .
is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything ?
now , if you are dead inside , the other person can do a lot of things for valentine &apos;s .
it starts very young . it continues into our sex lives up to the end .
they know how to bring it back , and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it &apos;s just going to fall from heaven while you &apos;re folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has .
i &apos;ve played the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that .
this is a little bit later .
they had to be very quiet .
microphones enabled singers , in particular , and musicians and composers , to completely change the kind of music that they were writing .
the tempos are medium . it sounds big .
other birds , like this tanager , have adapted within the same species .
and i was so stimulated .
i have phlebitis at the moment , in both legs , and that &apos;s the reason that i had to have a little help in getting up here , because i have parkinson &apos;s disease in addition to that , and some other problems that i won &apos;t talk about .
and yet he says , &quot; he restores my soul . &quot;
and many of you , i &apos;m sure , have thought about that and puzzled over it .
i went to ambassador dobrynin , whom i knew very well .
unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us .
it &apos;s difficult for them to understand that they &apos;re going to die .
i &apos;ve done a lot of speaking in germany and in france , and in different parts of the world -- 105 countries it &apos;s been my privilege to speak in .
essentially , he said this : &quot; if you bet on god , and open yourself to his love , you lose nothing , even if you &apos;re wrong .
i couldn &apos;t prove it .
life is a right , not collateral or casual .
are you holding her ?
girl spoiled before ripened .
harvest bombs .
she thought he must just have been worn out by the work .
she argued and argued , and finally she struck lucky when a researcher came through town studying the history of mines in the area , and she told him her story , and at first , of course , like everyone , he didn &apos;t believe her , but he went back to seattle and he did his own research and he realized that she was right .
and when i duplicated the research in europe , asking all the same questions , i found exactly the same number .
ignorance is bliss , they say , but you can &apos;t put up with things like this . &quot;
i went to northern liberia .
till today , i have no idea where those two girls are .
in liberia , for example , the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls .
i wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop . &quot;
thank you .
and when the girls started engaging him , he was very hostile towards them .
but as we enter the era of big data , of network systems , of open platforms , and embedded technology , i &apos;d like to suggest it &apos;s time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time .
it places the names next to each other based on their relationships to one another : friends , families , coworkers .
and so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters , catching the cleverest is the difference between success and failure .
analyzing this data was hard . the originals were sheets of paper in arabic that had to be scanned and translated .
i &apos;d like all of you to pause for a moment , you wretched weaklings , and take stock of your miserable existence .
because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
we need to be realistic .
my wife , who is somewhere in the audience today , called me up at the office and said , &quot; nigel , you need to pick our youngest son &quot; -- harry -- &quot; up from school . &quot;
the area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city .
and we all pay dearly for solid waste costs , health problems associated with pollution and more odiously , the cost of imprisoning our young black and latino men , who possess untold amounts of untapped potential .
hunts point was formerly a walk-to-work community , but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to .
think bike shops , juice stands .
in the post-katrina era , we have still more in common .
so i don &apos;t have a problem with developers making money .
help me make green the new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
so three things have happened .
and i would like to show that against child survival .
and the bubbles keep moving up there , and this is what the world looks like today .
now we can take away this -- and i would like to show you the rate of speed , the rate of change , how fast they have gone .
i think it &apos;s the best way of verifying historical statistics .
the minister of the environment of india said , &quot; well , you were the one who caused the problem . &quot;
and the interesting thing , when you go around here in the photo panorama , you see the family still sitting on the floor there .
and this woman is very happy now , bringing her products to the market .
you make a powerpoint , you know ?
it &apos;s the best mean , but i give it zero as a goal .
and i &apos;m going to take this blade of steel , and push it down through my body of blood and flesh , and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible .
what do i mean by fluent ?
now , for some of you , when you hear about this , it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code .
so i &apos;m going to let all of you control this game using your voices .
he took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish .
coding can also enable you to express your ideas and feelings in your personal life .
cars are a sculpture -- did you know this ?
and it &apos;s not a whole lot different , really , when they &apos;re working like this , or when somebody works like this .
certainly we live in a competitive society .
i heard today about joseph &apos;s death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction .
now this is 24 / 7 living , half-a-dozen people who &apos;d left their -- some had left their wives behind and families behind , and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in america , but the first three months were the most intensive .
and here i &apos;m expecting at any moment , &quot; ok , they &apos;re going to turn the page , and i &apos;m going to see the cars , i &apos;m going to see the sketches , i &apos;m going to see maybe some idea of where it &apos;s going . &quot;
so i told them this story . i said , &quot; guys , i &apos;m thinking about something here , this isn &apos;t right . i can &apos;t have a relationship with you guys based on a premise that is a quantifiable one .
and we &apos;re able , finally , to answer the question that &apos;s been so pressing for so many years : why do i have cancer ?
it remembers that it &apos;s cancer .
and every nursing shift we would throw this material out .
you might know that fat has memory .
it &apos;s funded by foundations .
so we say the universe is expanding .
and it &apos;s basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don &apos;t notice , so that macroscopically it looks the same .
so that &apos;s our job .
there &apos;s a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon .
and then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will expand back .
and feynman also understood this .
so here &apos;s two questions for you .
this is a prediction . i might be wrong .
one year our fortune turned very bad .
using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo , i built my machine .
a gesture of &quot; namaste ! &quot; , maybe , to respect someone , or maybe -- in india i don &apos;t need to teach a kid that this means &quot; four runs &quot; in cricket .
so , these were some of the earlier explorations i did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly .
you can start painting on any wall .
but many of you argue , actually , that all of our work is not only about physical objects .
this is incredible , really .
at tedindia , pranav mistry demos several tools that help the physical world interact with the world of data -- including a deep look at his sixthsense device and a new , paradigm-shifting paper &quot; laptop . &quot; in an onstage q &amp; amp ; a , mistry says he &apos;ll open-source the software behind sixthsense , to open its possibilities to all .
it &apos;s a difficult task to deal with cities .
so how do you move these people around ?
so remember what i said : you don &apos;t always have to be rich or powerful to get things done .
bring infrastructure to the favelas , to the slums , wherever you are .
and i wanted to show that i can govern my city , using technology , from here , from long beach , so i got here last night and i know everything .
these are the cars .
i do the philosophy of art , aesthetics , actually , for a living .
i mean fossils , cave paintings and so forth .
consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure , the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes .
and some , in any event , are too big to use for butchery .
it &apos;s a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors .
ok ?
there is nobody we can &apos;t take down .
but it &apos;s not a perfect world , and your administration isn &apos;t getting us any closer . &quot;
they got out on the far end , we said , &quot; fine , don &apos;t worry about it . &quot;
they love to put them on trial . they &apos;ve got milosevic right now .
model on the imf .
ah !
can you come back next year and remind us again ? &quot;
our long-term rationale becomes , we &apos;re involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets .
that plus nukes rules out great power war .
and i &apos;m amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed .
inter agency-ize it , internationalize it .
armor goes this way .
this is about being up front with these guys and gals .
we have already an autonomous vehicle .
so we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle .
this simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces .
how are we going to issue driver &apos;s licenses ?
and the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything i did in the third person .
they told me , for example , that if i proved myself worthy of their help , then they could change my life back to how it had been , and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set , a kind of labor of hercules .
because i &apos;d had such a bad problem with self-injury that most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden , so i ended up arming myself with a plastic fork , kind of like picnic ware , and sort of sat outside the room clutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen .
you cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
it &apos;s the child that &apos;s remembered .
we don &apos;t know just how thick it is , probably miles thick , so it &apos;s very expensive and very difficult to go down there -- send down your submarine or whatever it is -- and explore .
otherwise , they would be at a temperature of minus 150 , which is certainly not favorable for developing life , at least of the kind we know .
so , the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps , and shine the headlights , and anything that doesn &apos;t look like a sheep , you shoot .
so they will , in fact , be quite easy for us to detect .
it was really a death trap . i mean , it was incredible , it worked incredibly well , but it was really dangerous .
this is a little piece of furniture for an italian manufacturer , and it ships completely flat , and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot .
but how we work on jawbone is really unique .
and then the other thing about this project is , we bring intellectual property , we bring a marketing approach , we bring all this stuff , but i think , at the end of the day , what we bring is these values , and these values create a soul for the companies we work with .
and we went away from obviously the beige .
so , i was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot , but i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s the etiquette here .
could we have people singing together in real time ?
or are they one and the same ?
women don &apos;t make those rules , but they define us , and they define our opportunities and our chances .
when i had to open the school in the refugee camp , i went to see the imam .
i also like rock and roll .
at the next friday sermon , the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs .
and the peace accord was signed .
they are saying , we don &apos;t have to be like you to make change .
i was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate , which is a conversation starter , let me tell you .
so how are we doing this in the lab ?
and i did that ; i put on my ritualistic dress ; i went to the holy mosque ; i observed all the rituals .
and actually this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon .
now these are things about general culture , but i &apos;m also very much interested in political culture and whether liberty and democracy is appreciated , or whether there &apos;s an authoritarian political culture in which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens .
there is no punishment on personal things like drinking .
so islamism is the problematic idea that really created a lot of problems in the 20th century islamic world .
in 1950 , turkey had the first free and fair elections , which ended the more autocratic secular regime , which was the beginning of turkey .
and i think the getaway message from that would be that islam , despite some of the skeptics in the west , has the potential in itself to create its own way to democracy , create its own way to liberalism , create its own way to freedom .
instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue , it somehow only stains about one percent of them .
you &apos;ve heard of ssris , which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases .
hundreds have been killed , and more than 100,000 displaced , including many ethnic uzbeks who fled to neighboring uzbekistan .
torture , rape and ethnic cleansing have become highly effective , if often non-lethal , weapons in civil war .
perhaps most importantly , local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise , not always fast and not always enthusiastically , but rise in the end they did .
good news is also about learning the right lesson .
civil wars and ethnic conflicts have brought the world incredible suffering , but stefan wolff &apos;s figures show that , in the last 20 years , their number has steadily decreased . he extracts critical lessons from northern ireland , liberia , timor and more to show that leadership , diplomacy and institutional design are our three most effective weapons in waging peace .
and where that energy touches water , something new emerges : life .
the fundamental forms of ferns followed , to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds .
extinction can come slowly , but sometimes it arrives fast .
and where it doesn &apos;t , as in greenland in winter , mars is still not very far .
so then there was a lot more beers , and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back .
so my lesson that year was persistence .
but he said , &quot; we will partner with you , but we &apos;re not going to invest in it . you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work . &quot;
we &apos;d had a great campaign , and to be honest , we &apos;d had our fair share of beer that night , but i said , &quot; you know what , i think we &apos;ve got one more bar left in us . &quot;
we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries .
benki knew this .
why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world ? &quot;
we have to change .
they have respite homes , the first , the first care centers , the first counseling services -- and not just in urban , 7-million-population bangalore , but in the hardest to reach villages in the state of karnataka .
but if you sat down and asked him , &quot; who are you really , and what do you do ? &quot;
they &apos;ve tried to connect worlds they didn &apos;t know existed before .
the two brothers one day decided to go on a race , three times around the world .
on the banks of a river called the indus , now in pakistan .
be spectacular ! -- like the greek heroes , like jason , who went across the sea with the argonauts and fetched the golden fleece .
it was called the vaitarani .
who knows ?
it &apos;s about conversation and faith .
i would give my viewpoints to people .
and you want god to see you , and hence the gods have very large eyes , large unblinking eyes , sometimes made of silver , so they look at you .
varuna has but a thousand eyes .
then , your other excuse is , &quot; yes , there are special people who pursue their passions , but they are geniuses .
you found something you &apos;re interested in .
yes he did .
course , i had to tell him that the building was for adults only and to get out .
but then you were born . &quot;
larry smith : why you will fail to have a great career
the pre-eminent mammographer in the united states issued the following quote to the washington post .
it &apos;s a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer .
he quotes one innovator who says , &quot; the only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick . &quot;
the duct tape is gone , and we added a second detector on top of the breast , which has further improved our tumor detection .
and her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue , but her mbi showed an area of worrisome uptake , which we can also see on a color image .
so until something is available for women with dense breasts , there are things that you should know to protect yourself .
deborah rhodes : a test that finds 3x more breast tumors , and why it &apos;s not available to you
when you come to my website , i actually know what you &apos;re going to do already because i &apos;ve seen you visit millions of websites before .
so to get people warmed up , let &apos;s start with an easy question -- something i &apos;m sure everybody here has an opinion about : iphone versus android .
but how do we figure out what &apos;s right and wrong ?
take a number , any number -- two .
aristotle said , &quot; we should seek only so much precision in each subject as that subject allows . &quot;
that has a very high utility to prevent that damage .
ethics is hard .
stop . good work .
now it &apos;s also a beautiful opera , and we &apos;re moved by that opera .
so anyway , even if i do not understand science entirely , for my design i essentially refer to it .
so when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter , preserved from noise pollution .
and this object will be able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day , and able to give you the quantity of light you need .
so i turned traditional pills into this .
in this guise of living object approach , i like the idea of a kind of invisible design , as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves .
a very natural technology , in order to say to the miners , &quot; the air is too bad . you have to go . it &apos;s an emergency . &quot;
but here , unlike andrea , here are supposed to be eaten .
your seat , your sleep and your play on a big geodesic island made of leather .
secondly , i want to tell you how somebody like me came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang .
and for the worse -- not for the better , but for the worse .
and he took one look at sudhir , who was going to go do some surveys for him , and decided he knew exactly the place to send him -- which was to one of the toughest , most notorious housing projects .
but ultimately , the story has a happy ending for sudhir , who became one of the most respected sociologists in the country .
so in some sense , the foot soldiers are a lot like the people who are taking your order at mcdonald &apos;s .
so , with shooting at you , what are the death rates ?
and then all of my friends said : &quot; maybe i should go do that , too . &quot;
it &apos;s why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks , ok ?
and it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of &apos; weak and shit &apos; could really be important . &quot;
base jumping is skydiving from fixed objects , like buildings , antennae , bridges and earth -- meaning mountains , cliffs .
enjoy , and thank you very much .
because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards .
i am saying something . and your eyes and your brain are saying something back .
how do we reconfigure it ?
these kinds of experiments , they filter into architectural models .
so this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space .
having an experience is taking part in the world .
so i set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean , and i had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made .
how could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now ?
bringing them to life , bringing them to light .
at the time , he was teaching classics at trinity college in dublin .
this is a dolphin that is self-aware .
they are very different from us in body form .
on a good day , it &apos;s music , and i want to talk a little bit about the most amazing music-making experience i ever had .
i lost it when i saw that clip .
please go ahead .
you &apos;ve been using the experimental version for the last 30 years .
now , there is a project that &apos;s underway called the interplanetary internet .
so there &apos;s a lot of back-end signal processing , not for one to many , but for many to many .
so i went to sleep , and that was it for me .
i mean , so many pictures , so i asked friends to come , graphic designers most of them , to make posters with me , because i didn &apos;t have the time .
something crazy also happened .
and we &apos;re understanding . and you show compassion .
so to me , this is the courageous thing to do , to try to reach the other side before it &apos;s too late , because when it &apos;s going to be too late , it &apos;s going to be too late .
recently , obama has introduced optimism at a sort of time of global financial crisis .
in fact he looked like a building we had designed for a hotel in the north of sweden .
we also asked ourselves , what could denmark possibly show china that would be relevant ?
one of the first projects we ever did was the harbor bath in copenhagen , sort of continuing the public realm into the water .
and then at 11 o &apos;clock they stopped talking about these little issues .
and the facade of the parking , we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated , so we needed to perforate it .
we always argue a lot about the soundtrack , but in this case it was really easy to choose the song .
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
because we can &apos;t solve problems .
so what i &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices .
and of course , i &apos;m very happy you asked that question -- -- because that &apos;s a very good question .
what they basically show us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
it might even cost up towards a percentage point of gdp every year for affected nations .
what this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities .
we have , you know , &quot; the day after tomorrow &quot; -- it looks great , right ?
they had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
my studio in bali was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest , and monkeys , of course , are supposed to be the happiest of all animals .
we live where we want to be -- at least in the west .
this is a bus , or vehicle , for a charity , for an ngo that wants to double the education budget in the united states -- carefully designed , so , by two inches , it still clears highway overpasses .
and along with that , some acetic acid .
and as it evaporates , it will knit itself together , forming seams .
and in fact , we could make it from a waste stream -- so for example , a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant .
we must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways .
karl marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism , the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor .
her parents , who are both farmers , looked on , speechless .
very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be .
if you spend enough time , it &apos;s upward , and i met people who had moved to the city 10 years ago , and who are now basically urban middle class people , so the trajectory is definitely upward .
they ask us to use them only against the infidels .
that &apos;s why pakistani civilians , over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone , are fair game .
sharmeen obaid-chinoy : inside a school for suicide bombers
you can experience their sense of place .
this was the internet , this black box with a red light on it , as represented in the sitcom &quot; the it crowd . &quot;
now there are six cables and more coming , three down each coast .
it starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing .
many barriers are breaking down .
it is great .
if we slice into this product which is actually sitting here , you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it , which means it &apos;s a more efficient product .
you can use software like google sketchup to create products from scratch very easily .
and you can start iterating the design .
it &apos;s very intricate .
and so the thousands of young muslim men who flocked to afghanistan in the 1980s to fight against the soviet occupation of a muslim country , in their minds they were fighting a jihad , they were doing jihad , and they named themselves the mujahideen , which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad .
that was the power of that word that he was able to do .
i was in yemen recently , where -- it &apos;s the home of the last al qaeda franchise that still aspires to attack america , attack the west .
9 / 11 didn &apos;t empower him ; it doomed him .
but in all the many years that i have covered the middle east , i have never been as optimistic as i am today that the gap between the muslim world and the west is narrowing fast , and one of the many reasons for my optimism is that , because i know there are millions , hundreds of millions of people , muslims like that old imam in tunis , who are reclaiming this word and restoring to its original , beautiful purpose .
it was also the day after the inauguration , and i was reminded how mathare is still connected to the globe .
and i reflected , as i was watching her sell the dresses , and also the jewelry that she makes , that now jane makes more than four dollars a day .
but maybe me , i give out something better because i give them hope . &quot;
have you ever wanted to write a novel ?
there was gas rationing in 1973 .
i started an educational software company after i joined lotus , and then i started idealab so i could have a roof under which i could build multiple companies in succession then , much much later -- in 2000 , very recently -- the new california energy crisis -- or what was purported to be a big energy crisis -- was coming .
so , that &apos;s a breakthrough .
so , even this , although it was great with no moving parts -- we could achieve high temperatures -- wasn &apos;t enough .
but after the stirling engine , otto came along , and also , he didn &apos;t invent the internal combustion engine , he just refined it .
that &apos;s basically the most fundamental heat engine you could possibly have .
it &apos;s just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the linkage and it &apos;s the hot cap -- the hot cylinder on the top -- this part gets hot , this part is cool , and electricity comes out .
the hot water &apos;s optional .
but if you don &apos;t have grid-supplied electricity , then the whole question of payback is a different one entirely .
it &apos;s been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it .
we blow it up and look at the pieces .
it &apos;s a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i kept writing bad poetry , and he didn &apos;t blow up the math building , but he went to cuba .
but i have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and i have a gorgeous onion from murray gell-mann &apos;s talk .
i was fortunate also , to meet the man who &apos;s sitting on the bed , though i gave him hair over here and he doesn &apos;t have hair .
do you mind my asking a question ? &quot;
and then he died , and there was no more spinoza . extinct .
well , not so awful .
ok . i taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about 85 .
maira kalman : the illustrated woman
but nevertheless , there &apos;s no real sense of separation from me in my heart , in terms of the love that i feel for these people .
so i think that , in this way , it &apos;s always possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better .
so , where are the robots ?
it has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way it &apos;s tilting .
hod lipson : building &quot; self-aware &quot; robots
the virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years to form two distinct families , if you will , of the h5n1 viral tree with branches in them , and with different attributes that are worrying .
we have seen human-to-human transmission in at least three clusters -- fortunately involving very intimate contact , still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk .
most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called tamiflu , which may or may not be helpful -- i &apos;ll get into that -- of available vaccines , and any other treatments , and masks , and anything that &apos;s been stockpiled .
your insurance payments didn &apos;t go through .
we &apos;ve stockpiled enough for 30 percent .
and that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people before we had commercial air travel .
but can you sustain your company that way ?
we have absolutely no idea what that would do .
audience member : one of the things i &apos;ve heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia , and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival .
so we built something .
last year , i created a one-man show .
you cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing .
he said , &quot; philippe , you have been had .
but nobody wanted to hire me .
so after the walk people ask me , &quot; how can you top that ? &quot;
i mean , a bird needs space to fly .
now the dove , who , now you know , obviously cannot fly , does for the third time a little flop , flop , flop and ends up on the wire behind me .
thank you .
these plants occur in great diversity , over 28,000 species around the world .
scenes of forest destruction , forest harvesting and forest fragmentation , thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has when it is not disturbed by humans .
they danced in the forest , and we are taking this dance , my scientific outreach communications , and also linking up with environmental groups , to go to different cities and to perform the science , the dance and the environmental outreach that we hope will make a difference .
they were very enthusiastic .
when we come to understand nature , we are touching the most deep , the most important parts of our self .
but it ended up in this very long , protracted legal battle and there i was after five years fighting against parliament in front of three of britain &apos;s most eminent high court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not parliament had to release this data .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re starting to see more disclosure laws come out , so for example , on the environment , there &apos;s the aarhus convention , which is a european directive that gives people a very strong right to know , so if your water company is dumping water into your river , sewage water into your river , you have a right to know about it .
so when the guardian did this investigation about the afghan war , you know , they can &apos;t walk into the department of defense and ask for all the information .
so what is the solution ? it is , i believe , to embody within the rule of law rights to information .
but the world isn &apos;t a fairy tale , and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge .
but , the point is that scuba divers generally stay less than 100 feet deep , and very rarely go much below this , at least , not with any kind of sanity .
there &apos;re three basic limitations of scuba diving .
this picture was taken 300 feet deep , catching new species of fish .
so that &apos;s the breathing loop in a nutshell .
and i can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but i want to move on to something that &apos;s kind of much more interesting .
now little fishes and invertebrates aren &apos;t the only things we see down there .
now , i don &apos;t know if any of you get u.s. news and world report -- i got the recent issue .
when we first found it , we weren &apos;t even sure what family this thing belonged to , so we just called it the dr. seuss fish , because it looked like something out of one of those books .
he had made a very simple mistake .
and it was while i was doing my ph.d .
when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin &apos;s brain , the results were startling .
one thing i wanted to say about film making is -- about this film -- in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we &apos;ve heard here , michael moschen , and some of the talks about music , this idea that there is a narrative line , and that music exists in time .
he died in 1974 .
nk : you &apos;re proud of it ?
but he was also human .
perspectives can change .
our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy , and we know that many other stars have planetary systems .
it tells us about their past , but detection of a signal tells us it &apos;s possible for us to have a long future .
so this &quot; ascent &quot; of man , pinnacle of evolution , has got to go .
this is a very good year .
we &apos;ve seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands .
their entire camp , every item of gear , was ferried 885 miles from mcmurdo station , the main u.s. supply base on the coast of antarctica .
from this , we can detect an extraordinary number of things .
the 109th air national guard flew the most recent shipment of ice back to the coast of antarctica , where it was boarded onto a freighter , shipped across the tropics to california , unloaded , put on a truck , driven across the desert to the national ice core laboratory in denver , colorado , where , as we speak , scientists are now slicing this material up for samples , for analysis , to be distributed to the laboratories around the country and in europe .
around 1850 , one of the biggest u.s. industries was whaling .
it could well be enough to double the oil price , for example .
and in the upper left , a pioneering effort 14 years ago by gm -- 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid , in a four-seater .
here &apos;s a handmade mclaren slr carbon car that got t-boned by a golf .
now , when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil , including buildings , industry , feedstocks and so on , you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025 , well , about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then , with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over , at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel , instead of 26 for buying the oil .
it turns out that if , say , african-american and white households had the same car ownership , it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities .
they would have been gone if we &apos;d kept that up one more year .
so , contrary to popular belief , there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values .
so , we &apos;re real , and we &apos;ve touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls .
girl 8 : well , sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on because i have music lessons and i &apos;m on swim team -- all this different stuff that i have to do , and sometimes it gets overwhelming .
i could get invited to that party any day if i wanted to .
goering was hitler &apos;s second in command in world war ii , his designated successor .
there &apos;s a lot more to be said about van meegeren , but i want to turn now to goering , who &apos;s pictured here being interrogated at nuremberg .
i want to suggest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we react to things .
or take sex .
as a third example , consider consumer products .
so let &apos;s go back to art .
i &apos;ve been focusing now on the visual arts , but i want to give two examples from music .
and they gave them a series of painful electric shocks .
it has this bizarre , ongoing philosophical project of dividing all the inanimate objects in the world into the ones that either cause or prevent cancer .
she is our tv diet guru .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat veg and olive oil have fewer skin wrinkles .
the kids got the pills , and then their performance improved .
but that &apos;s not the only way you can rig your data .
this is something called funnel plot .
if we remove half of the data , we can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is .
and i tell them , &quot; it &apos;s the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don &apos;t see . &quot;
nothing . they don &apos;t talk about us . they don &apos;t talk about the coal .
you want a better life for yourself .
and you feel something about this .
there &apos;s something else about them that you see -- they don &apos;t see themselves .
man , the americans , they &apos;re just like , &quot; ah , crusade .
and they take these little kids and they run them through these things till they teach them how to say , &quot; sir , yes , sir , &quot; and things like grenade toss and weapons care and maintenance .
you have it wrong . you &apos;ve missed it .
now , put yourself in the shoes , go back to the shoes of an arab muslim living in iraq .
you see , that &apos;s empathy .
by leading the americans in his audience step by step through the thought process , sociologist sam richards sets an extraordinary challenge : can they understand -- not approve of , but understand -- the motivations of an iraqi insurgent ? and by extension , can anyone truly understand and empathize with another ? &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
china is the world &apos;s greatest anti-poverty program over the last three decades .
and to explain why this is so , i have a question .
how else can we create new ideas ?
1996 : less than one million new university students in china per year ; 2006 : over five million .
now let &apos;s imagine that you were an economist in 1929 , trying to forecast future growth for the united states , not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff , not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century .
but jefferson wasn &apos;t quite right , was he ?
in fact , we live on a mostly unexplored planet .
and that may be just the beginning !
the human juggernaut is permanently eroding earth &apos;s ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym &quot; hippo , &quot; the animal hippo .
and let us call it the &quot; encyclopedia of life . &quot;
this had been the most abundant bird in the world that &apos;d been in north america for six million years .
this was an animal that basically kept the forest mixed with grasslands across the entire europe and asian continent , from spain to korea .
it &apos;s called an allele .
so they hosted and funded this meeting . and 35 scientists , they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists , basically meeting to see if they had work to do together .
he then has a way to put the germ plasm into the embryo of a chicken egg so that that chicken will have , basically , the gonads of a falcon .
that technology will be used on de-extincted animals .
as that data matures , they &apos;ll send it to george church , who will work his magic , get passenger pigeon dna out of that .
throughout humankind &apos;s history , we &apos;ve driven species after species extinct : the passenger pigeon , the eastern cougar , the dodo ... but now , says stewart brand , we have the technology to bring back species that humanity wiped out . so -- should we ? which ones ? he asks a big question whose answer is closer than you may think .
and afterwards , we all went back to our classrooms and we drew our own renditions of his main character , rotten ralph .
i had art .
&quot; you &apos;re really good . you know , the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist , and you should be the cartoonist .
and i didn &apos;t understand . he said , &quot; you have a great style .
now , i used to work the weekends at the hole in the wall off-season programming to make some extra money as i was trying to get my feet off the ground , and this kid who was just this really hyper kid , i started calling him &quot; monkey boy , &quot; and i went home and wrote a book called &quot; good night , monkey boy . &quot;
i have 10 picture books out .
they use these to design with and they design for them , which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this — — and sound like this , shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion , or why we get on airplanes -- -- which cost 200 million pounds , with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system , making us jump out of our skins .
this is an area i intend to take on this year .
now that &apos;s not just deaf children . that could be any child who &apos;s got a cold , glue ear , an ear infection , even hay fever . on a given day , one in eight children fall into that group , on any given day .
we have urban planners .
i love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen .
thank you .
it &apos;s as though you made something resonate within them .
charlie chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music , silence , humor and poetry .
and in these years , i met all kinds people like , for instance , farmers and butchers , which seems logical .
and then in paintbrushes , hairs are used because , apparently , they &apos;re very suitable for making paintbrushes because of their hard-wearing nature .
it &apos;s actually a very low-tech and very high-tech product at the same time .
we know why kids don &apos;t learn .
i &apos;d taught the whole lesson wrong .
i put a &quot; + 2 &quot; on his paper and a big smiley face .
and while you won &apos;t like them all , the key is , they can never , ever know it .
and i &apos;m going to say a few words about each one this morning .
the solution is that these constructions , despite initial appearance , are not synonymous , that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition , you see that there &apos;s a subtle difference in meaning between them .
it evokes the container metaphor of communication , in which we conceive of ideas as objects , sentences as containers , and communication as a kind of sending .
and likewise , if someone says , &quot; nice store you &apos;ve got there . it would be a real shame if something happened to it &quot; -- -- we understand that as a veiled threat , rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities .
the simplest example of this is in the polite request .
in an exclusive preview of his book &amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; the stuff of thought &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ; , steven pinker looks at language and how it expresses what goes on in our minds -- and how the words we choose communicate much more than we realize .
this is learning something , learning an idea , from an organism and then applying it .
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world -- that &apos;s the switch .
how does life make the most of things ?
imagine spraying the precursors to a pv cell , to a solar cell , onto a roof , and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light .
which is an amazing fossil fuel savings , if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing .
timed degradation : packaging that is good until you don &apos;t want it to be good anymore , and dissolves on cue .
and yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year .
and we don &apos;t invest in what &apos;s invisible to us .
and that was actually an excellent business , because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood .
they want to move from micro to medium and beyond .
because -- and i say this as somebody who worked in finance -- 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade .
and she told me , &quot; never import other people &apos;s limitations . &quot;
because in its 400 years of existence , storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device .
and they remembered a man , one amazing german , every time a new storytelling device popped up next .
and now all bets are off .
and then you get to the finishes , the subject of all of those &quot; go green &quot; articles , and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all .
we gotta kill them because they &apos;re making a mess .
and not surprisingly , given the human population growth , more than half of the human population is living in cities now .
there are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have .
they &apos;ve learned from their peers . they &apos;ve learned from their enemies .
the crows learn that all they have to do is show up , wait for the coin to come out , put the coin in the slot , and then they get their peanut .
hacker and writer joshua klein is fascinated by crows . after a long amateur study of corvid behavior , he &apos;s come up with an elegant thought experiment : a machine that could form a new bond between animal and human .
and so suddenly they &apos;re looking at me .
you know , most actors want to do characters that are likeable -- well , not always , but the notion , especially at a conference like this , i like to inspire people .
and so he put her in the bathtub , and i was in the bedroom with the baby .
&quot; and then we got the baby and my other child , and we drove out to , like , i-95 .
i never saw any poor man , any black .
igniting , igniting , igniting fire . igniting fire .
but determination , you know , it &apos;s like just , you know , &apos; fuck the form , get the horn . &apos; that &apos;s tuff hedeman , in the movie &apos; 8 seconds . &apos; i mean , like , pat o &apos;mealey always said when i was a boy , he say , &apos; you know , you got more try than any kid i ever seen . &apos; and try and determination is the same thing .
so let me share with you some empirical data from my lab .
&quot; my grandfather worked at this factory .
in fact , i was in china to see what they were doing , and they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that i was with , and i was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations and standing next to one of the chinese officials , and we were watching , and he says , &quot; so , gov , when do you think the u.s. is going to get national energy policy ? &quot;
and it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy .
it &apos;s old-school demographics .
that &apos;s easier for them to find out than who you are .
why should i know this ?
i &apos;ll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is .
it &apos;s a very strange world inside a nanotube .
bear in mind this was an ultrasound , so it would have been moving images .
it was remarkable . it took about one minute .
i said , &quot; you should actually do this . &quot;
i loved this guy . i got a lot of mileage out of theodoor van de velde .
sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective at head-banging their way into the egg .
why don &apos;t you have the farmers do that ?
that is what they would do . pretty amazing .
on the night of june 11th , 2003 , he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the manhattan bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below .
i know that seems ludicrous .
pull the knot .
so i decided to give him a little support , and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other .
and yeah , it &apos;s the sort of thing you produce when you &apos;re doodling on the phone .
i think it doesn &apos;t matter .
and you know , there you had this little sign -- i put this little sign outside the door every morning that read , &quot; please tidy room . &quot; i don &apos;t know if you have them over here .
and then i -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up .
i am no designer , nope , no way .
all of us ? designers ?
nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago , my six-year-old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that i had , and they said , &quot; oh , dad ! dad ! look , you gotta get these , these flashy wheels -- you gotta get &apos; em ! &quot;
someone making the experience their own .
let me tell you , some of you may have the experience .
we &apos;re five now . five .
gods we &apos;re still fighting about . oh yeah .
i wish i could show you that contraption .
and i went , &quot; oh my god .
my head snapped back over my red seat .
a friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories mirrored my own , each centering on a life that had changed in an instant , owing , if not to a crash , then to an inheritance , a swing of the bat , a click of the shutter , an arrest .
the frequent furl of five fingers , the chips in my teeth come from biting at all the many things a solitary hand cannot open .
it was then that abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone 16 years before .
&quot; strange , &quot; i said .
with a nod to jewish custom , he told me that i should live to be 120 years old .
thank you .
and this is really heavily backlit .
and we &apos;re getting this mass-manufactured .
so now , several hundred of these walking meetings later , i &apos;ve learned a few things .
the obvious question here is , does a tedtalk really need 2,300 words ?
so i thought of a different way by thinking , well , the talks revolve around certain themes .
again , there were some misunderstandings .
but barring such an anomalous upbringing , it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours , most with fundamentally different features , that would rightly be called universes of their own .
how ? well according to einstein &apos;s math , if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy , sort of like a uniform , invisible mist , then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive , repulsive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observations .
but there &apos;s a cost to this elegant unification , because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work .
which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now measured would take on a wholly different character .
so we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life .
because the theory predicts that the big bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded , tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world , yielding a distinctive fingerprint , a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots , across space , which powerful telescopes have now observed .
are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion ?
there are no controllers , no keyboards , or mice , or joysticks , or joypads .
it never works .
okay , this is skimming stones .
it &apos;s all been too much for him .
that means milo &apos;s mind , as millions of people use it , will get smarter and cleverer .
the siege went on for three and a half years , and it was a siege without water , without power , without electricity , without heat , without food , in the middle of europe , in the middle of the 20th century .
between april and august , 1994 , one million people were slaughtered .
and there , sadly , will always be wars .
so we got a little snippet of a thought , and we could see it in front of us .
so even before a target appears that she &apos;s supposed to cross with the cursor that she &apos;s controlling with this joystick , aurora is trying to find the target , no matter where it is .
and you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them , or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first-person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar &apos;s arms or legs .
the brain is assimilating that too , as fast as we can measure .
and i was five years old , and i never understood why nasa didn &apos;t hire captain kirk and spock to do the job ; after all , they were very proficient -- but just seeing that as a kid made me believe , as my grandmother used to tell me , that &quot; impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true . &quot;
this is what happens to girls in remote areas .
and that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity .
from one to five , girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate than boys , in all of india .
so what would some of the specific challenges look like ?
so that meant she was incontinent ; she couldn &apos;t control her wastes .
well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in-law told her son , &quot; i think you &apos;d better get a second wife .
the twins started producing milk .
you learn from your mistakes , and you continuously improve .
sheryl wudunn : our century &apos;s greatest injustice
why wouldn &apos;t they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts that somebody else had already cracked open for them ?
and as a result , our ideas do accumulate , and our technology progresses .
so if we &apos;d chosen that path , our evolutionary path would have led into the forest -- and been a short one indeed .
and this is why our species has prospered around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind bars in zoos , languishing .
and this is also true of some remote oceanic islands .
and that question is whether in this modern , globalized world we can really afford to have all these different languages .
biologist mark pagel shares an intriguing theory about why humans evolved our complex system of language . he suggests that language is a piece of &quot; social technology &quot; that allowed early human tribes to access a powerful new tool : cooperation .
cheap meaning a few percent of gdp .
the result of that was pretty dramatic .
this topic is also old .
so it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere , about 100 kilometers up , that already have this effect .
maybe another knob is a knob for controlling co2 concentrations .
i &apos;ll tell you how big the lever is : the lever is that big .
and that &apos;s one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about , and , in general , i think it &apos;s the underlying reason that it &apos;s been politically unacceptable to talk about this .
it involves a campaign of letter writing , research and phone calls to access my subjects , which can range from hamas leaders in gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in west virginia .
but in this context i &apos;m just going to read an abridged version of those texts .
these are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the atlantic ocean , connecting north america to europe .
in the context of &quot; star wars : return of the jedi , &quot; its mirror image is presented .
for the men in these photographs , the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification .
he ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery .
now , there was nothing particularly special about 2010 , because , on average , 31 and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year .
the doors can actually swap out , so you can actually put on a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control , or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together , which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces , so now this same kit of parts , this same unit can actually serve as a living room , bedroom or bathroom , or an office , a living space and secure storage .
michael mcdaniel designed housing for disaster relief zones -- inexpensive , easy to transport , even beautiful – but found that no one was willing to build it . persistent and obsessed , he decided to go it alone . at tedxaustin , mcdaniel show us his exo reaction housing solution and shares how he &apos;s dedicating his free time to working with suppliers and manufacturers to prepare for the next natural disaster . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
here we have the mars science laboratory on its way to mars , just launched last weekend .
i &apos;m going to pull out , and i want to show you voyager 1 as it flies by saturn .
man wishes to be happy , only wishes to be happy , and cannot wish not to be so .
so the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy was really what freud called ordinary misery .
and that isn &apos;t true -- when you get less miserable , you get less miserable .
we have basically at least two systems here , and they both are very ancient .
our pleasures are really ancient .
romantic attraction , that gets into the desire system .
maslow had this idea back in the 1950s that as people rise above their biological needs , as the world becomes safer and we don &apos;t have to worry about basic needs being met -- our biological system , whatever motivates us , is being satisfied -- we can rise above them , to think beyond ourselves toward self-actualization or transcendence , and rise above the materialist .
africa was truly fascinating for me .
now why would you use rats ?
but with this small investment in a rat capacity , we have demonstrated in mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter , we do it at $ 1.18 , and we can still bring that price down .
here it &apos;s already at the third sample .
to conclude , i would actually like to say , you may think this is about rats , these projects , but in the end it is about people .
now , one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy , in parma , by giacomo rizzolatti and his colleagues , is a group of neurons called mirror neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes .
even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago , 100,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly .
in other words , you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
hp : yr : if i may , i would like to tell you a little bit about myself and my artwork .
i have been wondering recently , if he were alive today , what advice he would give me about making this ted talk .
he then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct , and that i had learned it very well , but in a woman &apos;s voice .
and it isn &apos;t just bright flowers that have pollen ; it &apos;s also trees and grasses .
remember , that thing is just about 30 micrometers across .
now , much of the pollen will still be there after repeated washings .
since 1984 , more women die in the u.s. than men .
betty ford , nancy reagan stood up and said , &quot; i &apos;m a breast cancer survivor , &quot; and it was okay to talk about it .
and she started , in the face of a lot of controversy , the women &apos;s health initiative .
some women have those heart attacks , but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack , where it erodes , doesn &apos;t completely fill with clot , symptoms are subtle , ekg findings are different -- female-pattern .
so we are working now on a non-invasive -- again , these are all invasive studies .
and that is female-pattern and why we think the yentl syndrome actually is explaining a lot of these gaps .
so this is where we are , but we have a long row to hoe .
good morning everybody .
so this brings me to lesson number one : life can do a lot with very little .
tissue engineer and fellow nina tandon is growing artificial hearts and bones . to do that , she needs new ways of caring for artificially grown cells -- techniques she &apos;s developed by the simple but powerful method of copying their natural environments .
so with that technology and that data and the ability to , with machine assistance , transcribe speech , we &apos;ve now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts .
and the implications of this -- there are many , but one i just want to point out , is that there must be amazing feedback loops .
he &apos;s leaving red ink behind .
so we &apos;re pulling in about three billion comments a month , and then the magic happens .
another example -- very different -- another actual person in our database -- and we &apos;re finding at least hundreds , if not thousands , of these .
it &apos;s a cluttered environment ; it &apos;s natural life .
and this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning , the better we can communicate , and , i also think , the better we can think and collaborate together .
it &apos;s the kind of gut center , where you see an image and you go , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever i &apos;m seeing . &quot;
what we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall .
this is the first house i built .
after all , it &apos;s not just a question of hygiene , but there &apos;s a possibility of recreation as well .
so don &apos;t put it there .
let &apos;s take it out . throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in . &quot;
apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste .
he said , &quot; no , no . i &apos;m not paying you to go through the trash . get back to work . &quot;
it &apos;s gone now . &quot;
napkin in my lap , half bites , chew with my mouth closed , no scratching .
right there is reason enough to have uniforms .
we &apos;re in trouble .
now comas are measured on a scale from 15 down to three .
while i was producing in los angeles , i never thought about it for a second .
and that then might lead you to watch an episode one day of cedars-sinai medical center and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind .
i thought there were miraculous elements , but i also didn &apos;t think it was right that one should have to struggle and search for answers when this is a pandemic within our society .
now the journal of the national medical association gave my memoir a full clinical review , which is very unusual .
that &apos;s why the same between the before and after that this shows , it &apos;s hard to see the difference .
where does it go inside the body ?
and so i was sitting in this restaurant , waiting for a man to come by who obviously would have some difficulty ...
and it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation .
and i put them together , so that in each pair of country , one has twice the child mortality of the other . and this means that it &apos;s much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data .
or have they got longer lives and live up there ?
and they are over here on this side . quite an overlap between africa and oecd .
there is an uncertainty margin , but we can see the difference here : cambodia , singapore . the differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data . east europe : soviet economy for a long time , but they come out after 10 years very , very differently . and there is latin america .
we find that students get very excited when they can use this .
we will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways .
and , you know , i wrote a book . so i &apos;ll say something -- -- i &apos;ll say a little about , you know , how the discovery was made , and why francis and i found it .
and it was at indiana i got the impression that , you know , the gene was likely to be dna .
and certainly , neither crick or i were chemists , so we tried to build a model . and he knew , francis knew wilkins .
and i read it , and it was just -- it was crap .
so i changed the locations , and then we found the base pairing , and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions .
george gamow , also a great physicist , he designed the tie .
and you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions .
and so , i &apos;ll conclude by saying we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
so case closed , right ?
now how did that happen ?
the hi-tech industry would like stronger protections for producers .
as long as they have infrastructure , mentorship and resources , they can build what they need , not only to survive , but to thrive .
he contacted me immediately and said , whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside , his doors are always open .
because a father is locked in does not mean he should be locked out of his daughter &apos;s life .
it was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s .
it &apos;s just happening in another part of the world .
it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we &apos;ve had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it &apos;s exposed to too much heat , and we can tell that it &apos;s not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it &apos;s not potent ; it &apos;s not going to protect them .
within a couple of years , every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses , with the exception of four countries that you see here .
umar is seven years old , and he &apos;s from northern nigeria .
and this started an incredible collaboration with industry , and within six months , we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted , just two years ago , the last two types of polio in the world .
now we &apos;re in tough times economically .
b it &apos;s interesting .
bj : well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her -- in fact , more time than even her mother did .
we don &apos;t always get that right , and on this particular day , we seriously underestimated the depth .
and i have to tell you that it was a disturbing night for me .
so dereck turned on the heater fan in the car -- very innovative .
we had to deal with these individual personalities .
a new male comes into the area and takes over the pride , and , of course , first of all kills all the cubs and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs .
richard feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories -- experimental predictions -- to specifying the width of north america to within one hair &apos;s breadth of accuracy .
why , then , do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable ?
steve grand -- he &apos;s the one on the left , douglas adams is on the right -- steve grand , in his book , &quot; creation : life and how to make it , &quot; is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself .
a flying animal needs a different kind of model from a walking , climbing or swimming animal .
because there are so many of them , and because there &apos;s no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement , the marble , as we see it in middle world , stays rock steady .
what we say -- and i include the most austerely mechanistic among us , which is probably me -- what we say is , &quot; vile monster , prison is too good for you . &quot;
i married my high school sweetheart , jane .
by the way , check out my sweet ride .
and our hope is that , by providing these tools , that you &apos;ll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled , to provide care for our aging population , to help better educate our children , to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future , to both monitor and protect our environment , and to explore the universe .
then bringing us into the present day is a fellow collaborator of mine and cymatics expert , john stewart reed .
and here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish .
their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience , change became not only possible , but inevitable .
and it &apos;s terribly endangered .
and you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that twitter is in fact a very heavily brazilian space .
it &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
when you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks , you get a very different picture .
when you look at the new york times , you look at other elite media , what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations and the nations we &apos;ve invaded .
nor do i think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
there &apos;s a group right now in china called yeeyan .
and in that sense of trying to get you out of your normal orbit , and to try to get you to pay attention to a story about someone who &apos;s given up smoking for the month of ramadan , she has to know something about a global audience .
but the trick with bridges is , ultimately , you need someone to cross them .
and we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles .
do we find a flourishing civil society , a vigorous rule of law and good security ? no . what we find in afghanistan is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt , a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective , a media which is beginning to get onto its feet but a government that &apos;s deeply unpopular , perceived as being deeply corrupt , and security in pakistan , in lots of sub-saharan africa , again you can see democracy and elections are compatible with corrupt governments , with states that are unstable and dangerous .
the point about democracy is intrinsic .
the public is losing faith in democracy , says british mp rory stewart . iraq and afghanistan &apos;s new democracies are deeply corrupt ; meanwhile , 84 percent of people in britain say politics is broken . in this important talk , stewart sounds a call to action to rebuild democracy , starting with recognizing why democracy is important -- not as a tool , but as an ideal .
if you see them side by side , there &apos;s yellow and brown .
and i went looking for chicken .
now back then , the americans were not clamoring to eat chinese food .
there is italian chinese food , where they don &apos;t have fortune cookies , so they serve fried gelato .
it wasn &apos;t that .
but that dish also took about 10 years to spread across america from a random restaurant in new york city .
finally , in about the sixteenth century , a physician whose name was theophrastus bombastus aureolus von hohenheim , called paracelsus , a name probably familiar to some people here -- -- good , old paracelsus found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion .
and to their amazement , after it was over , he began speaking like he was perfectly well .
it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english , no one could read or write english .
and they tried everything they had .
well , he said , &quot; can &apos;t we try a course of electroshock therapy ? &quot;
every time i would begin thinking obsessionally -- again , once more , after 20 shock treatments -- i would say , &quot; ah , fuck it . &quot;
it &apos;s known by some people in new haven , obviously , but it is not generally known .
but we don &apos;t necessarily have the means to do so .
and that was the 1950s .
and yet , when the situation changes , you suddenly hear politicians talking as if , you know , for example , the life of one american soldier is worth countless numbers of iraqi civilians .
even if , as a human being , you believe that , you can &apos;t say that . you &apos;re elected for britain &apos;s interests .
china and india have signed up to the scientific evidence .
prime minister , i think there are many in the audience who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into .
the silk worm does a remarkable thing : it uses these two ingredients , protein and water , that are in its gland , to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection -- so comparable to technical fibers like kevlar .
so once you have these attributes of this material , then you can do a lot of things .
i mean , why would you want to do all these things for real ?
and so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have , that they &apos;re programmably degradable .
now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes .
&quot; that &apos;s terrible , &quot; said the patient .
any of you like television ? audience : yes .
my phrase for this value of being with &quot; not like us &quot; is &quot; strangeness , &quot; and my point is that in today &apos;s digitally intensive world , strangers are quite frankly not the point .
my colleagues and i at intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives , what kinds of new routines are possible .
how might we think differently about our relations with technologies , things that effectively become social participants in their own right ?
i was in high school and got a bad grade , a rare event for me , so i decided to hide it from my parents .
my father , a secret agent ?
well , they were out , but they were always in danger . the big &quot; jew &quot; stamp was still on their papers .
he had made a simple calculation : in one hour he could make 30 forged documents .
then as time passed , at the end of almost two years , they thought , &quot; well , perhaps our father has died . &quot;
and those heroes did not need an army behind them .
we &apos;ve had the same , roughly , abilities that developed civilizations as we know it .
simultaneously , they branch off in the mid-50s , 10 years after the second world war , showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid-50s .
and this is the new paradigm , which we gathered two , three years back , recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future , aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts , is of the past .
now the question then is : how gloomy is this ?
we need nothing less than a new green revolution , and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink .
johan rockstrom : let the environment guide our development
and they also decided that i had to -- to give me a very ugly plexiglas trophy for it .
unfortunately , it has become obsolete because it was designed for atari platform .
and you become trapped into this kind of representation .
&quot; valicia . &quot;
also , the reference to gerhard richter &apos;s use of color charts -- and the idea also entering another realm of representation that &apos;s very common to us today , which is the bit map .
see , i think it &apos;s not really about impression , making people fall for a really perfect illusion , as much as it is to make -- i usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion .
so what has now happened in the last few years is that there are account technologies around that allow you to see many , many pieces of dna very quickly .
and we can begin to say how much variance do we find , how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences .
what happened to the neanderthals ?
so having now a neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at ancient remains and extract the dna , we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world .
we learn perhaps many things , but one thing that i find sort of important to mention is that i think the lesson is that we have always mixed .
these are survival skills that we inherited over many , many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution .
this is our body wisdom . it &apos;s not something that is mediated by our language . our body just knows that , and we &apos;ve known that for a long time .
there are millions of individuals with autism all around us .
well , it &apos;s hard to do that , so we had to create the technologies . we had to basically step inside a body .
it &apos;s almost as if that stimulus , you , you &apos;re not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives .
early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder can improve the lives of everyone affected , but the complex network of causes make it incredibly difficult to predict . at tedxpeachtree , ami klin describes a new early detection method that uses eye-tracking technologies to gauge babies &apos; social engagement skills and reliably measure their risk of developing autism . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
if you &apos;re an outboard personnel , now you stand up .
you are going to hit the ground .
and i also was raised with personal examples of leadership .
i &apos;ve got to use video teleconferences , i &apos;ve got to use chat , i &apos;ve got to use email , i &apos;ve got to use phone calls -- i &apos;ve got to use everything i can , not just for communication , but for leadership .
and yet , we need to have that shared sense .
and every morning in the ranger regiment , every ranger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them -- says a six-stanza ranger creed .
thank you .
the point of that for me was to say -- in that space , in that moment -- that i really , more than anything , wanted to understand how images could work , how images did work , and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives to work through these images .
to this end , the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions , all titled with an f -- freestyle , frequency and flow -- which have set out to discover and define the young , black artists working in this moment who i feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years .
what do i think about when i think about art ?
the truth is , we can build a better world , and we can do so right now .
you may already know some of the big-picture aspects : globally , more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera , and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens , and over the network -- and sometimes enter history books .
in the best worldchanging tradition , it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas , successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility .
developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps , from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu .
on top of that , those are the places from where trouble comes .
two months later -- and this is now documented in the information technology for international development journal -- that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral british accent in which i had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer .
as a result , the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their english -- rapid improvement and all sorts of things .
so i said , &quot; for two months , you were looking at stuff you didn &apos;t understand ? &quot;
approximately 5,000 miles from delhi is the little town of gateshead .
because their teachers say that after the session is over , the children continue to google further .
this is a sole in newcastle .
self-organizing systems also always show emergence , which is that the system starts to do things , which it was never designed for .
no one was there , and they came out , and they did this incredible dance .
the circle . the circle . it &apos;s so obvious .
it &apos;s a movie . i did &quot; the tempest &quot; on a stage three times in the theater since 1984 , &apos; 86 , and i love the play .
and our little life is rounded with a sleep .
i prefer you to see people moving , and you &apos;re going , &quot; whoa , what was that ? &quot;
i know you &apos;ve all been there .
so how do we do that ?
so what we did is we took a data system which we run every two weeks of the year in formula 1 and we installed it on the hospital computers at birmingham children &apos;s hospital .
with wireless connectivity these days , there is no reason why patients , doctors and nurses always have to be in the same place at the same time .
and with that confidence surge , i thought , &quot; well , it &apos;s time to create a real bakery , so let &apos;s paint it . &quot; and the women said , &quot; that &apos;s a really great idea . &quot;
i think andrew pretty well covered that , so i will move to the third point , which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty .
they buy it , they dry it and they bring it to this factory , which was purchased in part by , again , patient capital from novartis , who has a real interest in getting the powder so that they can make coartem .
and so , anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in africa to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment to work with malaria .
we &apos;ve got to start having conversations like this , and i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any better way to start than using the market , but also to bring other people to the table around it .
this is the opening frame of the video that we created .
we used all of that , including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through .
and we learned that small stuff stinks .
months were spent in this tiny , cold warehouse .
unfortunately , at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking , because we had to go much deeper in , and so the research came to a halt , and it was only taken up in 2000 thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the guinness family .
they &apos;re magnificent . you see leonardo at work .
and they &apos;re scientific models ?
it would be like having a clinical trial on a chip .
it gives new meaning to models against animal testing , doesn &apos;t it ?
and then , the size of the earth . somehow making these all compatible with the earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with .
they are powered only by the energy they can extract from the atmosphere -- an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy .
pm : but now we &apos;re trying to get the video . there we go .
but like any basic research , when you &apos;re really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology , you can get there with micro-technology , nanotechnology .
and if this lands on you , i assure you it will not hurt you .
but i stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host , not as a comedian , but as someone who was , is , and always will be a mathematician .
today we &apos;re going to talk about prime numbers .
- 1 = 2,047 , and you don &apos;t need me to tell you that &apos;s 23 x 89 .
frank nelson cole did not stop there .
and then curtis cooper got it back .
this number is 17 and a half thousand slides long , and we know it is prime as confidently as we know the number seven is prime .
i was asked in an interview last year in my capacity as a lower-case &quot; c &quot; celebrity in australia , &quot; what was your highlight of 2012 ? &quot;
thank you .
these tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors , such as these ones here .
and when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells , if one of them acquires new mutations , which allow them to grow more quickly , acquire nutrients more successfully , invade the body , they &apos;ll be selected for by evolution .
think about that for a minute .
in fact , genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old , which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the neanderthals .
it &apos;s a cognitive illusion that we &apos;ve been studying in my lab for the past few years , and 80 percent of us have it .
now i &apos;m a scientist , i do experiments .
i think the logic goes something like this : if we don &apos;t expect greatness , if we don &apos;t expect to find love and be healthy and successful , well we &apos;re not going to be disappointed when these things don &apos;t happen .
but if you get the kiss in three days , well that &apos;s three days of jittery anticipation , the thrill of the wait .
if we expect the future to be bright , stress and anxiety are reduced .
what i wanted to know was what was going on inside the human brain that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally .
then we interfered with the brain region that we found to integrate good news in this task , and the optimism bias disappeared .
because if you &apos;re one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly , you certainly never will .
now that &apos;s a big abstract number .
so let me step back and ask : what &apos;s power ?
but in fact , what we &apos;ve seen is none of those were true .
indeed , one of the advantages that the americans will have in terms of power in asia is all those countries want an american insurance policy against the rise of china .
and if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective , we &apos;re going to be able to manage this process .
all this still persists .
and then the second step is to say , &quot; the situation is admittedly dangerous , but only for a short time . &quot;
you can only get positive , that mental shift , if the reality is that prosperity is being built .
and there are two key things it &apos;s got to do .
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navigate by needs you get a very unfocused agenda , because in these situations , needs are everywhere , but the capacity to implement change is very limited .
there &apos;s one sector which isn &apos;t exposed to international trade , and which can generate a lot of jobs , and which is , in any case , a sensible sector to expand , post-conflict , and that is the construction sector .
and so what i &apos;d suggest is what i call independent service authorities .
paddy ashdown , who was the grand high nabob of bosnia to the united nations , in his book about his experience , he said , &quot; i realize what i needed was accountants without borders , to follow that money . &quot;
this talk is about being prepared for , and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home , the earth .
but as important as technology and infrastructure are , perhaps the human element is even more critical .
airports around the world are located on the coast .
it &apos;s up to us to look at our homes and our communities , our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk , and to find ways to not just survive , but to thrive , and it &apos;s up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same , even while they address the underlying causes of climate change .
t : i don &apos;t want to let myself down .
jw : so is english mania good or bad ?
she &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
and i said , &quot; what do i do ? &quot;
and they weren &apos;t flashing in anger , they were flashing in love , intense love for her students .
i was creating a lesson for students on africa .
there &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
it &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
and we were very upset .
i &apos;ll show you what my friend david says about this .
and we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut-off time -- there was about a minute left -- and despair just settled over the room .
and they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
i joined telco , made tata trucks , pretty close to pune .
this square might look very square and prim .
i was a 24-year-old young engineer .
many of our folk toys have great science principles .
as a matter of fact , feynman , as a child , was very fascinated by this .
you can see a gleam in their eye .
and this is wool over here .
and they &apos;d be absolutely joyous playing with this .
it &apos;s been catapulted to international glory .
so these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver .
so with such large , lightweight pillows , we had much less steel .
and just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time , there &apos;s a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing .
so when the moist breeze blows in off the sea , you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle &apos;s shell .
so our energy problems are not intractable .
and there &apos;s just about every element of the periodic table in seawater .
i turned to my grandmother , who always had plenty of advice , and she said , &quot; stop being so picky .
now , i like the idea of online dating , because it &apos;s predicated on an algorithm , and that &apos;s really just a simple way of saying i &apos;ve got a problem , i &apos;m going to use some data , run it through a system and get to a solution .
and we went in , and right off the bat , our conversation really wasn &apos;t taking flight , but he was ordering a lot of food .
do you like horror films or romance films ?
he likes to travel as long as it doesn &apos;t involve a cruise ship .
what i was trying to get at here was that i figured in person , i would be just as competitive as a smileygirl1978 .
i &apos;m telling them about this fabulous news , and they say , &quot; this is wonderful !
i &apos;m a brain scientist , and as a brain scientist , i &apos;m actually interested in how the brain learns , and i &apos;m especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter , better and faster .
that &apos;s a statement about vision .
&#91; &quot; blue &quot; &#93; db : yellow .
a bit more challenging , right ?
i showed that to you already , like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time , those action gamers have a lot of very good vision , etc .
they don &apos;t play 10 hours of action games in a row .
then , i started drilling down , thinking about the computations i might want to do , trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from and how they could be automated as much as possible .
it &apos;s not at all what we &apos;re used to , and i must say that , when i first saw this , it came as a huge shock to my intuition .
let &apos;s start off with something really easy .
but that &apos;s just the beginning .
if you go on , that &apos;s a slightly more complicated program that &apos;s now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on .
something like rule 30 , for example , turns out to be a really good randomness generator .
not an easy project .
benoit has been particularly interested in nested patterns , in fractals and so on , where the structure is something that &apos;s kind of tree-like , and where there &apos;s sort of a big branch that makes little branches and even smaller branches and so on .
we all know about the miracle of miniaturization .
and you know what &apos;s cool ? i &apos;m actually one of them .
teachers looked nice .
there was a woman sitting in the middle of it , and this woman was waiting to hold us .
this gentleman , he helped me .
i found snow !
why can &apos;t they build a school for boys , and i &apos;ll build a school for girls ? &quot;
one hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams .
i &apos;m calling this the great unwind .
it shows leverage , trended out from 1919 to 2009 .
guns , gun sales , according to the fbi , who does background checks , are up almost 25 percent since january .
this is a story on the yacht club that &apos;s all basically blue collar .
so , what we see with empathy and respect , lots of really hopeful things that have come out of this recession .
we also see a big diy movement .
everything about locally derived products and services , supporting your local neighborhoods , whether it &apos;s cheeses , wines and other products .
or you look at johnson &amp; amp ; johnson &apos;s momversations .
i &apos;m fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility , so i get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction .
i get the same bike back , and they &apos;ve taken all the little warps out of those same wheels i &apos;ve had for two and a half years , and my bike is like new .
now in the early 1970s , in ankara , that was a bit unusual .
ironically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today &apos;s globalized world .
the child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
i love writing in turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and i love writing in english , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
we often talk about how stories change the world , but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated , read and reviewed .
some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the turkish-armenian conflict .
if it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
as long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity .
henry ford once said , &quot; i invented nothing new .
now , back in the &apos; 80s , there were no software patents , and it was xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface .
our creativity comes from without , not from within .
and you say then , &quot; ok , then how do you know your home address ? &quot;
but i think to set the scene , to show the worst ted slide in the history of ted , but it is a bit of a mess .
so , tiny moon .
we think it &apos;s saltwater , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that moon of jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the earth combined .
what you &apos;re seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn &apos;t just glow like a white light , it just emits light at particular colors , a red one , a light blue one , some dark blue ones .
what happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the edge of that mass ?
so , i think science can be -- serendipity is important .
on it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was lived out their lives .
but just as the internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us , it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world .
now like most of you , i actually start my day going online and checking email .
imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement .
imagine if you were quiet for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
my dad said , &quot; why didn &apos;t you do that when you were 16 ? &quot;
and i decided that i was going to go to school . so i did .
so i did that .
and so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren &apos;t learning you probably weren &apos;t teaching very well .
my dad said , &quot; that &apos;s one , &quot; and i still didn &apos;t let that go .
there i am , walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says , &quot; pasaporte , pasaporte , &quot; and with an m16 pointed at me .
but i know i needed to .
how did i do this ?
well , i said as a joke in a production meeting -- and this is a true story , by the way — i said , &quot; why don &apos;t we turn this guy into a hologram ?
but who on earth would be interested by seven not-yet-built musical instruments inspired by women &apos;s bodies ?
so this is what happened on this movie , and that &apos;s how it got made , and we went to this very nice postproduction company in montreal called vision globale , and they lent their 60 artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film .
i have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
chinese soldiers will catch and send back north koreans , where they face severe punishment .
and during dinner , i wanted to have one more wing , but i realized there were not enough for everyone , so i decided against it .
this is my message to you .
joseph kim : the family i lost in north korea . and the family i gained .
thank you . i had one big problem .
it just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
so we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
mr. berlusconi brought g8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and i got half a million euros from the japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
shigeru ban : emergency shelters made from paper
but the pregnant woman &apos;s own voice reverberates through her body , reaching the fetus much more readily .
six months later , the women &apos;s infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice , and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it .
in the autumn of 1944 , the darkest days of world war ii , german troops blockaded western holland , turning away all shipments of food .
this story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems -- an adaptation to prevailing circumstances that facilitates its future survival .
that important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they spend in the womb .
we are all very good at suspending our disbelief .
but when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected , we laugh .
marco tempest : a magical tale
you may remember this as the aol-time warner merger , okay , heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time .
it was simply to encourage the inoculation of children by , not only making it a social event -- i think good use of behavioral economics in that , if you turn up with several other mothers to have your child inoculated , your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone .
so these questions ... what is happening in the world is the big stuff , actually , is done magnificently well .
but what is happening is that effectively -- and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn &apos;t helped this ; lots of things haven &apos;t helped this -- business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy .
that &apos;s why i call for the &quot; chief detail officer . &quot;
and this is essential to the progress of science , or exploration of what is possible .
but you get about 80 percent of the way there , for about one percent of the cost .
i was six years old when i first heard stories about the poor .
i started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth , because i wasn &apos;t doing more , apparently , to make things better .
but more importantly , he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories i had heard before .
in fact , no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all .
it &apos;s about retelling the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity , validates a partnership relationship , not a relationship that &apos;s based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen .
this continued attention -- this ongoing attention -- is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us .
so they can be a cash , or a cause , investor .
jessica jackley : poverty , money -- and love
under extreme conditions , general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space .
if we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy , we should make sure we survive and continue .
in keeping with the theme of ted2008 , professor stephen hawking asks some big questions about our universe -- how did the universe begin ? how did life begin ? are we alone ? -- and discusses how we might go about answering them .
well , i work at the seti institute .
this is something that we &apos;re using today to search for e.t. , and the electronics have gotten very much better too .
so in fact , this is a pretty accurate estimate of the number of planets in our galaxy , just in our galaxy , by the way , and i remind the non-astronomy majors among you that our galaxy is only one of 100 billion that we can see with our telescopes .
but what about you ? what &apos;s it going to do to you ?
and they &apos;re just doing it because they want to explore , and you might say , &quot; oh , that &apos;s kind of a frivolous opportunity , &quot; but that &apos;s not frivolous . that &apos;s not a frivolous activity , because , i mean , think of ants .
and in fact , here &apos;s an example : the higgs boson , finding the higgs boson .
so , all right , i give talks to adults , that &apos;s fine , but i try and make 10 percent of the talks that i give , i try and make those for kids .
these are some kids from the huff school , fourth graders .
here &apos;s an octopus moving across the reef , finds a spot to settle down , curls up and then disappears into the background .
the best thing to do is to get as big as i can get . &quot;
so here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue .
so i &apos;m looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true , blue perspective for this beautiful planet .
it &apos;s an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis .
what i find so exciting is that the census of marine life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators ; it &apos;s also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column , where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found .
that is , we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone , but we need to scale these up , we need to build their capacity , so they &apos;re like the southern ocean , where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization .
nothing comes easily . but i have a lot of fun . &quot;
persist ! joe kraus says , &quot; persistence is the number one reason for our success . &quot;
adam ostrow : hello .
now in closing , i think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality -- and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
and importantly , it &apos;s a rich source of vitamin b12 .
now i &apos;m an economist , i &apos;m not a doctor , but i see the god complex around me all the time in my fellow economists .
in about the length of this session , you would have counted all 5,000 .
i realize that &apos;s an ambiguous statement .
you take a nozzle and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle .
obviously experimentation is very important .
they had the god complex in spades .
it feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law .
it &apos;s full of us , it &apos;s full of our stuff , full of our waste , full of our demands .
come on , you &apos;re thinking .
but the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong , and it &apos;s dangerously wrong , because it means we &apos;re not getting ready for what &apos;s really going to happen .
we see the occupy protests , we see spiraling debt crises , we see growing inequality , we see money &apos;s influence on politics , we see resource constraint , food and oil prices .
maybe fear .
i wanted to know what that would take , so i worked with professor jorgen randers from norway to find the answer .
we can choose life over fear .
quite the contrary .
it has to be one of the multiple ironies of history that a favorite expletive of muslim fundamentalists is the same one once used by the christian fundamentalists known as crusaders : &quot; infidel , &quot; from the latin for &quot; faithless . &quot;
and i , for one , refuse to live that way .
so what i &apos;m going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes is i &apos;m going to talk first about the flames -- where we are in the economy -- and then i &apos;m going to take three trends that have taken place at ted over the last 25 years and that will take place in this conference and i will try and bring them together .
and we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids , but , guess what ?
everything else is mandated .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in .
this should not surprise you , right ?
third trend : robots .
and as you bring these trends together , and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf , who can now begin to hear -- i mean , remember the evolution of hearing aids , right ?
and then you created earth about 4.5 billion years ago , and then you got life about four billion years ago , and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago , and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago .
and although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly , almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end .
and he decided that maybe he should leave the country for a few days , and seek out some more intelligent , open-minded people in a place called oxford , and come and try and tell the story at that place .
and what you find is that the car seats and the lap-and-shoulder belts , when it comes to saving lives , fatalities look exactly identical .
these are the crash test dummies , waiting for their chance to take the center stage .
i would like you to approve it for selling , &quot; then they would say , &quot; this is a fantastic new car seat , it works great .
and i think the answer , perhaps , lies in a story .
but it &apos;s obviously a critical question .
and so i began to think about that .
so to a first approximation , we have these things -- twenty petahertz synapse firings .
and everything will go through the web .
attention is the currency .
we &apos;re now entering to the third stage , which is what i &apos;m talking about , and that is where we link the data .
and all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages , they are things .
it will know us , and that &apos;s good .
what i didn &apos;t know though , was most of those people , standing there with me , were moonies .
women gave poison to their babies , and watched foam come from their mouths as they died .
and the thing is , though , if you looked at my brain during those years in the moonies -- neuroscience is expanding exponentially , as ray kurzweil said yesterday . science is expanding .
it &apos;s calvino &apos;s idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line , not the straight line .
and of course , today , with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping , etc . , we have the mechanisms to understand and to respond to these systems , and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities because that &apos;s all we do .
and the idea was the relationship of the space , which was made up of the fold of the image , and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration , and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space , which were in dialog .
well , that immediately turned into something much broader , and as a scope .
this is the first sketch of a high school in pomona -- well , whatever it is , a model , a conceptual , kind of idea .
the new capital competition for berlin , four years ago .
and we spent some time with conan , believe it or not , and then that led us to , kind of , the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic , architectural .
it &apos;s for cooked food .
why is it always do and don &apos;ts and it &apos;s good for you , it &apos;s not good for you ?
umami -- this is a meaty taste .
and within this structure , you see these two pinkish layers , which are actually the muscle .
the big brain integrates signals , which come from the running programs of the lower brain , but subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower .
it &apos;s very difficult to work in the intestine .
he said , &quot; you know , clearly at some point , we were all of an animal nature , and at some point , we weren &apos;t . &quot;
i recently sailed on the hokulea , named after the sacred star of hawaii , throughout the south pacific to make a film about the navigators .
and the fourth and most important , of course , was the delineation of a contemplative practice that not only had the possibility of a transformation of the human heart , but had 2,500 years of empirical evidence that such a transformation was a certainty .
and then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses .
so , literally two weeks ago , i returned from having spent six weeks with the elder brothers on what was clearly the most extraordinary trip of my life .
and this is one of those initiates .
a people who find a way , with their imagination , to carve life out of that very frozen .
in every case , these are dynamic , living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces .
you &apos;ll find it inside of you .
but these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts , not petroleum .
so my team has taken five days-worth of growth , a typical growth cycle for us , and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse .
and i think that can be some really good news .
for example , if you shine light through a superfluid , it is able to slow photons down to 60 kilometers per hour .
for example , at the university of minnesota , there &apos;s a biomedical engineer named david odde , and he works with dancers to study how cells move .
the artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed .
but i want to tell you something useful -- and here it is , so concentrate now .
well , her colleague suddenly got much more interested than i had any right to expect and went on and said , &quot; what does he model ? &quot;
and you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears and you average them . ok ?
there are two ways of thinking about this .
it &apos;s a very , very simple example , an easily stated question in probability , which every -- you &apos;re in good company -- everybody gets wrong .
to try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases .
and in fact , if this is the prevalence of the disease , about 100 will have the disease and the rest won &apos;t .
to be put through the stress of the trial , convicted of murdering them -- and to spend time in a women &apos;s prison , where all the other prisoners think you killed your children -- is a really awful thing to happen to someone .
it &apos;s exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that after the disease test , which is 99 percent accurate , the chance of having the disease is 99 percent .
well , we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance are very much a part of our everyday life .
and just to finish in the context of the legal system .
so we considered all of this . and we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself .
thank you .
it &apos;s not only to defend the chinese regime from overseas , from the universal values , but also to prevent china &apos;s own citizens to access the global free internet , and even separate themselves into blocks , not united .
he wanted to prevent the netizens &#91; from criticizing &#93; him .
but that is the ministry &apos;s data . he shows 50 .
for example , they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard .
but you can &apos;t even expand more , no , because chinese sina weibo , when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of twitter.com .
so chinese in china , censorship is normal .
thank you .
as a musician , i can tell you that if i had to have a cochlear implant , i &apos;d be heartbroken . i &apos;d just be plainly heartbroken , because i know that music would never sound the same to me .
but here is that same girl who is implanted now .
however , despite this incredible facility that some cochlear implant users display with language , you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can &apos;t hear music almost at all .
go ahead and play this one .
i had patients tell me that those sound the same .
joseph : i was born in 1986 .
but i tell you , if we lost our hearing , if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing , you would want perfect hearing back .
i chose the gun .
my father was a hardworking baker , but when he had finished work in the bakery , he often told me and my brother stories .
they liberated my birth town .
secondly , the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further .
ladies and gentlemen , looking at this gun , we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind .
raise your right hand . ok . how many of you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about ? raise your left hand .
so you get 250 of these in the mail in little tubes .
this is a friction climb , up in tuolumne meadows , in the yosemite high country .
you &apos;ve got to keep going .
we &apos;ve heard a lot about the promise of technology , and the peril .
and if you ask me , will the price of google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now , that &apos;s very hard to say .
so the first step in biological evolution , the evolution of dna -- actually it was rna came first -- took billions of years , but then evolution used that information-processing backbone to bring on the next stage .
every time one paradigm ran out of steam , another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth .
you add other forms of innovation and processor design , you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year .
we were evolved in an era where it wasn &apos;t in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference , like myself , to live much longer , because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them .
what you &apos;re watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell , and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub-optimal , even though it &apos;s remarkable in its intricacy .
e-commerce has been growing exponentially . it &apos;s now a trillion dollars .
you can go there with other people , have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses .
this particular one that was given to me finds golf balls , especially if you &apos;re at a golf course and you check under enough bushes .
i call this process &quot; patternicity &quot; -- that is , the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise .
so for example , what do you see here ?
in other words , the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there &apos;s a lack of control .
and if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists , they go away .
and what pattern do you see here ?
but even when i take it away , the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns .
and i call this process agenticity .
nineteen members of al queda plotting to fly planes into buildings constitutes a conspiracy .
you wouldn &apos;t ? you &apos;d think that was fine .
so , according to dung beetles , dung is pretty good .
it was that every now and then they &apos;d climb on top of the ball and they &apos;d take a look at the world around them .
so what are they doing when they do this dance ?
watch how often the beetle dances .
on the way home , he knows where home is , and he wants to go straight to it .
so what have we learned from these animals with a brain that &apos;s the size of a grain of rice ?
it shows very well that eyes can hear , and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound , such as the removal of time .
i &apos;m going to wave through the kinect here and take control , and now i &apos;m going to reach out and i &apos;m going to touch a star , and when i do , it will play the sentence that generated that star .
designer jared ficklin creates wild visualizations that let us see music , using color and even fire to analyze how sound makes us feel . he takes a brief digression to analyze the sound of a skatepark -- and how audio can clue us in to developing creativity .
we eat and make money to be able to enjoy life .
i can try to tell you what it was like , but you &apos;ll never know what it was like , and the more i try to explain that i felt lonely , i was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles , it was cold , nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day , the more words fall short , and i &apos;m unable to do it justice .
it will take us about four months to make this return journey .
you can &apos;t just walk up and say , you know , &quot; hi , i &apos;m a really good guy , and a good girl , and you should really invest in me . &quot; right ?
and now along with that , along with the experience of starting an enterprise , or running something -- and it doesn &apos;t have to be a business .
because bad things happen .
you &apos;ve got maybe 10 seconds -- between 10 and 30 seconds , depending on how long the pitch is -- to get their attention .
it &apos;s got to be upside , and it &apos;s got to be believable .
what do you think ?
so with that said , we only have a very , very short time .
and i want to know if you have any relationships that are going to be special to help you .
i hope you invested personally .
if you use apple &apos;s keynote , it &apos;s got an even better version in keynote .
and i wondered if i could update that game , not just for modern methods , but for the modern me .
i didn &apos;t know it .
like my next link : the chemical language of pheromones .
i click on chimpanzee , and i get our closest genetic relative .
this is the kind of fact i would have loved as a boy .
and worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , the economist .
how did this happen ?
it &apos;s a serious gene .
but no , now our meme goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
maybe you didn &apos;t know that .
we dance , we kiss , we sing , we just goof around .
we have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
what happens ? they give better service -- not worse , but better .
well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the rankings for best employer for small business .
you know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven forbid .
so i understand that this meeting was planned , and the slogan was from was to still .
the industrial design magazine , i believe , is called &quot; innovation . &quot;
and then finally it was prepared for the throwing .
and the first day , i was coming to take my place at the turntable -- there were three or four turntables -- and one of them , behind where i was sitting , was a hunchback , a deaf-mute hunchback , who smelled very bad .
and they invited myself to come to the russian factory last summer , in july , to make some dishes , design some dishes .
&quot; sputnik &quot; was downtown , the negative . it wasn &apos;t touched .
that &apos;s my father &apos;s letter to me , telling me to marry the woman i first married when i was 20 .
you follow instructions on nerve and you should end up on babble , which we did .
av : we , or i ?
and i think i &apos;m speaking obviously here to the father &apos;s experience .
and i called my sister whom i &apos;m very close to -- and had three children -- and i asked her , &quot; why didn &apos;t you tell me i was going to be feeling this way , that i was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated ? &quot;
people i interacted with daily , worked with , was friends with , family members that i had known a long time , had never shared with me their own stories .
it can &apos;t possibly be that bad .
in fact , when we first went out to raise money to start babble , the venture capitalists said , &quot; we categorically don &apos;t invest in companies founded by husbands and wives , because there &apos;s an extra point of failure .
and it turns out the further back you go in history , the little rougher it sounds .
in fact , the theme isn &apos;t even the melody , it &apos;s the bass line .
and so on the same disk we have five recordings -- sony has five recordings .
and nimoy , i &apos;m sorry , spock sits down at the piano , and he starts playing this brahms waltz , and they all dance to it .
it was a concert he recorded in the shrine auditorium in 1949 .
what i &apos;m going to try and do is to give some pointers to what i think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis , what things we should be looking out for and how we can actually use the crisis .
we &apos;re now at another moment when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market .
and , after all this , as the great chinese sage lao tzu said , &quot; governing a great country is like cooking a small fish .
and he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists .
nothing like the resources of a cern or a darpa or an ibm or a dupont .
it will be worse at the end of this year , quite possibly worse in a year &apos;s time than it is today .
now , how might that be ? let me give you an example .
for example , most other germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying , &quot; morgen regnet es , &quot; quite literally to an english ear , &quot; it rain tomorrow . &quot;
let me show you how far you can do that .
it &apos;s getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions , but one of whom speaks flemish and one of whom speaks french ; or two families that live in a rural district in nigeria , one of whom speaks hausa and one of whom speaks igbo .
&quot; here on holiday are you , dear ? &quot;
and of course , the u.k. benefited from some of that lovely oil wealth .
it &apos;s all in english . &quot;
it brings to mind a headline i saw recently : &quot; education : the great divide . &quot;
when he received his award , he said these lovely words : &quot; the children can lead africa from what it is today , a dark continent , to a light continent . &quot;
we didn &apos;t -- a lot of flying , a lot of experiments , a lot of things that didn &apos;t work , and ones that did work , and the plane kept getting a little better , a little better .
the green line goes down . that &apos;s the wild nature portion .
as time went on , we stopped our environmental programs .
that plane is widely used by the military , now , in all their operations .
and that &apos;s it , so you can just control it , wherever you want , and it &apos;s just hours of fun . and these are no longer in production , so you have real collector &apos;s items .
he is a very good colleague of einstein &apos;s , we must say .
and where it &apos;s landing to bring the twigs to the cliff , its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in . there was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds .
so he thought , &quot; i will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh , then clean the dog &apos;s wounds , and then i &apos;ll figure out what to do with the maggots . &quot;
so , naturally , they chased him out of town .
so , that &apos;s the way the buddhists do it .
you can feel the familiarity of all beings .
they would be relaxing somewhere having a good time .
but the next step is called &quot; universal responsibility . &quot;
and let me just read it , the important details here : &quot; shorthand description , &#91; &apos; hardcore pornography &apos; &#93; ; and perhaps i could never succeed in intelligibly defining it .
and that &apos;s a simple question .
it is a system , like traffic , which has components .
and i &apos;m going to use as an example the internet , because it &apos;s a particularly good example of stacked simplicity .
with integrated circuits , you can build cellphones .
and then i would propose as this last component that they serve , or have the potential to serve , as building blocks .
so , let me close -- let me close with my two aphorisms .
you &apos;ve got a company set up to ...
special people , special places , think up special ideas , then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers , who are passive .
the truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative ; like wikipedia , it develops over a long period of time .
why , we found , people were interested in this , is that at work they don &apos;t feel very expressed .
i &apos;ve invented this brilliant new program that is much , much better than microsoft outlook . &quot;
i think the idea of creating the red cross for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea , but can we really organize that , just on volunteers ?
and it creates a kind of stickiness between the community and the company which is really , really powerful .
isn &apos;t it amazing ?
i &apos;m about to whip somebody &apos;s ass oh , i &apos;m about to whip somebody &apos;s ass oh , if you don &apos;t leave me alone , you gonna have to send me home &apos; cause i &apos;m about to whip somebody &apos;s ass now you might not be able to sing that out loud , but you can hum it to yourself , and you know what the words are .
i heard you were looking for me . &quot;
&quot; our conversation started with me saying , &apos; i &apos;m bored , &apos; and her replying , &apos; when i &apos;m bored i eat pretzels . &apos; i remember this distinctly because it came up a lot . &quot;
and so some really nice things came together .
and i said , &quot; oh yeah , i &apos;ll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep . &quot;
and so what i decided to do .
when i get the brains i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m looking at .
and i &apos;d given this one talk in israel , just this past year .
and that book is very interesting . because it &apos;s about witch trials , and how people thought back then .
what we do is we accelerate protons -- so , hydrogen nuclei -- around 99.999999 percent the speed of light .
now you might say , &quot; well , ok , but why not just look at it ?
so , this thing was discovered in the year 2000 , so it &apos;s a relatively recent picture .
so those ws there refer to the ws , and how they stick together .
and that &apos;s exactly the way the higgs mechanism works .
many other things that the lhc could discover .
absolutely remarkable .
the researchers found that the span of a player &apos;s smile could actually predict the span of his life .
please , don &apos;t try this at home .
rather , it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget i had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something .
so we noticed change .
the reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole , and , on the other hand , a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe .
it &apos;s not just about politicians and laws .
but haiti provided us with something else unprecedented .
but does it work ?
you can find out about the health centers .
they &apos;re normally backroom or basement hardware service providers , but they need to be elevated to software strategists .
even in the rain , people stood between madison and 5th avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street .
it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time , and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world , and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers .
like it . find other books exactly like his .
and even here , when i look at the great bear , i get back that feeling of being a child , hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder , and i can get back that feeling of being a child again .
we &apos;ve seen again and again just how creative technology can be , and in our lives and in our actions , we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it .
my mother was english .
it takes her one year , through refugee camp after refugee camp , to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country .
and a lot of rituals involved killing , killing little animals , progressing along , so when i turned 13 -- and , i mean , it made sense , it was an agrarian community , somebody had to kill the animals , there was no whole foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at -- so when i turned 13 , it was my turn now to kill a goat .
and my mother said , &quot; don &apos;t talk about that in front of guests . &quot;
they killed him .
thank you .
and life starts to expand and expand and expand , until it goes kaput .
and as you &apos;re thinking about this , you might also ask the question : so why a single human species ?
we &apos;re going to know at year end if that is true .
but it &apos;s really hard , once you ski down , to get back up .
and as you think about it , let me close with an example of the brain .
the third , is this too much information ?
the robot i &apos;m holding in my hand is this one , and it &apos;s been created by two students , alex and daniel .
so this should be clear in these videos .
and so what the robot does is it plans what we call a minimum snap trajectory .
and so here we looked to nature .
so again , these robots come really close together .
it figures out where it is with respect to the features and then estimates its position 100 times a second allowing us to use the control algorithms that i described to you earlier .
and let me start by telling you , i gotcha .
what &apos;s it gonna look like ? we have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss . we have more and more people , billions of people , in 100 years , god knows how many people , and how little space there will be to fit all of them , so we need to change the way that we see cities , and looking at this picture on the left of new york city today , you can see how gray and brown it is .
with the trains coming in to urban hubs , they can carry pollen with them , very light pollen , and it &apos;s just a big supermarket in the city .
humans think about our own health in a prospective way .
their clients aren &apos;t happy , and people go hungry .
and that is bread -- something which is as simple as our basic , most fundamental human staple .
why do we feel that this is more true than this ?
but it has changed the world .
and that &apos;s not only true in this country , it is true all over the world .
i would love to go back to tuscany to this kind of traditional setting , gastronomy , good food .
you cannot ask people to work under these conditions .
and we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small-scale and large-scale .
understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events .
so enjoy your bread .
so as is the case with simple solutions , oftentimes the answer is right in front of your face , and for us it was levers .
and the final point i want to make is that i think this project worked well because we engaged all the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider in bringing the technology from inception of an idea through innovation , validation , commercialization and dissemination , and that cycle has to start and end with end users .
it &apos;s not only because we like to drink lots of it , and its marvelous derivatives , beer , wine , etc .
it was very important for us to get through to the people .
and they did this incredible ritual combat dance .
this is the home of the gharial , this incredible crocodile .
this is a relatively clean river .
because we are all dependent on these water sources .
you know , most people are terrified of snakes .
this session is on natural wonders , and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness .
these minor changes in blockages caused a 300 percent improvement in blood flow , and using cardiac positron emission tomography , or &quot; pet , &quot; scans , blue and black is no blood flow , orange and white is maximal .
as one woman said , &quot; i &apos;ve got 20 friends in this package of cigarettes , and they &apos;re always there for me and nobody else is .
for many people , those are choices worth making -- not to live longer , but to live better .
so , the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages -- these are not health foods -- but to go from &quot; bad carbs &quot; to what are called &quot; good carbs . &quot;
and more seriously , there are case reports now of 16-year-old girls who died after a few weeks on the atkins diet -- of bone disease , kidney disease , and so on .
but also , through mechanisms that we don &apos;t fully understand , people who are lonely and depressed are many times -- three to five to ten times , in some studies -- more likely to get sick and die prematurely .
hopefully it won &apos;t stutter .
it &apos;s about a man who &apos;s born old and lives his life in reverse .
sounded great .
but we did know one thing .
and what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers .
and if you look in a comparison , on the left , we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us .
so , in fact , anatomically , it is correct .
from there we went into a process called image analysis .
we worked from dental molds of brad .
a couple of quick factoids ; it really took 155 people over two years , and we didn &apos;t even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut .
the mother bears are usually killed .
this is what happens to the bears when they come in .
and that &apos;s where the hyena comes in .
the guy went up and started dickering , and 10 dollars later , we had four camels .
now , if you &apos;ve ever seen a 2,000 pound camel in a rut , it is a scary , scary thing to behold .
and that will turn it into actually usable water .
don &apos;t even think about it . don &apos;t think about it !
i &apos;m seven ft . , 2,000 lbs . , with brown hair / eyes , long legs ...
bedouins call the camel the gift of god .
and surely , if you &apos;re reading a poem that mentions a cow , you don &apos;t need on the facing page a drawing of a cow .
he says that , &quot; if at first you don &apos;t succeed , hide all evidence you ever tried . &quot;
bc : the next poem is called &quot; the country &quot; and it &apos;s based on , when i was in college i met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine .
and when we lie down in a field or on a couch , drugged perhaps by the hum of a warm afternoon , they think we are looking back at them , which makes them lift their oars and fall silent and wait like parents for us to close our eyes .
thank you . thank you .
this is the way bonobos do it . bonobos do everything with sex .
otherwise they wouldn &apos;t be pulling so hard .
otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears .
one is the body channel .
that &apos;s consolation . it &apos;s very similar to human consolation .
so the one who makes the choices -- that &apos;s the interesting part here -- for the one who makes the choices , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
so cucumber , even though it &apos;s only really water in my opinion , but cucumber is perfectly fine for them .
now another one wrote a whole chapter saying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness if the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes .
it &apos;s important to show not just to show the leader , but the followers , because you find that new followers emulate the followers , not the leader .
and i decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire encyclopedia britannica from a to z -- or , more precisely , from &quot; a-ak &quot; to &quot; zywiec . &quot;
i had to eat right , exercise , meditate , pet dogs , because that lowers the blood pressure .
but i also learned that i was too healthy , and that was unhealthy .
and by the way , it &apos;s also terrible for your brain .
how do i know ? i &apos;m the scientist who did the study .
i have to say , this sounds awesome .
so they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula , this meant the subjects loved their iphones .
this sounds great . a lot of people agree .
now imagine archeologists digging through the rubble of one of our cities .
now we don &apos;t know if it says hollywood , or even bollywood for that matter .
these people believe that the symbols are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs or the emblems you find on shields .
that &apos;s when i was in india , and i had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some indian scientists who were using computer models to try to analyze the script .
there &apos;s a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol .
this is a physics and information theory term .
well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages .
can you write it using pictures ?
but does this prove that these seals contain dravidian names based on planets and star constellations ?
how many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star ?
so what were these strange noises ?
and once again , two scientists have got a problem with noise .
so he was hanging out with the movie star , and of course they were grumbling : &quot; he &apos;s supposed to be religious and all this .
and it &apos;s inside and outside , self and other , and other is all very different .
and we feel ourselves differently . it &apos;s totally strange .
because when you open up like that , then you can &apos;t just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others &apos; misery ?
can i say how delighted i am to be away from the calm of westminster and whitehall ?
go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce and all the protesters .
i was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation .
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility , not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years .
tortured to death .
now if we want to design a foot , what do we have to do ?
it &apos;s still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour .
in 1951 , escher made this drawing . he thought he created an animal fantasy .
maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he &apos;d be brave enough to touch the cockroach .
and watch again , right there -- successful .
so to our blueprint , let &apos;s attach claws .
if we slow it down , they attach their feet at eight milliseconds , and detach them in 16 milliseconds .
it &apos;s just an example of why we need to support curiosity-based research .
it &apos;s not the whole robot yet , we &apos;re working on it -- now you can see how it &apos;s attaching .
they can listen for echoes from prey in order to decide where food is and to decide which one they want to eat .
well let &apos;s look at mothers and calves .
when there was one boat , not much of an impact .
down below here , we see calls made by both males and females that also carry over very long ranges .
now you are listening to a recording made by chris clark , 0.2 miles away from a humpback .
but right in the middle here where there &apos;s a sweet spot , the noise is dominated by human ships .
it &apos;s as if the whole population had to shift from being basses to singing as a tenor .
can &apos;t you move them over to a place where there &apos;s less of a risk ? &quot;
it &apos;s called the worldwide telescope , and i want to thank ted and microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention .
before i introduce the person responsible for the worldwide telescope , i just want to leave you with this brief thought : when i ask people , &quot; how does the night sky make you feel ? &quot;
guys are flaming out academically ; they &apos;re wiping out socially with girls and sexually with women .
and there &apos;s actually a cortical arousal we &apos;re looking at , because guys have been with guys in teams , in clubs , in gangs , in fraternities , especially in the military , and then in pubs .
but who should care ? the only people who should care about this is parents of boys and girls , educators , gamers , filmmakers and women who would like a real man who they can talk to , who can dance , who can make love slowly and contribute to the evolutionary pressures to keep our species above banana slugs .
but what &apos;s even cooler is that if i have two fingers , i can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily .
i can create big things out here , but i can go back and really quickly go back to where i started , and make even smaller things here .
so , multi-touch interaction research is a very active field right now in hci .
what we don &apos;t agree on is what the problem actually is .
the first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy .
let &apos;s do something about it . &quot;
he keeps organizing .
we need ghandis .
but tod couldn &apos;t come and the project is sort of somewhere , i &apos;m not sure whether it &apos;s happening the way we thought , or not .
and you can change the rhythm -- good , michael .
make it wider .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
you know , what are you supposed to do ?
all right . ok . can we show the video of the triangle ?
so , i &apos;ll come back to that in a second . but working with one ball , now , what if you attach something to it , or change it .
because my attempt is to make visual instruments , not to just make -- i &apos;ll try one other thing .
and , we &apos;re just about to announce the zinio reader product that i believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read .
so you can try to get approval , or not , for whatever you &apos;re wearing .
a one-way mirror . i can look out ; you can look at yourself .
it &apos;s called spyfish , and it &apos;s a company called h2eye , started by nigel jagger in london .
this is one guy doing this . this is a pretty spectacular thing .
and the closer we look at anything , the more it disappears .
and nobody really knows what it is or why it &apos;s there .
this is extraordinary . because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes .
the question is , who , then , are we ?
radio waves . there &apos;s another thing .
but we at harvard were wondering if this was really true .
since then , the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions , publishing books .
we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books , and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing .
jm : you might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram , and that &apos;s to tell nietzsche that god is not dead , although you might agree that he might need a better publicist .
now if you can wait a little bit , you should be an author , because then you rise to very great heights , like mark twain , for instance : extremely famous .
so for instance , here -- this suppression index is for 5,000 people picked in english books where there &apos;s no known suppression -- it would be like this , basically tightly centered on one .
it &apos;s not that strove for mediocrity , it &apos;s just that the s used to be written differently , kind of like an f .
now not you , not this talk , but that is generally true .
so , &quot; sonority is time and meaning &quot; -- a great quote .
the first one is silence .
do you remember , i gave you those filters at the beginning .
hello .
on saturday i tweeted for this crate and hat , because i did not want to schlep them from the east coast , and they showed up care of this dude , chris from newport beach , who says hello .
and as usual , the band was psyched , but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn &apos;t bring himself to go out there .
and you can see how many people it is .
so a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price .
then you &apos;re going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement .
she organized a tedx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town .
thousands of people use them and each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution and then walk in the street .
i have one slide on my other life , the computer life , and that &apos;s the slide here .
we &apos;re just going to program computers ; that &apos;s all we need to do .
our bodies are hanging along for the ride , but my brain is talking to your brain .
this is actually a symptom of the fact that we just don &apos;t have a theory .
they all have a lot in common with brain science .
and i &apos;m going to work you through this in a few slides here , give you an example of what this means . here &apos;s a system .
but it has all this complex behavior already .
in humans , we actually developed the front part of the neocortex called the anterior part of the neocortex . and nature did a little trick .
and when you look at people , your eyes are caught over at two to three times a second .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing at the redwood neuroscience institute .
the new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain .
i do not think about what i consider to be peace , which is sustainable peace with justice and equality .
it is all of those things .
she said , &quot; you know , we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country .
when one is arrested and taken to prison , another one comes out and joins the movement , recognizing that if they work together , they will ultimately bring change in their own country .
and we can &apos;t wait for the other guy . we have to do it ourselves .
sometimes they don &apos;t even have enough food , and they live below the poverty line .
and then i put the really tough question : &quot; how many of you hand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets ? &quot;
&quot; wopp ! &quot; they will say .
my mother explained the magic with this machine the very , very first day .
i once -- this was years ago -- i saw ted kennedy and dan quayle meet in the well of the senate .
and it &apos;s led to a view of human nature that we &apos;re rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives , and it &apos;s led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is .
they have kids of their own , and they &apos;ve achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people , so their grandmoms look like gertrude stein , their daughters looks like halle berry -- i don &apos;t know how they &apos;ve done that .
people with strokes and lesions in the emotion-processing parts of the brain are not super smart , they &apos;re actually sometimes quite helpless .
but i think this research shows that the british enlightenment , or the scottish enlightenment , with david hume , adam smith , actually had a better handle on who we are -- that reason is often weak , our sentiments are strong , and our sentiments are often trustworthy .
ninety-six percent of college students say they have above-average social skills .
what picasso did , for example , was take the concept &quot; western art &quot; and the concept &quot; african masks &quot; and blend them together -- not only the geometry , but the moral systems entailed in them .
david brooks : the social animal
my own journey to work with these children started as a teenager .
one story about one man , at least , putting chili powder in her vagina , one man taking a cigarette and burning her , one man whipping her .
you see a girl here who is trained as a welder .
and then she says , &quot; not one of our girls . &quot;
i &apos;m asking you , for these children , whose faces you see , they &apos;re no more .
but people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary , and keep the bad words out .
i would go on a hunger strike before i let them take away google book search from me .
woman &apos;s making a ham for a big , family dinner .
so , think about it this way : if you &apos;ve got an artificial constraint , artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview .
library of congress : 17 million books , of which half are in english .
we don &apos;t even see that there &apos;s a gap on the map .
what newspaper was it in ? what book ?
we can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers .
i watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day , every day , for 18 months .
or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing : did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways ? the ant &apos;s brain , parasitized , to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate ?
number three : i do want to , if i can , find a way of extending the ted experience throughout the year a little bit .
and titus was convicted .
i study false memories .
and so what these studies are showing is that when you feed people misinformation about some experience that they may have had , you can distort or contaminate or change their memory .
i had sometimes armed guards at speeches that i was invited to give , people trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired .
i know what i would choose for a kid of mine .
for geolocation , accuracy matters , and things have only improved over the last 10 years .
it &apos;s not just that you &apos;ll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore , or your child when you &apos;re at disneyland .
we then talked about her coming to my lab and us performing a radio sweep of her car , but i wasn &apos;t even sure that would work , given that some of these devices are configured to only transmit when they &apos;re inside safe zones or when the car is moving .
our modern society has a special relationship with gps .
at first , the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers , though we eventually got it packaged into a small box .
so , as usual , what we see just beyond the horizon is full of promise and peril .
the next work is a sound-sensitive installation that we affectionately call &quot; the pygmies . &quot;
so we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
and this is an important moment , because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help , or save the subject .
and before we have the debate , i &apos;d like to actually take a show of hands -- on balance , right now , are you for or against this ?
and so far there are only three major sources of that -- coal and gas , hydro-electric , which in most places is maxed-out -- and nuclear .
when you add all these things up -- saul griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take to get 13 clean terawatts of energy from wind , solar and biofuels , and that area would be roughly the size of the united states , an area he refers to as &quot; renewistan . &quot;
mark jacobson : thank you .
let &apos;s say we converted all the vehicles in the united states to battery electric vehicles , hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on e85 .
now if we look at nuclear -- with nuclear , what do we have ?
nuclear , the time lag alone will allow the arctic to melt and other places to melt more .
and this is an ongoing research . this is not rocket science .
and then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains isn &apos;t a potential terrorist target .
point well made . thank you .
okay . so , thank you , mark .
but before we get there , we &apos;re engaged in a struggle between good and evil , the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism , and the good shall triumph .
in the last 20 years , western elites tirelessly trotted around the globe selling this prospectus : multiple parties fight for political power and everyone voting on them is the only path to salvation to the long-suffering developing world .
the opposites are true .
china &apos;s highest ruling body , the politburo , has 25 members .
by that point , a typical assignment will be to manage a district with a population in the millions or a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue .
today , it &apos;s the second largest economy in the world , an industrial powerhouse , and its people live in increasing prosperity .
india , the largest democracy in the world , 94 and dropping .
it is wrong . it is irresponsible .
one of the features of a democratic system is a space for civil society to express itself .
you know , it &apos;s funded nasa &apos;s budget up until now .
we shouldn &apos;t be happy in standing for that .
but guys , if history has taught us anything , it &apos;s that if you can imagine it , you will get there eventually .
well , people are going to die , how can you possibly going to put this forward ? &quot;
let me talk about the other thing i &apos;m excited about .
well , it must be a good idea .
and i believe you . i &apos;m sure you &apos;re right .
but in fact it does make a difference , and in fact there &apos;s one particular nerd who has been a particularly effective altruist because he got this .
why ? because if you earn a lot of money , you can give away a lot of money , and if you &apos;re successful in that career , you could give enough to an aid organization so that it could employ , let &apos;s say , five aid workers in developing countries , and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done .
i &apos;m pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations .
it enables you to have a solid basis for self-esteem on which you can feel your life was really worth living .
would they delight us ?
so that means that surfaces can intersect themselves , they can become impossibly small .
they &apos;ve been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty , about technology .
there &apos;s been a lot of talk now about 3d printing .
instead , we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn &apos;t even have dreamt up .
in reality , trying to go from fundamental knowledge to its application is more like this .
that &apos;s danny bessette , 23 years later , because this is the year , and it &apos;s also the year where danny got married , where we have , for the first time , the approval by the fda of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis based upon all this molecular understanding .
sam , please have a seat .
it was developed for cancer . it was azt .
we have made all these discoveries pouring out of laboratories across the world .
not that you do ; i &apos;m just saying .
i &apos;m not sure of how many of you in washington are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region and , the more recent , museum of islamic art opened in qatar in 2008 .
she lives in new york city , but she doesn &apos;t try to be a western artist .
now if you &apos;ll allow me , i would love to share a one-minute film that has proven to show that a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku in telling a big picture .
&quot; know thyself , &quot; that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization that we are traveling .
now , the one time i was in the shed , and my mother suspected something , thinking i was at school .
and so they did .
and then he said , &quot; but i don &apos;t believe that you can do this . &quot; so i said , &quot; ok . &quot;
and then pushing the glass in with its own friction .
so i didn &apos;t think he was going to throw bart off .
because i &apos;ve heard a fly in pain .
and charlton heston is made of a floating fiber , which i took out of the air .
because i had to put the torch on the top .
but i had to rig it with strands of glue .
in every religious tradition , there is the outer path and the inner path , or the exoteric path and the esoteric path .
muslims regard jesus as the master of sufism , the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path .
and these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human .
and one day i was exploring this cul-de-sac hidden away a few streets away .
when they were born at 6 : 14 and 6 : 46 on april 15 , 2005 , our otherwise grim , humorless doctor looked at his watch , and was like , &quot; hmm , april 15th -- tax day .
and it &apos;s apparently okay to marry a boy from georgia , but not to have hair from texas .
and on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle .
and as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland -- the glint that says , &quot; let &apos;s go cow tipping , &quot; even though we never did tip the cow , even though no one tips the cow , even though cows don &apos;t sleep standing up .
and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body .
in fact , if i cling to one memory of this year , it would be walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers grasping the handle underneath my hand .
you may encounter one from time to time , but you &apos;ve got to find a way to get over it , around it , or through it .
and this idea of pausing may be the single biggest lesson i took from my journey .
and she told me last night , in the three months since we &apos;ve done it , we &apos;ve gotten 300 people who &apos;ve contributed to this program .
it is a design that challenges your intuition -- it is not what you think it is when you first see it .
this is a design that once you saw it , you forgot about it .
so there he is with his little laptop computer , but fighting against the might of the pressures -- because of the debt , the foreign debt of ecuador -- fighting the pressure of world bank , imf , and of course the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil .
she does very complex tasks , and i haven &apos;t got time to go into them , but the amazing thing about this female is she doesn &apos;t like making mistakes .
and we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism .
and it &apos;s not sustainable , and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat , so the pygmy hunters in the congo basin who &apos;ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted .
we &apos;re harming ourselves around the world , as well as harming the animals , as well as harming nature herself -- mother nature , that brought us into being ; mother nature , where i believe we need to spend time , where there &apos;s trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development .
every one of us impacts the world around us everyday , and you scientists know that you can &apos;t actually -- even if you stay in bed all day , you &apos;re breathing oxygen and giving out co2 , and probably going to the loo , and things like that -- you &apos;re making a difference in the world .
the philosophy is very simple .
and we &apos;ve talked a lot about that .
so we go from , say , this beautiful and complex crystal as non-life , and this rather beautiful and complex cat on the other side .
we use this idea called self-assembly .
in this protocell model , it &apos;s just an oil droplet , but a chemical metabolism inside that allows this protocell to use energy to do something , to actually become dynamic , as we &apos;ll see here .
and we just put these two together in the same system .
and we put them into one of these experiments , as you &apos;ve seen earlier , and then we watch lively movement that comes out .
so by making these chemical , artificial life experiments , we hope not only to understand something fundamental about the origin of life and the existence of life on this planet , but also what possible life there could be out there in the universe . thank you .
some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed : this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol , or keeping tabs , if you will .
coping with environmental stressors is tricky .
many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality .
you can &apos;t actually build much on a roof , they &apos;re not designed for that .
but we &apos;ve kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly .
you may not have known that you need to communicate with fish , but there is now a device for you to do so .
but in that action , that interaction , by re-scripting that , by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate , that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent , which , like any chelating agent that we use medicinally , binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and pcbs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it &apos;s complexed by a reactive , effectively removing it from bioavailability .
now , if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the earth , that would stretch around the earth 125 times .
it &apos;s produced in the fertilizer industry ; it &apos;s produced in the chemical manufacturing industry .
the automobile becomes , then , an appliance , not in a commodity sense , but an appliance , mobile power , mobile platform for information and computing and communication , as well as a form of transportation .
my dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets .
some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause .
our community deserved a new way of doing things .
thank you .
i became a photographer , abandoned everything and became a photographer , and i started to do the photography that was important for me .
when we received this land , this land was as dead as i was .
we created an incredible amount of pictures , and the result -- lélia did the design of all my books , the design of all my shows . she is the creator of the shows .
a lack of oxygen in the water .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transplant it here .
i started reading about the history and the geography in new york city .
they &apos;re mapping the roads , the buildings , these fortifications that they built .
and the old fields , the successional fields that go .
moreover , we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist , but you can look up what an aspen needs .
we used the tools they use in hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies .
and i think this is what we &apos;re learning about building cities in the future .
and we , at the moment , in our society , have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this .
i don &apos;t need to go into that .
this is in portland . that is an actual development .
it takes its inspiration in form from life .
one place we &apos;re all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones . right ?
like , i don &apos;t know if any of you have seen the movie &quot; city of god ? &quot;
these things are all contributing in a very dynamic way to a huge rise in , especially in the developing world , in people &apos;s interest in and passion for democracy .
this is a fabulous invention , lifestraw .
and i think that we will .
they want to take them out of the domain name system .
taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay .
some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve made out of what we &apos;ve found , and all of it horrifies those industries .
these industries will not be content with breaking our internet .
when i was in graduate school , i had the opportunity to overhear my grandmother describing to one of her fellow senior citizens what i did for a living .
i don &apos;t know why you would want to do that , but i sure wouldn &apos;t want that done to me .
okay , so think of that as , someone gets to go to your car , they get to mess around with it , and then they leave , and now , what kind of trouble are you in ?
i &apos;ve got a few more of these interesting ones .
they found that in every metropolitan area , they would capture over 20 minutes a day of cleartext communication .
so what &apos;s the point ? you can leave your iphone next to someone &apos;s keyboard , and just leave the room , and then later recover what they did , even without using the microphone .
&quot; what is this ?
the education system in india makes you look at paris and new delhi and zurich ; what are you doing in this village ?
you can stay with me for 20 years , go tomorrow .
no water , rocky soil . &quot;
absolutely to the last inch , they can make that cooker .
never seen sweden .
telegraph ? no .
they &apos;re speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers .
&quot; why not ? &quot; &quot; the woman , look how beautiful she is . &quot;
think of the allosphere as a large , dynamically varying digital microscope that &apos;s connected to a supercomputer .
for artists , we &apos;re making new worlds that we can uncover and explore .
as the sound starts to pulse and contract , our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted .
human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life .
what kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head ?
he was 78 years old . he spent 37 years in a louisiana state penitentiary for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
what are these terms ?
that &apos;s the synthesis of happiness .
normal controls show -- that was the magic i showed you ; now i &apos;m showing it to you in graphical form -- &quot; the one i own is better than i thought . the one i didn &apos;t own , the one i left behind , is not as good as i thought . &quot;
this is the difference between dating and marriage , right ?
and look at what we find .
some of these situations may , no doubt , deserve to be preferred to others , but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice , or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds , either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly , or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice . &quot;
it &apos;s a strange kind of love .
why do they do it ? it &apos;s for things like this : gene from alabama drives out there with this rocket that he &apos;s built with x-ray sensors , video cameras , festooned with electronics , and he succeeds getting to 100,000 feet , leaving the atmosphere , seeing a thin blue line of space .
camaguey is a province in cuba .
i &apos;m not telling you that story .
&quot; no . &quot;
blithering fucking idiots .
and i said , &quot; ma , would you slow down ? &quot;
&quot; yeah ? what ?
i sent him to the store , which was my first mistake , and he went to buy underwear , and he bought the grippers , and he &apos;s supposed to buy the boxers . &quot;
and she &apos;s still talking while she puts the car in park , hits the emergency brake , opens the door , and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age , she jumps out of the car , knocks out the phone books , and then she walks around -- she &apos;s carrying her cheap kmart purse with her -- around the front of the car .
&quot; no , mama , you got to look . &quot;
i pull in . i put the car in park .
with her is a young man -- husband , brother , lover , it &apos;s not my job .
and i &apos;m really worried , because when people talk about cars -- which i know something about -- the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking , &quot; let &apos;s use fuel-efficient cars . &quot;
it &apos;s because they said , &quot; it &apos;s eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day .
so , the last example of this is congestion pricing , very famously done in london .
there is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide , respond to emergencies , get traffic moving , provide a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce co2 emissions in every sector .
there isn &apos;t anybody in washington lobbying to make it happen -- or in those municipalities , to build out their cities with these wireless networks -- because there &apos;s zero ongoing communications cost .
what you can do with that tool : we can create an economic engine .
we grew up , and we grew older .
i spoke to him on the phone at 10 : 30 p.m .
i said i wanted to tell you the awesome story , i wanted to share with you the three as of awesome , and i wanted to leave you with a closing thought .
because you all used to be three years old .
it &apos;s just about being you and being cool with that .
i was eating olives with pie .
we &apos;ve got books , buffets and radio waves , wedding brides and rollercoaster rides .
tourist : i &apos;ve been wanting to come down here since this happened .
dr : well the truth of the matter is , post-september 11th , i felt myself in the role originally -- first of all as someone who lives in tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated , and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that i was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm , to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating .
dr : well , it &apos;s a funny thing .
and then everyone was up on the roof , so i ran up there .
and we met with him .
dr : no . in fact i told the contractor to go ahead .
dr : no , i don &apos;t think so .
well , i think that &apos;s interesting .
as you say , it &apos;s not a memorial .
i &apos;ll just say , july .
how many gs ?
isn &apos;t it weird that my 47-year-old husband is forever losing the car ?
ask about what kind of protective equipment is available .
no wonder people are averse to doodling at work .
additionally , it has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing .
the wright brothers , in the beginning of the last century , had for the first time managed to make one of those devices fly .
thirty-four million are infected with hiv .
so surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes , we should be able to do something similar to tackle the hiv / aids epidemic .
this has never been done before .
what about seoul ? seoul , because of broadcast rights , all the games have been in the late afternoon . sun has already been set , so the games have been perceived as comfortable .
so the stadium has a few elements which create that outdoor comfort . first of all , it &apos;s shading . it needs to protect where the people are sitting against strong and warm wind .
so i &apos;d like to encourage you to pay attention to your thermal comfort , to your thermal environment , tonight and tomorrow , and if you &apos;d like to learn more about that , i invite you to go to our website .
i was a bit skeptical , but then , i decided to give him a nokia instead .
it also affords us cheap fabrication , which is fantastic , so it means that you can do a lot more with it .
they are kids who scream at the top of their voices , and you really have to get above that .
so the real key question was , how do we empower this woman ?
so , very briefly , i &apos;ll just explain to you how this is done , because that &apos;s the more interesting part .
so here i get this call from this random guy that &apos;s having an experience that &apos;s being influenced by people at some social distance .
in addition , some questions are immediately raised : how much clustering is there ?
now , headline writers had a field day with our studies .
and , eventually , we became interested in emotions .
and if you look at this image , you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people , again , spreading to three degrees of separation .
and , finally , compare nodes c and d : c and d both have six friends .
they are a kind of social capital .
nicholas christakis : the hidden influence of social networks
study after study is coming to the same conclusion .
and we suspect that this may help to explain why older people are better than younger people at solving hotly-charged emotional conflicts and debates .
when we recognize that we don &apos;t have all the time in the world , we see our priorities most clearly .
so let me , from my personal experiences , give you an insight , so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going down a blind alley .
sunday evening , brussels , april 2010 .
i , overly optimistically , had hoped that this crisis was an opportunity for greece , for europe , for the world , to make radical democratic transformations in our institutions .
so far , we &apos;ve thrown economics at the problem , actually mostly austerity , and certainly we could have designed alternatives , a different strategy , a green stimulus for green jobs , or mutualized debt , eurobonds which would support countries in need from market pressures , these would have been much more viable alternatives .
well , this is exactly where i think europe fits in .
and that hurt . that hurt because that , first of all , hurt the younger generation , and not only , many of them are demonstrating outside , but i think this is one of our problems .
when i was growing up , my heroes were people like fred astaire , gene kelly , michael jackson .
sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it , but sometimes they get a little freaked out .
so i &apos;ve been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the lakota , and that &apos;s a very difficult one for me .
the treaties were out the window .
he was later killed while in custody .
when i look back now from this high hill of my old age , i can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when i saw them with eyes still young .
at least 60 percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold .
i have been told that there must be something we can do .
for babies , it &apos;s deadly .
see , we spent a lot of energy , in many domains -- technological , scientific , hard work , creativity , human ingenuity -- to crack important social problems with technology solutions .
intercropping . intercropping really increases income .
so , if you think of roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields , the breastplates , but part of it was drinking the right water .
how much does the ball cost ? quick .
now the next ones i want you to do quickly and say it out loud .
so now , while you &apos;re thinking about that let &apos;s move to a second task .
the car swerves to avoid it , and therefore doesn &apos;t get into an accident .
this is a pen , it &apos;s called an insulin pen , preloaded .
see what &apos;s really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile , to me , is that the first 999 miles are all about science .
so , there is a little bit of slippage there .
well , it conducts electricity .
what happens if i put in lots of lights and then add a motor ?
we do them for our clients .
as you all know , newsprint yellows significantly in the sun .
now , the shortcut .
so we have an agreement .
so , please mix them .
you agree ? but if you square -- square , and shuffle , and then a cut .
it &apos;s called &quot; bicycle . &quot; and this deck is very flexible , but not so many people know , if you check , if you press at the right spots , you see how thin and flexible this deck is , right ?
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , 10 , 11 , 12 . yes , right .
lg : ten of diamonds , yeah .
excellent . i love that card .
right , sorry , my -- i should have mentioned that , yeah .
perfect , excellent .
armani -- who said armani ? you ?
i have to figure out so many outs , when i miss some cards , but i love it . so now , i will do it . i will try to find the diamonds , but i will do it the hard way .
i work with vibration .
lg : yeah . also listen .
yesterday -- the day before yesterday , i was in vegas , and i used this actually .
they don &apos;t wear shoes . &quot;
i didn &apos;t say , &quot; i &apos;m going to move my shoulder over , move my body . &quot;
a little vivaldi in the background doesn &apos;t do any harm .
of course , i &apos;m not sure they &apos;ll be up to it . &quot;
now , chopin didn &apos;t want to reach the e there , because what will have happened ? it will be over , like hamlet .
almost goes to e , but otherwise the play would be over .
now that is something .
i realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people .
she told me this . she said , &quot; i walked out of auschwitz into life and i made a vow . and the vow was , i will never say anything that couldn &apos;t stand as the last thing i ever say . &quot;
and here &apos;s how it works . suppose i &apos;m the experimenter .
three and a half minutes longer . now this makes no sense right ?
same deal . you : we &apos;re timing for norms .
and for candle problems of any kind , in any field , those if-then rewards , the things around which we &apos;ve built so many of our businesses , don &apos;t work .
in eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments , higher incentives led to worse performance .
management did not emanate from nature .
and it &apos;s worked so well that atlassian has taken it to the next level with 20 percent time -- done , famously , at google -- where engineers can work , spend 20 percent of their time working on anything they want .
if they went head to head , who would win ? &quot;
the aluminum is because it &apos;s very light .
that &apos;s the sun at that end .
and the blue side , the compliment , faces the other way .
i had thought about , a long time ago , in the late &apos; 60s -- when i was just starting out , i was under the influence of thinking about buckminster fuller &apos;s grand project for an electric globe across from the united nations -- and other things that were happening , the space program at that time , and whole earth catalog , things like that .
it could be interacted with large crowds in different ways .
being gay and fathering triplets is by far the most socially innovative , socially entrepreneurial thing i have ever done .
we have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people .
but they have to be asked .
in the same time , the number of for-profits that crossed it is 46,136 .
well , that &apos;s true if it &apos;s a depressing world in which this pie cannot be made any bigger .
that &apos;s about 300 billion dollars a year .
you know , this little office of the conductor .
but viennese audiences do not do that .
he &apos;s awesome . he &apos;s so commanding . yeah ?
you &apos;re using us as instruments , not as partners .
did you see this kind of movement ? let me conduct you . twice .
what do you think karajan &apos;s reply was ? when should i start ?
and you become a partner building the rollercoaster , yeah , with sound , as you actually take the ride .
now something else .
did you see lenny &apos;s face ?
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model , and moderating what comes in at one end , and moderating the outputs at the other end .
but are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ?
but as we &apos;ve seen over the last year , i think that &apos;s an idea that is increasingly coming into question .
transition groups in chile , transition groups in the u.s. , transition groups here , what they &apos;re doing looks very different in every place that you go to .
then they start to form working groups , looking at different aspects of this , and then from that , there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable .
what does it look like if that &apos;s not the case ? and how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody ?
rob hopkins : transition to a world without oil
most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends , and that creates a huge challenge .
this is so blatant , so extreme .
and there &apos;s a discussion : if you &apos;re going to increase class sizes , where do you do that ? how much effect does that have ?
if you go over the education spending and the health care spending -- particularly these long-term trends -- you don &apos;t have that type of involvement on a number that &apos;s more important in terms of equity , in terms of learning .
and that &apos;s the kind of thing -- the investment in the young -- that makes us great , allows us to contribute .
and he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the violin simply would not .
i &apos;d like to end with a quote by john keats , the romantic english poet , a very famous quote that i &apos;m sure all of you know .
a couple of hours later , the sun will shine on the next magnifying glass , and a different smell will be emitted .
you know .
so what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs ?
most people , when this subject is brought up , get tense and resist it : &quot; art doesn &apos;t feed me , and right now i &apos;m busy .
she questions him , &quot; what kind of a person are you going to be ? &quot;
kafka did not show his work to his father .
the french writer michel tournier has a famous saying .
and i explained , &quot; it &apos;s a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch . &quot;
i wish i knew what picasso said back then . i could have argued better with my teacher .
we easily say these sorts of things .
the reason i make them write like crazy is because when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind , the artistic devil creeps in .
so in response to such a pragmatic question , we need to be bold .
just do it !
in 1981 , we published an article in science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 degrees celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing co2 .
let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics -- first , from earth &apos;s energy balance and , second , from earth &apos;s climate history .
these curves for global temperature , atmospheric co2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores , from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet .
i think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels , perhaps even five meters , which is 18 feet , this century or shortly thereafter .
jim dipeso of republicans for environmental protection describes it thusly : &quot; transparent . market-based .
a parachute jump from the very edge of space .
we couldn &apos;t do them without technology .
a company makes a lattix pillar , which is a network , a lattice-type pillar that collapses when it &apos;s hit .
that &apos;s a long way to fall , if you get it wrong . that was just about right .
and this is a guinness world record attempt .
bear in mind , ladies and gents , this was 1960 .
i &apos;m excited and i &apos;m scared , both at the same time in equal measures .
he left the company because he saw , as some other people in the space suit industry , an emerging market for space suits for space tourists .
i think it &apos;s a great challenge .
what you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent . and my contention is , all kids have tremendous talents .
and we run our companies like this , by the way .
everywhere on earth .
they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism .
in fact , creativity -- which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things .
we walked in this room and it was full of people like me . people who couldn &apos;t sit still .
now , the best breeding ground for good comic writing is the stand-up comedy circuit , where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well and you bomb when you do badly .
first , the axis guys recorded a comedy central special that aired in the states , and it was getting great hits on youtube .
in dubai this year , we &apos;ve just had the first all-women &apos;s , homegrown stand-up show .
my challenge to the rest of the world is please , start using positive middle eastern images in your stories .
let &apos;s talk about one other story which has to do with suicide .
fifty percent will have onset by age 14 , 75 percent by age 24 , a picture that is very different than what one would see if you &apos;re talking about cancer or heart disease , diabetes , hypertension -- most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality .
it &apos;s a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like huntington &apos;s or parkinson &apos;s or alzheimer &apos;s disease where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex .
i think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years , but i &apos;d like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who &apos;s thought a lot about changes in concepts and changes in technology .
how are you going to replicate ? &quot;
although they are like in different contexts , one is magical , the other two are like investigation , i like those books because they have something special in them .
the children have taught them .
i had very good friends there , who are from delhi , who are from mumbai .
creating an environment of learning , of inquiry , of exploration is what is true education .
i promise you , parusharam will speak in the ted conference a few years from now .
howard does the experiment , and he gets the data back , and he plots it on a curve , and all of a sudden he realizes it &apos;s not a nice bell curve .
howard loves the yiddish expression &quot; to a worm in horseradish , the world is horseradish . &quot;
ten small bowls of pasta , with a different spaghetti sauce on each one .
and for all those years -- 20 , 30 years -- through all those focus group sessions , no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky .
and instead of charging a dollar-fifty for the eight-ounce bottle , the way that french &apos;s and gulden &apos;s did , they decided to charge four dollars .
and she serves it that way time and time again , and if you quarrel with her , she will say , &quot; you know what ? you &apos;re wrong ! this is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant . &quot;
i &apos;ll give you one last illustration of variability , and that is -- oh , i &apos;m sorry .
one of my favorites is called subclinical acne .
it &apos;s called pre-death .
but everyone is responsible .
of the five senses , vision is the one that i appreciate the most , and it &apos;s the one that i can least take for granted .
which , incidentally , makes me the opposite of dean kamen , because i &apos;m a comic book artist , son of an inventor , and he &apos;s an inventor , son of a comic book artist .
what it comes down to , really , is four basic principles : learn from everyone , follow no one , watch for patterns , and work like hell .
vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage , as well .
the distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny , the penny marshall to the marshall plan to &quot; plan 9 &quot; to nine lives : it &apos;s all the same .
that &apos;s that entire comic you just saw is up on the screen right now .
and whether it &apos;s the opening line from &quot; one hundred years of solitude &quot; or the fantastical stream of consciousness in &quot; autumn of the patriarch , &quot; where the words rush by , page after page of unpunctuated imagery sweeping the reader along like some wild river twisting through a primal south american jungle , reading márquez is a visceral experience .
what i want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives -- comedy as the philosopher &apos;s stone .
his intent is to be funny .
that &apos;s an entire childhood in three words .
cartoon : &quot; what if it &apos;s a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing ? &quot;
my work is play .
taking a long walk by yourself , during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing tiffany &apos;s , is serious .
now , when i was in my early 20s , i worked in the record business , designing record covers for cbs records , and i had no idea what a great job i had .
and i was suddenly a post-modernist , and i began a career as -- in my own business .
i literally for three years made everything -- every scrap of paper , everything online , that this theater did .
and then i found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor , so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense .
bloomberg was all about numbers , and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular led that my partner , lisa strausfeld , programmed .
every single city of the united states is on here .
in fact , mostly now in other things .
and this might be the kind of seas we &apos;re headed for .
of course evolution is somewhat random , and you know , about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said , oh , the heck with the coral reefs -- we &apos;re going to head to the high seas .
and how do you do that ?
and we &apos;d love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of monterey -- but unfortunately , the molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes molas but in the wrong way .
and so the waiting is really the hardest part .
well now with the census of marine life , we &apos;ll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore 90 percent of our living space , with local knowledge .
but as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm -- that &apos;s 28 times per second .
this piece , actually , will be on display down in the sierra simulcast lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show .
usman riaz is a 21-year-old whiz at the percussive guitar , a style he learned to play by watching his heroes on youtube . the fellow plays onstage at tedglobal 2012 -- followed by a jawdropping solo from the master of percussive guitar , preston reed . and watch these two guitarists take on a very spur-of-the-moment improv .
so , indra arrived , and performed the sacrifice of the horse .
and it reaches somewhere where other things don &apos;t .
they try and build it . they try and build pipelines ; it doesn &apos;t happen .
chorus : one , two , three , four folds we make .
it &apos;s what made you smack your baby brother , stamp on a cockroach , scratch your mother .
and there are stand-up comics who are talking about racial issues , about ethnic issues .
&quot; whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage ! &quot;
and it &apos;s a story that did work . it did happen , and the machines are all around us .
lewis richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people , giving them each a little chunk , and putting it together .
oppenheimer , who had built the bomb .
this is modifying ibm equipment , which is the origins of the whole data-processing industry , later at ibm .
twenty-four hours a day , this thing was running , mainly running bomb calculations .
&quot; machine a thing of beauty , and a joy forever . &quot; &quot; perfect running . &quot;
to start this artificial biology going in the machines .
what &apos;s the dividing line between when that is lifelike and when it really is alive ?
my name &apos;s jamie oliver . i &apos;m 34 years old .
it &apos;s sweeping the world .
i want to introduce you to some of the people that i care about : your public , your children .
this is preventable disease . waste of life .
how can you say something is low-fat when it &apos;s full of so much sugar ?
before i crack into my rant , which i &apos;m sure you &apos;re waiting for ...
do you know what that is ?
okay ? there &apos;s sugar in everything .
they owe us , to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket .
marissa , her father died in her hand , i think she &apos;d be quite happy if corporate america could start feeding their staff properly .
it &apos;s incredibly important .
being a victim of hacking for a change .
and as you see , in the middle , there is our old friend , the hacker .
and remember , this is a time when we &apos;re seeing for the first time so-called off-the-shelf malware .
and often they &apos;re the most vulnerable element of all .
but this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator , and he was convicted .
we need to engage and find ways of offering guidance to these young people , because they are a remarkable breed .
it &apos;s increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency .
they &apos;re still having kids -- but generation y hasn &apos;t even started hitting child-rearing age .
and they &apos;ve made this , what was just a store along a commercial strip , into a community gathering space .
plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped .
but it &apos;s important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring -- just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city .
so i &apos;ve shown you some of the first generation of retrofits .
and just the surface appearance are often -- like the astroturf here -- they make me wince .
&quot; you &apos;ve got to get down there on your back , in front of a mirror , full-length preferred . you &apos;ve got to get in the perfect position , with the perfect light , which then becomes shadowed by the angle you &apos;re at .
i am worried about vaginas .
and at first i thought , &quot; oh great , i &apos;ll hear about wonderful orgasms , and great sex lives , and how women love their vaginas . &quot;
but i have also recognized , in the course of seeing that violence , that being in the face of things and seeing actually what &apos;s in front of us is the antidote to depression and to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value .
i was beaten by my husband for five years .
and i would go and pack a little bag and i would wait for mr. alligator to come .
or maybe it &apos;s because when i was a teenager back in the &apos; 50s , my uncle henry -- having denounced the ku klux klan and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard , living under death threat -- took his wife and children to massachusetts for safety and went back to south carolina to face down the klan alone .
he will not steal from us again . &quot;
he also received a visit from the leader of the black community , a minister , who said , &quot; mr. teszler , i sure hope you &apos;re going to hire some black workers for this new plant of yours . &quot;
and i delighted him by rejecting &quot; cavalleria rusticana &quot; in favor of bela bartok &apos;s &quot; bluebeard &apos;s castle . &quot;
well , it occurred to me that i should invite dr. robicsek to lecture at wofford college on -- what else ?
wofford college president ben dunlap tells the story of sandor teszler , a hungarian holocaust survivor who taught him about passionate living and lifelong learning .
tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated , or even themselves , and in addition to that , tapestries were hugely expensive .
we live in an age of ubiquitous information , and sort of &quot; just add water &quot; expertise , but there &apos;s nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well-told narrative , what the curator does , the interpretation of a complex , esoteric subject , in a way that retains the integrity of the subject , that makes it -- unpacks it for a general audience .
bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time , across space , whose lives may have been very different to our own , but who , like us , had hopes and dreams , frustrations and achievements in their lives . and i think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves , helps us make better decisions about where we &apos;re going .
and they are in our backyard .
that &apos;s our two rules .
my mother died in &#91; a &#93; gynecology complication , so i decided to become a gynecology specialist .
when they come to me , they help me to treat the people , to help .
here &apos;s the reason , or not the reason , but here &apos;s why i ask that question .
no , no , that &apos;s the only place a ship &apos;s been .
almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn &apos;t enter it until after neil armstrong and buzz aldrin went to the moon .
it should not be . until one of my colleagues said , &quot; it looks to me like a thermal blister , and the mid-ocean ridge must be a cooling curve . &quot; we said , &quot; let &apos;s go find out . &quot;
we were not predicting it .
bingo . you &apos;d think you &apos;re in air , until a fish swims by .
this ship sank 1,500 years ago .
we can then build a command center .
ocean explorer robert ballard takes us on a mindbending trip to hidden worlds underwater , where he and other researchers are finding unexpected life , resources , even new mountains . he makes a case for serious exploration and mapping . google ocean , anyone ?
what &apos;s suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big stanford classes , each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more .
but it &apos;s not just about the numbers , it &apos;s also about the people .
this one that appeared in science last year , for example , demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice , where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions .
it turns out that previous studies show , like this one by saddler and good , that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades .
so here &apos;s an example of that , also from andrew &apos;s machine learning class .
so the goal here is to try and push , and see how far we can get towards the green curve .
so we don &apos;t really have a place in the universe , as far as on a time line .
like polls . you know , it &apos;s always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of americans who don &apos;t know the answer to any given question is always two percent .
the head is good , body bad .
so you can imagine my surprise on reading in the new yorker that alan greenspan , chairman of the federal reserve , claims ayn rand as his intellectual mentor .
maybe too far . but you know -- i don &apos;t think that a person of color making fun of white people is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color .
and i was looking for a form that didn &apos;t have that .
like for instance a mime once -- or a meme as he called himself .
&quot; oh no . thanks though , i &apos;ll leave them here . thanks very much .
you know the biotech companies are actually going inside us and planting their little flags on our genes .
finding the balance between those things is always dangerous because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared .
nobody wants to hear that . not after this !
we don &apos;t really have mental health insurance in this country , and it &apos;s -- -- it &apos;s really a crime .
how much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan to negotiate with an advanced species ?
and they get to prioritize , you know ?
secondly , we have a natural laboratory surrounding the earth .
oh , and here &apos;s one other thing .
this is rocket science , but it &apos;s not hard rocket science .
we gotta fix that . we gotta outlaw that right away .
in 1908 , just a 200-foot piece of a comet exploded over siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles .
because we can actually figure out every asteroid that &apos;s out there , and if it might hit earth , and when it might hit earth .
we know about this stuff .
i hope it will be .
that &apos;s one of the themes that sylvia reminds us about : understand this ocean of ours , this basic life support system , the dominant life support system on the planet .
it &apos;s an astonishing insight , and we have only found out about this recently .
and let me show you what &apos;s behind it .
that &apos;s an elevator that &apos;s constantly moving up and down , but it can be controlled by the folks on land who are responsible for it .
and this is the magic one .
this -- i &apos;ve shown you sea floor -- but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth .
and that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities , the greatest spaces that we have had .
i have never been a fan of the neutral .
and i think our architecture is a confrontation with our own senses .
but the computer should not just be the glove of the hand ; the hand should really be the driver of the computing power .
because architecture is also the asking of questions .
and i often think of the raw and the refined .
it &apos;s an art of communication .
and there of course is the space that we need to breathe , is the space we need to dream .
compromise , if it &apos;s artistic , if it is able to cope with its strategies -- and there is my first sketch and the last rendering -- it &apos;s not that far away .
in fact , even if producing co2 was good for the environment , given that we &apos;re going to run out of hydrocarbons , we need to find some sustainable means of operating .
i think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge .
do you see that coming , really , truly , or just on a few key routes ?
em : well actually , i &apos;m confident that solar will beat everything , hands down , including natural gas .
and they have an expected return on that capital .
and they &apos;d look at me , like , &quot; is he serious ? &quot;
so the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight .
all right , let &apos;s see that video then , because this is actually amazing when you think about it .
but when you want to do something new , you have to apply the physics approach .
wind and time have twisted our landscape into very strange shapes , and these shapes are speckled with wildlife that has become so adapted to this harsh and strange land .
whenever we tried to hunt , we were called poachers .
but then , the people from irdnc proposed to joshua : what if we pay people that you trust to look after wildlife ?
they were not people from outside .
this is outside the protected area .
sustainability represents the what , the where and the how of what is caught .
but it &apos;s a lion of the sea . it &apos;s a top predator .
it comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia breaded with dijon mustard and crispy , broiled breadcrumbs and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf with crunchy , grilled broccoli so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside with just a hint of chili flake .
it &apos;s about the way that we look at our plates .
mound up those four plates with vegetables and then open up the very best bottle of burgundy you have , light the candles and celebrate it .
there &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world .
they are powered by the sun . solar panels power them .
we &apos;ve done films . we &apos;ve done books . we have more coming .
we &apos;re now at the columbia glacier in alaska .
these changes in the alpine world are accelerating .
on up to iceland .
the interior of greenland is to the right .
fortunately , a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now .
sometimes , it took a more , took a veneer of sophistication , and people said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s nothing to do with indians .
the other thing we were told then was , &quot; yes , but , you know , the kind of work that is coming out of the indian r &amp; amp ; d center cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the u.s. r &amp; amp ; d centers . &quot;
without that , you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today .
well , in 2010 , they decided they &apos;re not going to reveal this data anymore , so i had to make some estimates based on various sources .
i had been traveling to one country after another .
the other explanation or , in a way , the solution suggested , is please fix all of these things : the schools , the community , the homes , the families , everything .
and so there &apos;s good news about this , though , because there &apos;s a way to reverse epidemics , and there &apos;s really only three things that are done to reverse epidemics , and the first of it is interrupting transmission .
there have been independent evaluations supported by the justice department and by the cdc and performed by johns hopkins that have shown 30-to-50-percent and 40-to-70-percent reductions in shootings and killings using this new method .
where there &apos;s really been uptake even faster is in the international environment , where there &apos;s a 55-percent drop in the first neighborhood in puerto rico , where interruptions are just beginning in honduras , where the strategy has been applied in kenya for the recent elections , and where there have been 500 interruptions in iraq .
it is four in the morning . &quot;
in 1996 , he shot himself in the head on december ninth -- which incidentally is judi dench &apos;s birthday .
or you can go to the random house website where there is this excerpt .
and once our lives are touched by cancer , we quickly learn that there are basically three weapons , or three tools , that are available to fight the disease : surgery , radiation and chemotherapy .
and in that space station we have the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
the one up there can &apos;t divide at all .
robert dill-bundi is a famous swiss cycling champion .
this is a therapy that takes time to work .
and when we talked to her , she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy , she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions .
clouds seldom visit this area .
but here it is unwritten by law .
but we will come back , once again , to the traditional thing .
somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here .
but this is not ground water .
if the water table goes down , you will find new stairs .
and these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives .
and malaria nets actually are playing a role in that .
we hear a lot about china , and they do lend a lot of money , but 60 percent of the fdi in the last couple of years has come from europe , america , australia , canada .
they chose instead turkey and mexico to set up the textiles factories , because their education levels were 25 to 30 percent .
education is helping growth and investment , and that &apos;s giving budget revenues , which is giving governments more money , which is helping growth through education .
i would like to see if you can all now become economists , because if growth for the last 10 years has been five and a half percent , what do you think the imf is forecasting for the next five years of growth in africa ?
and you know what ?
it was never popular with many political leaders , especially those in the united states who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn &apos;t .
there was a big case in february 2009 called &quot; elude the cat . &quot;
because they say , &quot; well look , we asked you , we consulted you , you voted on it .
and this is realistic . and there is nothing wrong about it because the internet has greatly empowered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them .
there was a period of time when my wife -- her name is tammie -- and i , we just got real busy and whip , bam , boom : kendall and jay .
and as we were preparing to come back from the burial , the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city .
that &apos;s what the sisters said , &quot; he was fine . &quot;
she &apos;s 16 years old .
you see , we have to come to understand that less value , property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can &apos;t happen without it .
is it the economy ? well , we have now the fifth-largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms .
in fact , those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country , including the u.s. and china , has ever established in the history of telecommunications .
and it &apos;s the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics , so i said sure .
one simple fact : you couldn &apos;t try to call an afghan at 8 : 30 in the evening .
the story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism .
we have 23 official languages that are recognized in our constitution .
so as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; man , why doesn &apos;t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to bathe ? &quot;
we realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want drybath .
and i said , why don &apos;t you use that ?
here &apos;s what happened . see that line on the very top with the little dots ?
this is sea-monkeys .
so , in this room , there &apos;s 20 percent oxygen or so , and if we reduce the oxygen concentration , we will all be dead .
so i wondered : might we be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a state in us ?
and so we thought , like in a game of musical chairs , might we be able to give a person some hydrogen sulfide , and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind ?
and with money we got from darpa , we could show just that .
so it &apos;s really incredible for me to be a part of this .
we adore babies because they &apos;re so cute .
it was a hyperstimulus for them , and they loved it .
democracy is in trouble , no question about that , and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded .
in the developed world , it &apos;s about 78 percent .
washington , beijing , paris , as world capitals , are anything but pragmatic , but real city mayors have to be pragmatists .
and as a result , mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level , and this is the third feature about mayors , than national governing officials .
it helped unemployment , because people could get across town , and it had a profound impact on climate as well as many other things there .
and the only question is , are you ?
he got exactly the same response : lots and lots of sorry &apos;s .
don &apos;t know what they do with that , but they have one .
it &apos;s not that hard . most of your kids figure out how to do this in the first 10 seconds , when they pick it up .
this is some aluminum foil , right ? you use it in the kitchen .
keep your hands up if you did 10 .
you might know it as , &quot; how many uses can you find for a paper clip ? &quot;
now , if the eameses had stopped with that first great solution , then we wouldn &apos;t be the beneficiaries of so many wonderful designs today .
at ideo there &apos;s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel sometimes about the environment .
but you know , many adults are pretty reluctant to engage with role-play .
so when a kid dresses up as a firefighter , you know , he &apos;s beginning to try on that identity .
as designers , we need to be able to transition in and out of play also .
but then i stopped , because i figured , &quot; oh , you know , i made it .
and clients didn &apos;t call .
i dreamed of it , and that &apos;s all i dreamed of .
i decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life .
afterwards , i played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to .
thank you .
and i &apos;ve just chosen a few of them here .
we &apos;re not finished with the video yet .
and these things are very effective , it turns out , so effective that they motivate people to engage in unsafe driving behaviors -- like not stopping on a red headlight .
now i don &apos;t say that is necessarily a bad thing .
our designs are not ethical or unethical in that they &apos;re using ethical or unethical means of persuading us .
so these are the kinds of layers , the kinds of questions i wanted to lead you through today -- the question of , what are the intentions that you bring to bear when you &apos;re designing something ?
note the textbook , the sage on the stage , and the sleeping guy in the back .
that &apos;s just what we were going for .
well , we tried some old ideas and some new and put them together , but there are more ideas to try .
now , the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod , and these guys open up snails for a living .
the whole limb extends out . the body flexes backwards -- just a spectacular movement .
and it &apos;s surrounded by membranous areas . and those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure .
a load cell measures forces , and this is actually a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it .
and i hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light .
so , the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring -- has actually been well known to biologists for a long time , not as a spring but as a visual signal .
this is an ocean planet .
this , i think , represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built .
i don &apos;t know of any other submersible , or even remote , that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space .
now , look at that ; look , it &apos;s -- she just blew me away .
so we opened the world &apos;s first flight school .
they are inherently unstable , and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly .
here , you see that it &apos;s stable , and even if i give it little nudges , it goes back to the nice , balanced position .
if we analyze the mathematical model of this machine with only two working propellers , we discover that there &apos;s an unconventional way to fly it .
they perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me .
as time goes on , gravity will be increased until we &apos;re all back on planet earth , but i assure you we won &apos;t get there .
and i found myself sort of scratching at the walls of life , as if i was trying to find a way out into a wider space beyond .
the numbers of deer , because there was nothing to hunt them , had built up and built up in the yellowstone park , and despite efforts by humans to control them , they &apos;d managed to reduce much of the vegetation there to almost nothing , they &apos;d just grazed it away .
so the wolves , small in number , transformed not just the ecosystem of the yellowstone national park , this huge area of land , but also its physical geography .
the other one is the rewilding of human life .
it was a lot bigger than the asian elephant .
i mean , these sort of top-down , mono-functional , capital-intensive solutions are really not going to cut it .
one is to develop a new artificial ecology , a reef out in the harbor , that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the gowanus .
so this image is simply showing -- it &apos;s a field of marine piles interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope .
and finally , how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef .
so , you would just walk around london at this point and just be overwhelmed with this stench .
just an extraordinary , terrifying scene .
and what it ended up doing is making the idea of large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one .
and he spent 33 years in prison .
same thing : gave her a picture , she held it up to her forehead .
and i couldn &apos;t even see the monkeys that they were getting with these darts .
you know , getting kids used to different realities , i think , is so important . what dan dennett said the other day -- having a curriculum where they study different religions , just to make a mental flexibility , give them a mental flexibility in different belief systems -- i think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place .
but the other motivating factor is the insular nature of our country .
so that &apos;s sort of the part , and let me move on then and show you the hubble ultra deep field .
but you get out to jupiter and it &apos;s 40 minutes away . it &apos;s a problem .
so there was the cobe satellite , which was launched in 1989 , and we discovered these variations .
there are some places you can &apos;t look because of our own galaxy , or because there are no telescopes available to do it .
that is , we have to seriously play god , not just change people &apos;s lives , but make the universe , right .
so we live in the boonies .
and we &apos;re going to fly around , and we &apos;ll fly around , and you &apos;ll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect , and you get a large cluster of galaxies .
and you see how the dark matter lumps up , and the ordinary matter just trails along behind .
you can see that just from the map alone .
you know , the mind whizzes away like a washing machine going round and round , lots of difficult , confusing emotions , and we don &apos;t really know how to deal with that , and the sad fact is that we are so distracted that we &apos;re no longer present in the world in which we live .
i think the present moment is so underrated .
you go back to it , repeat it . &quot; oh , i am worried .
this was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist .
and i was in a dark place for a long time , unable to create .
then i opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally .
and instead of telling each other to seize the day , maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation .
i mean , were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them , or both ?
the benefits of hardy , physical living , but an environment made toxic by a complicated , little-understood enemy , radiation .
thank you .
i &apos;m still excited by technology , but i believe , and i &apos;m here to make the case , that we &apos;re letting it take us places that we don &apos;t want to go .
a 50-year-old business man lamented to me that he feels he doesn &apos;t have colleagues anymore at work .
connecting in sips may work for gathering discreet bits of information , they may work for saying , &quot; i &apos;m thinking about you , &quot; or even for saying , &quot; i love you , &quot; -- i mean , look at how i felt when i got that text from my daughter -- but they don &apos;t really work for learning about each other , for really coming to know and understand each other .
it doesn &apos;t know life . &quot;
so before it was : i have a feeling , i want to make a call .
i see some first steps .
they need us .
&apos;i failed ! &apos; he cried .
and all about a gathering of teachers , farmers , merchants , laborers : those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow .
the youngsters didn &apos;t have to feel that we were going to keep them over .
and they are . they want to change everything .
and so the fates are seldom wrong , no matter how they twist and wind .
i can never answer that , as far as the individuals are concerned .
and neither one could jump very well , but they got -- kept good position , and so they did well rebounding . they remembered that every shot that is taken , they assumed would be missed .
but it &apos;s actually not a new field .
and that &apos;s exactly what we did here .
a few weeks later , you have your engineered organ that we &apos;re able to implant back into the patient .
that &apos;s what you see here on the right side .
put a pair of gloves here .
i &apos;ve got it for life , so i &apos;m all set .
anthony atala : printing a human kidney
now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as swaptree , but that &apos;s not my interest , and nor is swap trading , per se .
now what i find fascinating about these examples is how they &apos;re actually tapping into our primate instincts .
and although they vary enormously in scale , maturity and purpose , when we dived into them , we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems .
so when you consider these two facts , it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright .
now all of these systems require a degree of trust , and the cornerstone to this working is reputation .
stayed when everybody else was dropping out .
so the blind man went down on his knees , down like this , and told the man with no legs to go over his back , and stood up .
so as i continue to be a member of parliament and as i continue listening to all of you talking about botany , talking about health , talking about democracy , talking about new inventions , i &apos;m hoping that one day in my own little community -- which is 26,000 square kilometers , maybe five times the size of rhode island -- with no roads , we &apos;ll be able to become a model to help others develop .
there were a couple large , sweaty men with chainsaws standing in the center of the church , but nobody knew where to send them because no one knew the extent of the damage yet .
co : you sent me to that place on washington street yesterday , and now i &apos;m covered in poison ivy .
in a disaster , however , you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity .
we flew into a town that had a static outdated website and a frenetic facebook feed trying to structure the response .
after a natural disaster strikes , there &apos;s only a tiny window of opportunity to rally effective recovery efforts before the world turns their attention elsewhere . who should be in charge ? when a freak tornado hit their hometown , sisters caitria and morgan o &apos;neill -- just 20 and 24 at the time -- took the reins and are now teaching others how to do the same .
because i think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is .
the flies buzzed hungrily around his legs .
people dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs .
and what hotel means , in kenya and india , is an eating-place .
so , these are the civic leaders of the future .
i was born premature by about 10 weeks , which resulted in my blindness , some 64 years ago .
but think of it . these men , who hadn &apos;t had the educational opportunities i &apos;d had , helped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law by their dedicated help .
in 1974 , the great ray kurzweil , the american inventor , worked on building a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech .
this technology that fascinated me in 1987 is now on my iphone and on yours as well .
and remember i was telling you about harry potter .
for 12,000 years , the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid , with the oldest on top .
but hey , you &apos;re listening to me .
this is the best economic news on the planet these days .
and reuther shoots back , &quot; hey henry , how are you going to get them to buy cars ? &quot;
for example , in 1960 they were both very likely to have full-time jobs , working at least 40 hours a week .
i was a montessori kid for the first few years of my education , and what that education taught me is that the world is an interesting place and my job is to go explore it .
abraham lincoln realized there was one other ingredient .
now , i would say , &quot; well , why don &apos;t you just work with them one-on-one ? &quot;
so we thought , &quot; ha ha ! really ! &quot;
anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we waited .
and then secondly , there &apos;s a publishing company in the back .
so that &apos;s partly why the tutor corps grew so fast .
and that &apos;s actually the brunt of what we do is , people going straight from their workplace , straight from home , straight into the classroom and working directly with the students .
we sell all the student books .
they didn &apos;t think that that was going to work there .
i just came and visited and said , &quot; yes , you guys are doing great , &quot; or whatever . that was it . you can see the time in all five boroughs of new york in the back .
these are spaces that are only affiliated with us , doing this same thing : word st. in pittsfield , massachusetts ; ink spot in cincinnati ; youth speaks , san francisco , california , which inspired us ; studio st. louis in st. louis ; austin bat cave in austin ; fighting words in dublin , ireland , started by roddy doyle , this will be open in april .
the schools need you . the teachers need you .
i had my own personal responses , but i also have a public role , and something needed to be said .
and the answer was , &quot; god is in this with us , or god doesn &apos;t deserve our allegiance anymore . &quot;
after the tragedy , survival stories began to emerge .
this seems more acceptable , but it still leaves god with the ultimate moral responsibility .
in presence and in absence . in simplicity and complexity .
by seeking the inwardness which is in all things .
so , what is this stuff that we &apos;re all consumed by , and bothered by ?
you can &apos;t do very much learning in your own life , it &apos;s so short , and there &apos;s nobody to pass on what you do learn .
so , it &apos;s a force that is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet , and in such a degree that i think that it &apos;s become our -- who we are .
one trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this , is actually increasing .
and that &apos;s the thing that bothers most people , is that progress is really real , but we wonder and question : what are the environmental costs of it ?
so , maybe spraying ddt on crops is a really bad idea .
kevin kelly : technology &apos;s epic story
these are the sounds you would expect , but they are also the sounds of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds screeching in the night , the high-pitched honest cries of children and the thunderous , unbearable silence .
how interesting .
there is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting , and there is a side that thinks that peace is the arrival of schools and jobs .
she learned about her rights .
what i want to do today is to spend some time talking about some stuff that &apos;s sort of giving me a little bit of existential angst , for lack of a better word , over the past couple of years , and basically , these three quotes tell what &apos;s going on .
there were wonderful , incredible ideas that were always percolating , and so much of what &apos;s cool or hot today is really based on some of those concepts , whether it &apos;s , you know , people trying to use the prime directive from star trek being involved in things , or again that three-dimensional weaving and fax machines that i read about in my weekly readers that the technology and engineering was just getting started .
biotechnology is constructive .
and folks say we need to choose either or .
and government funding is decreasing in spending and then they &apos;re saying , let &apos;s have corporations take over , and that &apos;s not true . government funding should at least do things like recognize cost-benefits of basic science and engineering research . we have to know that we have a responsibility as global citizens in this world .
i like to think of ideas as potential energy .
very few answers . i &apos;m also wondering myself , what is simplicity ?
but then i thought , &quot; oh , simplicity . what would that be like on a beach ?
many of you may not like tofu because you haven &apos;t had good tofu , but tofu &apos;s a good food . it &apos;s a very simple kind of food .
this is a sad thing , but it &apos;s actually a happy thing in a way , because you can remember them in their pure form .
this is a floral theme calendar in 1997 , and this is a firework calendar . so , you launch the number into space , because the japanese believe that when you see fireworks , you &apos;re cooler for some reason .
this is a new way to type , on my old , color classic .
and so , i began to crinkle up potato chip flecks , and also pretzels .
the three keys are easy to eat , so this is anago , cooked already , so easy to eat .
this was given to me by the chairman of shiseido .
perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism .
to put it in perspective , 2005 was the previous record .
well , the alliance for climate protection , which i head in conjunction with current tv -- who did this pro bono -- did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this .
junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse . developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent . here are just a few of the investments that i personally think make sense .
one final point : i &apos;m optimistic , because i believe we have the capacity , at moments of great challenge , to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us .
we need help . we need help .
but designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them .
the exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists , and show how they &apos;re presenting the possibilities of the future to us .
then , he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat -- of course , this is done with a japanese resins food maker , but you know , in the future it could be made better -- which reproduces the best mri scan of the best cow he could find .
so the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future , and this is chosen as an example .
they had a particular shape that they had to stay in .
so he designed all these series of accessories .
but as a physicist , i thought , well if you give me some data , i could maybe understand this . you know , give us a go .
and on the vertical axis you &apos;ve got the number of attacks .
what we &apos;re saying here is the probability of an attack killing x number of people in a country like iraq is equal to a constant , times the size of that attack , raised to the power of negative alpha .
alpha is the structure . it &apos;s got a stable state at 2.5 .
thank you .
and these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world .
we actually have to do something about it .
what does it mean , &quot; dough becomes leaven &quot; ?
god , the one who rules the entire universe , wants my bread ? &quot;
and so try to bring compassion to life in this world .
and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals , she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist .
but it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation , amplification and , in the case of pain , the distortion of sensory experiences .
a chunk of rock six miles across , moving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet , slammed into the earth .
now , this is not a 200-mile-wide crater , but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here , about the size of a football , that hit that car and did that damage .
but they will do global economic damage , because they don &apos;t have to hit , necessarily , to do this kind of damage .
it &apos;s roughly 250 yards across , so it &apos;s pretty big -- big size , you know , bigger than a football stadium -- and it &apos;s going to pass by the earth in april of 2029 .
you shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing , you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you &apos;ll just miss it .
this probe actually can &apos;t use chemical rockets .
according to relevant researchers , 83 percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press .
we were actually recording history .
you know , in my defense , there was no google at that time ; you could not just google in &apos; 91 .
so here we are having our first client , brilliant .
what is most important is we do it either in form of loans , equities , lease -- whatever is appropriate for , you know , supporting anybody .
so what the governor got was an empty shell .
instead of all of that we thought there is -- something new needs to be invented .
thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here .
i &apos;ll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer , and that is , it has nothing to do with human beings .
you &apos;ve heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway .
here &apos;s an example of this similarity .
the next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that .
there &apos;s the story , which is not absolutely certain to be right , but a lot of people told it .
that &apos;s a general rule , and it &apos;s critically important to realize that .
it was said when he got a copy of the king james bible or &quot; aesop &apos;s fables , &quot; he was so excited he couldn &apos;t sleep .
so fueled by that ambition , he returned to the state legislature .
but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a new year &apos;s reception .
we had a big dance at the white house .
and he started out , &quot; doris , more than any other woman i have ever known ... &quot; and my heart sank .
his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in illinois .
because at first , i &apos;d be so excited i would blurt out , &quot; the dodgers won ! &quot; or , &quot; the dodgers lost ! &quot;
and i had to say , every night when i said my prayers .
it &apos;s about the size of a rugby ball .
and that is what this cylinder is , the declaration made by the ruler guided by god who had toppled the iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people .
what was going on was the fundamental shift in middle eastern history .
after alexander , the other empires , babylon declines , falls into ruins , and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a british museum exhibition digging in babylon .
and the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion .
and the obvious emblem is cyrus .
it is a document that can mean so many things , for iran and for the region .
this forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical , social , language , cognitive and psychomotor development .
lack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors like hand-flapping , rocking back and forth , or aggression , and in some institutions , psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children , whilst in others , children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others .
the european commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support , empowering communities to look after their own children .
maybe i can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference .
he saw the bomb go off at nagasaki .
for me , it was really about the process .
i felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day .
it never happened .
and then unama became involved in afghanistan .
and we did , and we traveled around , and we spoke to elders , we spoke to doctors , we spoke to nurses , we held press conferences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with isaf , we sat down with nato , we sat down with the u.k. government .
and then that year , that year , 2008 , this isaf statement from kabul , afghanistan , september 17th : &quot; general stanley mcchrystal , commander of international security assistance forces in afghanistan , announced today isaf will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of september . &quot;
why don &apos;t you support the process of the largest ever global truce ?
and there &apos;s a wonderful man sitting in this audience , and i don &apos;t know where he is , who said to me a few days ago -- because i did a little rehearsal -- and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares , and one of them is white . &quot;
it seems quite vexing .
it seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain , or in any other brain for that matter .
and so was darwin .
nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate .
the human brain is puzzling -- it is curiously large given the size of our bodies , uses a tremendous amount of energy for its weight and has a bizarrely dense cerebral cortex . but : why ? neuroscientist suzana herculano-houzel puts on her detective &apos;s cap and leads us through this mystery . by making &quot; brain soup , &quot; she arrives at a startling conclusion .
it completely blows apart the way that perfume is , and provides a whole new format .
and then , not only for war victims , but it was for any kind of patient .
i ducked .
and i spoke with a gatekeeper .
believe me , i was worried because i was breaking the rules .
two groups of mujahideen started fighting .
and he was standing in front of me , his head down .
i said , &quot; listen , it &apos;s insane .
it became a policy of &quot; positive discrimination , &quot; we call it now .
they are my teachers .
alberto cairo &apos;s clinics in afghanistan used to close down during active fighting . now , they stay open . in this powerful talk , cairo tells the moving story of why -- and how he found humanity and dignity in the midst of war . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now what does this have to do with leadership ?
because of his uniform they speak to him differently , and they explain to him that they &apos;re just following orders .
and i was part of that .
now , i was a little scared because when you see those three problems , they seem really hard to deal with .
and he signs off , &quot; thank you . &quot;
and it gives me a lot of hope .
this is just a tiny part of the sky the kepler stares at , where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars , all at once , every half hour , and very precisely .
i &apos;m showing here venus , earth and mars -- three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live .
i know you &apos;re out there , they told me backstage , it &apos;s a full house and such .
oh , they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods .
we paid a lot of money for that information , be we didn &apos;t get it .
it was a game of hunting questions like this .
now , without that , how could we possibly function ?
now these people need to be stopped , seriously now .
now that is true . that is what homeopathy is all about .
they shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors .
i study health systems in these countries .
so it runs frequently , the entire hospital , just on a generator .
and after umpteen surgeries and , you can imagine , really unspeakable tragedy , he just said , &quot; that &apos;s it . i &apos;m done . that &apos;s enough .
in both cases , whether you have power or not , sometimes the patient needs help breathing .
one of those partnerships is with johns hopkins just here in baltimore .
the akan of people of ghana and &#91; cote d &apos;ivoire &#93; developed adinkra symbols some 400 years ago , and these are proverbs , historical sayings , objects , animals , plants , and my favorite adinkra system is the first one at the top on the left .
that is , until 1998 , when one yale professor john coleman darnell discovered these inscriptions in the thebes desert on the limestone cliffs in western egypt , and these have been dated at between 1800 and 1900 b.c. , centuries before mesopotamia .
then hear this , please .
not bad .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
in fact , when margarine was invented , several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink , so we &apos;d all know that it was a fake .
oranges became common in new york .
and this took care of the situation resoundingly .
think of the frozen chicken nugget .
and this is not only an issue of social justice , as ann cooper said -- and , of course , she &apos;s completely right -- but it &apos;s also one of global survival .
i &apos;ll never stop eating animals , i &apos;m sure , but i do think that for the benefit of everyone , the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly .
we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s .
so , please ask yourselves , for your health , for your pocketbook , for the environment , for the animals : what &apos;s stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot ?
&#91; in the future , everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes . &#93; what if we flip this ?
nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with narcissus .
once you think about it , you see this is not statistical points ; these are -- let &apos;s see , how far have i talked ?
he estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century : 50 percent .
and you wonder , why can &apos;t it be like that all the time ?
now , when we think about changing human nature , the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies -- growth hormone therapy , cosmetic surgery , stimulants like ritalin , adderall , anti-depressants , anabolic steroids , artificial hearts .
it &apos;s just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with , and to remember what you have learned .
it &apos;s just a single gene .
and so i went about and made that sculpture , turning it out of solid bronze .
so the evolution of this -- i gather this isn &apos;t your first pendulum .
ts : yes , they &apos;re servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes .
and i love the shapes that i see in scientific observations and apparatus , especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it , the scale , is very interesting to me .
you think of yourself as the servant .
thanks to chernobyl , we get asylum in the u.s .
but he did have one thing .
but when i was little , i remember , he would kill flies in our house with my bb gun .
and then i realized one day , there &apos;s an easier solution to this .
and what i loved about her work is , when i would walk around it and look down into the sky , looking down to watch the sky , and it unfolded in a new way .
he draws sticks real good . &quot;
and so she came up with creating these pocket-sized artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them .
so you open the box and you think , &quot; whoa , there &apos;s a snake in there . &quot;
next is roy penig , a really interesting kentucky artist , and he &apos;s the nicest guy .
and after this one , there &apos;s 77 other artists .
but even more importantly , he created a language , a way we could communicate , a code of dots , dashes and arrows .
so that &apos;s four simple laws . that &apos;s all you need in origami .
and then once i have that folded shape that we call the base , you can make the legs narrower , you can bend them , you can turn it into the finished shape .
so , no matter how i make a flap , it needs some part of a circular region of paper .
we found we could do insects , spiders , which are close , things with legs , things with legs and wings , things with legs and antennae .
surprisingly , origami and the structures that we &apos;ve developed in origami turn out to have applications in medicine , in science , in space , in the body , consumer electronics and more .
but this pattern &apos;s not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters .
well , the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school .
to combine engineering and design and ...
for a long time , this is the image of american manhood that dominated -- tough , rugged , in control of his own environment .
these are headlines about what &apos;s been going on with women in the next few years .
watch what happens to the women . watch what happens to the men .
now one day it might be that mothers will hire an out-of-work , middle-aged , former steelworker guy to watch their children at home , and that would be good for the men , but that hasn &apos;t quite happened yet .
hr : so there you go .
it &apos;s happening all over the world .
you &apos;ve got our new james bond , who &apos;s angelina jolie .
hanna rosin reviews startling new data that shows women actually surpassing men in several important measures , such as college graduation rates . do these trends , both us-centric and global , signal the &quot; end of men &quot; ? probably not -- but they point toward an important societal shift worth deep discussion .
and also , there &apos;s way more cells in your brain than the number of straws in a typical haystack .
so it will not allow us to control a memory in real time .
sr : so you can think of freezing as , you &apos;re walking down the street minding your own business , and then out of nowhere you almost run into an ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend , and now those terrifying two seconds where you start thinking , &quot; what do i do ? do i say hi ?
xl : &quot; yes , &quot; i said . &quot; indeed it worked ! &quot;
so here we &apos;re trying to artificially make an association between the memory of the blue box and the foot shocks themselves .
can we edit the content of our memories ? it &apos;s a sci-fi-tinged question that steve ramirez and xu liu are asking in their lab at mit . essentially , the pair shoot a laser beam into the brain of a living mouse to activate and manipulate its memory . in this unexpectedly amusing talk they share not only how , but -- more importantly -- why they do this .
and the interview was 40 pages long .
he can &apos;t feel even that he &apos;s hungry or tired .
it &apos;s kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you &apos;re working .
and if you want to enter flow from control , you have to increase the challenges .
speed x 4 .
and in 1960 , all swedes were saving to try to buy a volvo like this .
this is the new world we have today in 2010 .
the year is 1960 .
and look at the position of the old west .
i &apos;m from edinburgh . worse news , that &apos;s even edinburgh .
now , in aberdeen , i started my dermatology training .
but what we found was that we couldn &apos;t reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice .
so vitamin d is good for you -- it stops rickets , it prevents calcium metabolism , important stuff .
in summer , you might as well be at the equator .
kids , when we grow up , have dreams , and we have passions , and we have visions , and somehow we get those things crushed .
our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs .
and what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re giving them ritalin and saying , &quot; don &apos;t be an entrepreneurial type .
when i was growing up as a young kid , i had no choice , because i was taught at a very early , young age -- when my dad realized i wasn &apos;t going to fit into everything else that was being taught to me in school -- that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age .
and he &apos;s like , &quot; well , we don &apos;t need one . &quot;
so not only would he get me one , but i had to get two , and then he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers , which i did , and then i realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money .
because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion .
then i would go up and deliver them to these 70-year-old women playing bridge .
then when the school shut me down -- the school actually called me into the office and told me i couldn &apos;t do it -- so i went to the gas stations and i sold lots of them to the gas stations and had the gas stations sell them to their customers .
but then we negotiate on what they &apos;re going to get paid .
say , &quot; by the way , that guy &apos;s a crappy employee . &quot;
but how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well ?
so , that &apos;s a challenge , not just for organs but also for tissues .
as you age , as you get older .
then we can start to use cells .
you &apos;re going to place this in an oven-like device .
when we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient .
and instead of using ink , we use -- you just saw an inkjet cartridge -- we just use cells .
so , we stack these wafers together , using the kidney cells .
some of the work you saw today was performed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20-year time span .
kaitlyn m : i &apos;m happy . i was always afraid that i was going to have like , an accident or something .
subject matters are broken up into smaller and smaller pieces , with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure .
at the same time , all of our firepower was impotent when it came to halting or even stemming the slaughter in rwanda , darfur , myanmar .
and the point is not to treat these topics as topics of study , but as frameworks of action .
this discovery is transforming .
president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
okay , see ? it &apos;s done . it &apos;s almost done . here we go .
and the second great thing about conservatives : they get ecology .
js : there &apos;s obviously also something really deeply great about this .
now , my concern is , we dems , too often , not so much .
and we should remember who employed the sharecroppers : the democrats , right ?
but then i went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced .
openness is a commitment to a certain set of values .
but we know that &apos;s not true .
i love that term : guided mastery .
about that time he was at the d.school at stanford taking classes .
mostly you think about , am i going to survive ?
is your school or workplace divided into &quot; creatives &quot; versus practical people ? yet surely , david kelley suggests , creativity is not the domain of only a chosen few . telling stories from his legendary design career and his own life , he offers ways to build the confidence to create ... &amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ;
let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s going on in different space types in this building .
he &apos;s dedicated his life to sustainable design .
well we all know the world wide web has absolutely transformed publishing , broadcasting , commerce and social connectivity , but where did it all come from ?
and by the mid-60s , he was able to put this into action when he worked at the stanford research lab in california .
we developed a pc version of this product as well as the macintosh version .
there was a guy called gary kildall who went flying his plane when ibm came looking for an operating system for the ibm pc , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see bill gates .
i believe this is a farsi word for &quot; immortal . &quot;
which is obvious . it &apos;s a great name .
if you want to succeed you &apos;ve got to be okay to just lose control .
since i was a student , i wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in gando .
and the classroom , the ceiling is made out of both of them used together .
so we just bring them like you can see to the building site .
and my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves .
as a cyber-magician , i combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
mt : and is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ?
the odds of getting it are 4,165 to one .
it is not . it is also shaped equally by history and culture .
and what does it mean ?
let me offer you another building block to try and understand china -- maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
and the second reason is because , whereas in europe and north america , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged -- i mean in the european tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on -- for 1,000 years , the power of the chinese state has not been challenged .
so there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in china , which i suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the three gorges dam and many other expressions of state competence within china .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the g20 usurping very rapidly the position of the g7 , or the g8 .
it travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
the color of the lights indicates which sound i am playing .
in fact , i went to nashville .
&quot; big sister wong , can i sing you a song that my mom sang for me before she was swallowed in the earthquake ? &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s cool . &quot;
everyone was glued to the tv , watching disturbing , frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs -- taxi-driver , lawyer , cooks .
&quot; oh , we &apos;re actually doing an art project and we are pasting an israeli and a palestinian doing the same job .
sometimes there was no words , no sentence , just tears .
i took more photos , and we started the project .
are you an ngo ? are you the media ? &quot;
when the roofs were covered , a woman said as a joke , &quot; now god can see me . &quot;
behind each image is a story .
that &apos;s rio .
and this starts right now .
one is the recession -- that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value -- so starting to align the value with the true cost .
zipcar got some really important things right .
so for this reason , i think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that , if we squeeze hard on things that we &apos;ve thrown away , there &apos;s a lot of value in those things .
these platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of people to come with their ideas and their opportunity to create and target an application for a particular audience .
the crafty fox is this woman who &apos;s into crafts , and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around london .
the future , as we know it , is very unpredictable .
we &apos;ve seen it in the financial crisis . we &apos;ve seen it in the pandemic flu .
will only those that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future ?
an individual , for the first time in the history of humanity , will have the capacity , by 2030 , to destroy the planet , to wreck everything , through the creation , for example , of a biopathogen .
i &apos;m not on top of the class .
but , most importantly , while i was traveling , i taught children cartooning , and in exchange , i learned how to be spontaneous .
i was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after 9 / 11 .
everything had to be larger . the next painting was even bigger .
this is a work , a library i designed for the robin hood foundation .
i did that twice , and i went broke .
we had fashion designers , installation artists , models , we had makeup artists , jewelry designers , all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation .
at this point , something else happened .
i teared up and i said that &apos;s where i want to be .
and she wrote a little note , she said , &quot; hey rags , thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world . &quot;
well , bob russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level .
einstein : ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh .
e : hey , baby .
sw : very good .
e : &#91; kissing noise &#93; sw : and what do you say when it &apos;s time to go ?
a camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us .
even did lessons with olympians -- nothing helped .
then you see his left leg .
it will be an amazing experience . &quot; my first overseas experience in fact .
this is the joyo kanji . this is a tablet rather , or a poster of the 1,945 common-use characters as determined by the ministry of education in 1981 .
went in , paid my ten pesos , walked up -- 10 women two guys , usually a good ratio .
now the protectionism of argentine dance teachers aside , i found this very interesting . so i decided to focus on three of those commonalities .
this is a back step pivot .
and about five years ago , we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the u.k .
that &apos;s grown this year to about 10 .
still same is true of israel today .
and saul says , &quot; you can &apos;t fight him . that &apos;s ridiculous .
in ancient warfare , there are three kinds of warriors .
but david has absolutely no expectation .
and then there &apos;s that strange comment he makes to david : &quot; am i a dog that you should come to me with sticks ? &quot;
he sees two sticks when david has only one .
i gotta get back out my baseball ability here .
and so i started a collaboration with this person , michael zasloff and thomas fishbein , to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient .
there &apos;s a project going on at uc davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat , prevent , necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants .
but the reason i &apos;m telling you this is that the medical community , my father as an example , sometimes doesn &apos;t see what &apos;s right in front of their eyes .
so there &apos;s a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around wikipedia all over the world .
you could never afford to do this in a company .
articles on controversial topics are edited a lot , but they don &apos;t cause much controversy within the community .
and then users can set up their own personal watch list .
another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended .
down here at the bottom , &quot; keep , real movie , &quot; rick kay .
that &apos;s neo-nazi math for you .
but i think there &apos;s going to be huge impacts .
and as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon , it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow .
i am torn by your love for me .
you can &apos;t stop thinking about another human being .
last but not least , we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachment to another individual .
there &apos;s not an animal on this planet that will copulate with anything that comes along .
and there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another , that psychologists can tell you .
i think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby in front of your face , cajoling it , reprimanding it , educating it with words .
i would bring the branches home , riding buses and subways , barely holding them in my hands .
from this realization , i began to take interest in korean history , which had never inspired me before .
and they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors .
they have good vision , so they use body postures to communicate .
now , in the bahamas , we also have resident bottlenose that interact socially with the spotted dolphins .
now , dolphins are social mammals , so they love to play , and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed , or sargassum in this case , around .
here they come , and then they &apos;re going to pick up the rope and drag it around as a toy .
the computer can localize who requested the toy if there &apos;s a word match .
this is a song that i wrote about the meaning of technology , which goes perfectly with this gathering .
and sometimes he assists that with his hands , sometimes even with the leg .
those sequences were shot over the last three years in various moments of your activities .
i have 55 kilos on my back .
ultrastable profile .
so the wings have their own parachute , and you have your two parachutes .
it &apos;s sometimes possible -- it &apos;s quite complicated to explain -- but according to which regime i was , i can continue on two and try to get a nice place to land , and then i open my parachute .
it seems a little bit crazy , but it &apos;s not .
but isotopes , particles of electricity , antimatter , neutrinos , the conversion of mass to energy -- that &apos;s e = mc ^ 2 -- gamma rays , transmutation .
and that rarely , if ever , caused anything like the scientific revolution .
it was a photograph , not of space-time , but of an eclipse , with a dot there rather than there .
hades , god of the underworld , kidnaps persephone , the goddess of spring , and negotiates a forced marriage contract , requiring her to return regularly , and lets her go .
so , for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress , seek good explanations , the ones that can &apos;t be easily varied , while still explaining the phenomena .
it &apos;s a fact that is , itself , unseen , yet impossible to vary . thank you .
so -- okay , i can now see that man running out there , and i can see that guy running out there .
and on this slide , i &apos;m basically explaining all the problems you have .
and as i walked through the neighborhood , i was amazed and i was moved by the incredible sense of ownership this community clearly felt about this event .
back to back is an australian company of people with intellectual disabilities . i saw their amazing show in new york at the staten island ferry terminal at rush hour .
motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life , produced by the sequential projection of still frames , and they astonished the lumière brothers &apos; early audiences .
it &apos;s been 110 years since georges méliès sent a spaceship slamming into the eye of the man on the moon . so how far have visual effects come since then ? working closely with the academy of motion picture arts and sciences , don levy takes us on a visual journey through special effects , from the fakery of early technology to the seamless marvels of modern filmmaking .
he went through this old-growth forest and sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep .
when i worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago , we never found dead bears .
so really what the ice does is it acts like a garden .
this whale could have been born around the start of the industrial revolution .
they &apos;re not these little harbor seals .
he scolded me out , and said , &quot; this is why we &apos;re here .
i was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding , because i was crying underwater , just because it was so amazing .
i got in the water with 30 other leopard seals , and i never once had a scary encounter .
now you &apos;ve looked at them probably a few times today , but i &apos;m going to ask you a question about them .
but ironically , you can attend to something without being aware of it .
hopefully so . have a seat . there you go . you &apos;re doing well .
squeeze it tight . do you feel the poker chip in your hand ? joe : i do .
we &apos;re just shopping . this trick &apos;s more about the timing , really .
is this ? i have no idea . that &apos;s a shrimp .
africa is connecting to the rest of the world and within itself .
there are crisis maps , election maps , corruption maps , and even environmental monitoring crowd maps .
could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country ?
and the local financing is not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects .
that &apos;s the first line of defense for the body .
and grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system .
this trait also tells us a lot about politics .
but i &apos;m here today to give you a choice .
the second foundation is fairness / reciprocity .
and how will it end up being different from a kid born 60 miles south of us in lynchburg , virginia ?
notice also that on all of these graphs , the slope is steeper on in-group , authority , purity .
of course , bosch called this hell .
but i &apos;m particularly interested in religion , and the origin of religion , and in what it does to us and for us .
conservatives , on the other hand , speak for institutions and traditions .
do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil ?
psychologist jonathan haidt studies the five moral values that form the basis of our political choices , whether we &apos;re left , right or center . in this eye-opening talk , he pinpoints the moral values that liberals and conservatives tend to honor most .
this photo is actually from one of the missions in the balkans in the late 1990s .
the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine , you can start shooting at people .
victoria ? yes , correct .
they were holding something like 700 people hostage .
and she says , &quot; oh , go ahead . tase me . &quot; and so he does .
so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons , what on earth would make you think it &apos;s going to be better with military personnel ?
so makers are enthusiasts ; they &apos;re amateurs ; they &apos;re people who love doing what they do .
now this one takes a little bit of explaining .
and i found this old video .
this is jeff and bilal and several others here in a hackerspace .
one of the coolest things is , makerbot sent out an upgrade , some new brackets for the box .
it &apos;s more makers .
this is very , very glamorous : the glamour of outer space -- and not the alien-style glamour , but the nice , clean , early &apos; 60s version .
there is a process of &quot; idealization , glorification and dramatization , &quot; and it &apos;s not just the case for people .
in some sense , there has to be something like us .
there are few things more glamorous than the horizon -- except , possibly , multiple horizons .
this is the most glamorous picture , i think , ever .
we want this golden world .
it was all about cleaning up germany , and the west , and the world , and ridding it of anything unglamorous .
me was composed of stories , of cravings , of strivings , of desires of the future .
it had no limits . it was invincible .
my life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it .
in his new and visionary book , &quot; new self , new world , &quot; the writer philip shepherd says , &quot; if you are divided from your body , you are also divided from the body of the world , which then appears to be other than you or separate from you , rather than the living continuum to which you belong . &quot;
and in the name of connectedness , she said , &quot; oh , it &apos;s the gulf of mexico . &quot;
it was magic healers and aromatic oils .
and that problem is , &quot; how is it so easy to know other minds ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you a five-year-old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task .
rs : yeah , you think he &apos;s going to take that one ? all right . let &apos;s see .
um , yeah .
and we can compare that to another case , where everything in the real world is the same .
woman : ready , rebecca ? rs : yes .
rs : yeah , we worry about this .
that &apos;s a great answer . rebecca saxe , thank you very much . that was fantastic .
and sometimes it takes a wake-up call , doesn &apos;t it , to alert us to the fact that we &apos;re hurrying through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we &apos;re living the fast life , instead of the good life .
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nub of the question , which is how we think about time itself .
and in this , towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape , so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another .
it &apos;s not just , though , these days , adults who overwork , though , is it ? it &apos;s children , too .
are politicians making good decisions on my behalf ?
i no longer hear time &apos;s winged chariot drawing near , or at least not as much as i did before .
how do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person ?
and when there were complaints about budget , i said , &quot; well , it &apos;s worth doing the island because you get twice for your money : reflections . &quot;
and i went down and chief minister badal said to me , &quot; we sikhs have suffered a great deal , as you have jews .
just cut the whole museum through the mountain -- enter from one side of the mountain , come out on the other side of the mountain -- and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers .
and so it goes .
and one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future , or the past .
he &apos;ll play it . i don &apos;t know how we &apos;ll react to it , but something will change .
when you do that , you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more , and gradually it builds .
madame , would you like some of those orange bangles with the pink polka dots ?
and for many of us , our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid . thank you .
in sri lanka , if you go down to the south coast of sri lanka , during the northeast monsoon season , you can see blue whales very , very easily .
they lay the eggs into fresh water .
because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell .
another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains , the rainwater soaks down into the soil . so , it &apos;s gone .
you &apos;d think they &apos;re coming from india . it &apos;s the closest place .
it &apos;s about five kilometers around , counting the dragonflies as i go , trying not to bump into people as i &apos;m looking in the trees .
i know that because i have friends who work on fisheries &apos; research vessels who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean .
the wind will swoosh them out across here .
it &apos;s only half the length of this one .
and then they strike out across the ocean , down to kenya .
charles anderson : dragonflies that fly across oceans
you have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes . i had all that stuff , and it &apos;s gone .
a little indulgent , i understand .
but there &apos;s this other aspect of it for wheelies , so check this out . there &apos;s a few tricks , again , how environment changes the nature of your tricks .
i should say this . there &apos;s some sort of beautiful symmetry that the degree to which we connect to a community is in proportion to our individuality , which we are expressing by what we do .
what is it that will punch you and make you do something and bring it to another level , and when you &apos;ve had it all , sometimes , guys , they die on the vine with all of that talent , and one of the things we &apos;ve had , all of us , is fame , i think the best kind of fame , because you can take it off .
it &apos;s a real pleasure to be here .
the bombsights that were available were incredibly crude .
and they trained 50,000 bombardiers on how to use them -- long extensive , months-long training sessions -- because these things are essentially analog computers ; they &apos;re not easy to use .
and then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the norden bombsight was , there was a famous case in 1944 where the allies bombed a chemical plant in leuna , germany .
and after the war was over , there was an audit done -- as the army always does , the air force always does -- and they asked the question : how many scuds did we actually destroy ?
as we have gotten more and more efficient in killing them , they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us .
you know , i guess the first question is , why build a virtual world at all ?
why do we as people want to do that ?
you know , you know when you see it . you know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you can &apos;t .
and i think that &apos;s something that people have talked about for 20 years -- you know , that 3d , that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us .
that idea of infinite possibility , that magic of anything can happen , only happens in an environment where you really know that there &apos;s a fundamental freedom at the level of the individual actor , at the level of the lego blocks , if you will , that make up the virtual world .
you can have a baby in second life .
it doesn &apos;t seem to have its own culture , and the sort of differences that exist in the real world aren &apos;t translated into the second life map .
they tend to be creative . they tend to be entrepreneurial .
so this change , i believe , is a huge disruptive change .
as a frenchman , i must say that there are a lot of french intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting .
it is something that -- changes of nature .
even joy -- that can be the spring of happiness .
and also , they are detrimental to others &apos; happiness .
so that &apos;s the way to proceed . rejoicing compared to jealousy .
so can we do that with human qualities ?
here , the -0.5 is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion .
and jumping monks of tibet .
when did we originate as a species ?
well , historically , it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology .
human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30 , 40 years ago -- carlton coon is the best example -- had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-darwinian era -- for over a million years , since the time of homo erectus .
a haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes -- a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length .
and what that means is that we originated in africa . it &apos;s written in our dna .
lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types , oxygen isotopes and so on .
the tool styles don &apos;t change that much .
the changes that allowed us to do that , the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us , allowing us to create novel cultures , allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one i &apos;ve just been on .
how often do you get to participate in a big scientific project ?
an egg is a beautiful , sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things , such as chickens .
so let &apos;s do it .
recent studies by satellites such as the wmap satellite have shown that , in fact , there are just tiny differences in that background .
living organisms are created by chemistry .
you don &apos;t stabilize the individual ; you stabilize the template , the thing that carries information , and you allow the template to copy itself .
humans appeared about 200,000 years ago .
and then from about 500 years ago , humans began to link up globally through shipping , through trains , through telegraph , through the internet , until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals .
i &apos;m going to talk today about saving more , but not today , tomorrow .
i see a lot of hands coming down .
they &apos;re just too lazy .
wonderful .
well , you still have choice .
one group of monkeys gets an apple , they &apos;re pretty happy .
now we also talked about checking the box and the difficulty of taking action .
by now , about 60 percent of the large companies actually have programs like this in place .
you &apos;re older than you &apos;ve ever been and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re even older . you &apos;re older than you &apos;ve even been and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re older still . time is marching on and time is still marching on . this day will soon be at an end and now it &apos;s even sooner and now it &apos;s even sooner and now it &apos;s even sooner . this day will soon be at an end and now it &apos;s even sooner and now it &apos;s sooner still . you &apos;re older than you &apos;ve ever been and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re even older . you &apos;re older than you &apos;ve ever been and now you &apos;re even older and now you &apos;re older still . thank you very much .
it &apos;s based on a real life experience .
eleanor , i &apos;m sorry , do you have a laminated badge ?
and here was the introduction of this great british icon called &quot; elizabeth . &quot;
so i &apos;m looking for those moments , and i &apos;m standing there and saying , &quot; i don &apos;t know what to say . &quot;
khota &apos;s now become a bad word . it means their terrace -- and we used to sleep out at night .
we are the stories we tell ourselves .
what is wonderful is , at many times , the stories will contradict with each other .
the writer said &quot; it &apos;s about history , plot . &quot;
is it his ?
the camera &apos;s looking down at her because she &apos;s in the well .
and the rich people moved to the upper city and left the poorer people in the lower cities , about 10 to 12 percent of the people have moved to the upper city .
in a poet &apos;s mind , it &apos;s a conflict of words , in the universe &apos;s mind , between day and night .
but do they call me macgregor the stone wall builder ? no . &quot;
and the most current story lesson that i &apos;ve had was completing the film i &apos;ve just done this year in 2012 .
that &apos;s your job as a storyteller , is to hide the fact that you &apos;re making them work for their meal .
i took to this like a duck to water .
but more importantly , have you made me want to know how it will all conclude in the long-term ?
woody : what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
i could just tell there was a grand design under it -- in every shot , every scene , every line .
wonder is honest , it &apos;s completely innocent .
it means capturing a truth from your experiencing it , expressing values you personally feel deep down in your core .
he said , &quot; what can i do to save the rainforests ? &quot;
i often talk to refugees : &quot; why was it that the west didn &apos;t realize that famines are caused by policies and politics , not by weather ? &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about lifestyles .
the average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the u.s .
we need oxford to work with cambridge .
and if you go through the first 25 or 30 names of each of the commodities , what you begin to see is , gosh , there &apos;s cargill here , there &apos;s cargill there , there &apos;s cargill everywhere .
it can happen .
buy it .
the issue isn &apos;t what to think , it &apos;s how to think .
but how to make it happen ?
immediately , the paralyzed rat can stand .
in fact -- thank you .
this is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury , but i begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people &apos;s quality of life .
for nothing in my life &apos;s path would have predicted that i &apos;d be standing here as the first african-american first lady of the united states of america .
and when we first met , one of the things that i remember is that he took me out on a date .
the difference between a struggling family and a healthy one is often the presence of an empowered woman or women at the center of that family .
that is true . that is the reality of the world that we live in .
in august 2007 , claron was awarded the amsterdam prize for the arts , winning praise for her brilliance , her amazing and extensively wide repertoire and her vivid stage personality .
no notes , no flats , no sharps .
it &apos;s not better public transportation .
because the fur-to-wingspan ratio of the bumblebee is far too large for it to be able to fly .
so , for example , last year , the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube .
and they came together to help find the problem and fix it .
it &apos;s reminiscent of the description of history as &quot; one damn thing after another , &quot; right ?
you could see arguments on both sides .
but then you hit this one . image removed at request of owner .
no . i think the actual answer is that once you reframe it , once you get out of one set of stale expectations from a failed project that had its day , but now , for whatever reason , is tarnished , you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing that something like this on craigslist represents .
so in the &apos; 60s , the u.s. was first .
but i want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture .
the red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country &apos;s wealth .
and remember , germany , we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees .
it didn &apos;t change its economy . it didn &apos;t change the compositions of its population .
in the past , different students were taught in similar ways .
you &apos;ve seen finland doing so well on pisa , but what makes finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools .
i &apos;ll just take you to bangladesh for a minute .
it empowers authorities , without activating the citizens -- their hands , legs , brains , what have you .
and if that &apos;s the case , then the question is how many telephones did we have at that time ?
but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area .
see , you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing .
i created a company in america called gonofone , which in bengali means &quot; people &apos;s phone . &quot;
and actually , private companies help governments with taxes .
the course was good , but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset .
that was the year when queen victoria was able , for the first time , to communicate with president buchanan , through the transatlantic telegraphic cable .
look here , 1858 , india was here , china was here , japan was there , united states and united kingdom was richer over there .
and we are moving into the new world .
and they go quite closely together , and you can see that the similarity with india and china , in many ways , are greater than the differences with them .
and i can understand him , because washington , d.c .
the bubbles , not my bubbles , but the financial bubbles .
but what i &apos;m really worried about is war .
we know it &apos;s there by its gravitational effects .
so all of these galaxies are moving .
so a ray of light could go down , be bent up into the observer &apos;s eye , and the observer sees a ray of light here .
ok , so the question is : do we see this in the sky ?
they &apos;re not necessarily moving through space .
so by looking at things like clusters of galaxies , and how they -- their number density , how many there are as a function of time -- we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming .
so in terms of the big questions : what is dark matter ? what is dark energy ?
i thought this was unacceptable . so i decided to do something about it .
but there was one interesting anecdote that i found in indonesia .
you probably know that roughly 25 million people in africa are infected with the virus , that aids is a disease of poverty , and that if we can bring africa out of poverty , we would decrease aids as well .
so if we look in this particularly high-risk sample , they &apos;re being asked , &quot; did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months ? &quot;
and the way that i &apos;m going to do that is , i &apos;m going to look across areas with different levels of malaria .
and a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past .
botswana is a place with a lot of aids , egypt is a place without a lot of aids .
it &apos;s good for improving people &apos;s lives .
there was a big decline in coffee prices .
emily oster re-examines the stats on aids in africa from an economic perspective and reaches a stunning conclusion : everything we know about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
and most people knock them down when they &apos;re small .
so the engineer &apos;s boss said , &quot; find a way to quiet this train . &quot;
and those bumps act like a magnet for water .
and then we wonder why the membrane clogs and why it takes so much electricity .
nature has been doing that for a long time .
mit just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips .
and that information will go into asknature.org .
what motivated me to film their behavior was something that i asked my scientific advisers : &quot; what motivates the pollinators ? &quot;
i &apos;m a product of this visionary mother and father .
out of 100 , 90 are your creation .
and i redefined policing concepts in india .
they saw me as a young , short woman wearing a pathan suit .
that &apos;s the second landmark .
i &apos;m currently into movements , movements of education of the under-served children , which is thousands -- india is all about thousands .
but then i started feeling bad .
but since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
i &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
so i posed this question to him : how can we get 100 million people translating the web into every major language for free ?
so now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
and as you get more and more advanced , we give you more and more complex sentences to translate .
now the thing that i &apos;m most excited about with duolingo is i think this provides a fair business model for language education .
buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors .
and not just easy things that anyone can do .
the cars are completely insured during the rental , and it gives drivers what they need , and what do they need ?
so what &apos;s happening is , we had the yuck side , but we actually had this real wow side .
we live longer . we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago .
you &apos;ve probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present . &quot; be here now , &quot; you &apos;ve probably heard a hundred times .
maybe that &apos;s what &apos;s really going on . how could we ever disentangle these two possibilites ?
the early 70s marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in ghana .
and i realized that , when i &apos;d left the country , free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream .
we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets .
the electoral commissioner declared , with the consent of the parties , to run an unprecedented second re-run .
it was called -- it was called &quot; the air pump , &quot; or something like &quot; the leviathan and the air pump . &quot;
but both started exploring it .
and like , there was big arguments about it in the -- you know , the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff .
and most the demonstrations had to do with visuals .
i mean , individuals own things that kings would have definitely gone to war to get .
i may not care about the fact that it &apos;s prohibited from heating this solution .
and it was -- i was following all the rules .
and no tricky shit behind the thing . i mean , it &apos;s all -- you &apos;ve got to be very honest with what you &apos;re doing if it really is going to work .
there is nothing in their contract , in fact , that makes it to their advantage always , to tell you the truth .
and those two papers came out in science magazine , february the first , and these -- the conclusion in both of these papers , and in also the science editor &apos;s , like , descriptions of these papers , for , you know , for the quickie , is that our theories about global warming are completely wrong . i mean , what these guys were doing , and this is what -- the nasa people have been saying this for a long time .
so the planet is a pretty amazing thing , you know , it &apos;s big and horrible -- and big and wonderful , and it does all kinds of things we don &apos;t know anything about .
this was really an extraordinary advance , because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells , which still remain the gold standard , they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery .
it doesn &apos;t work with shoes , and our bodies are many times more complicated than just our feet .
susan solomon : the promise of research with stem cells
so i wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces , and the simplest way to do it , at the time , was to model myself .
there &apos;s nobody around you , and you hear the kids playing in the park above you , completely unaware of what &apos;s underneath .
after exploring recently-abandoned buildings , i felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast : your home , your office , a shopping mall , a church -- any man-made structures around you .
it was built in the early 1500s .
this is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year .
the mass of this comes out of the air .
by extension , we think to ourselves , &quot; why it &apos;s hotter in summer than in winter must be because we &apos;re closer to the sun . &quot;
and the reason it &apos;s like that is because it &apos;s dead boring to have a load of concentric circles , whereas that &apos;s much more exciting , to look at something at that angle , isn &apos;t it ? right ? and by doing it at that angle , if you &apos;ve got that misconception in your head , then that two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses .
ok ? we collude , and actually if you -- if someone had designed a test for me when i was doing my biology exams , to really understand , to see whether i &apos;d understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue , and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air , then i might have done better at science .
i love things that are alive .
but when i saw this , i was really fascinated , because it seemed lifelike .
and we also have to be aware of the issues .
we somehow got to proteins and dna .
but that &apos;s probably going to end in failure , so we need to be a bit more focused .
and this movie here shows this competition between molecules .
the real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything , because it &apos;s a multidimensional problem put there by evolution .
lc : hopefully within the next two years .
and there &apos;s not even statistics on africa to know what is happening . &quot;
but that &apos;s too complicated for today , so i &apos;ll simplify it for you , and i give you one average point for each survey .
they have 2.4 percent .
still here , child death per 1,000 on that axis .
and here we got better education , and we got health service , and child mortality came down .
we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill .
this is the vision we have , isn &apos;t it .
it &apos;s very clear that this is what happens .
well , you are to ride a bicycle , carrying your own weight and also some other weight , so that you can earn the bread for the day .
and then he said , &quot; well , i must give them a car that they can afford , one lakh car , $ 2,000 car . &quot;
and they did innovation in design and beyond .
and british motor was around 11,000 .
you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
what &apos;s happening in the area of health ?
looks absolutely ridiculous .
you cannot say it &apos;s a mere treatment 10,000 dollars , but because you are poor i &apos;ll give it for 9,000 .
and that is why the message is that of gandhian engineering .
and then the paper burned .
i &apos;ve always had a fascination for computers and technology , and i made a few apps for the iphone , ipod touch , and ipad .
i &apos;m fortunate enough to be part of one .
this is between 50 and 100 megawatts .
and these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees celsius , which means the higher the temperature you go to , thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies .
so the core of this reactor , since it &apos;s not under pressure and it doesn &apos;t have this chemical reactivity , means that there &apos;s no inclination for the fission products to leave this reactor .
and i &apos;ll just say one more maybe philosophical thing to end with , which is weird for a scientist .
what happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person -- that &apos;s exactly what they need at this moment in time ?
now , there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience , but even that is a matter of degree , not kind .
because there is a basic paradox : no one can have an inauthentic experience , but no business can supply one .
fact is , there &apos;s a general rule : if you don &apos;t like it , it &apos;s fake ; if you do like it , it &apos;s faux .
and what you have done in the past limits what you can do , what you can get away with , essentially , in the future .
right ? it &apos;s beans ; right ? it &apos;s coffee beans .
so perfectly organized a structure , it was hard not to attribute divinity to it .
within five weeks , you can start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles .
i &apos;m going to show you many different kinds of pieces , and there &apos;s no real connection between one or the other , except that they sort of come out of my brain , and they &apos;re all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by looking at life , and seeing nature and seeing objects , and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things .
and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point .
now , this is a funny sort of conceptual thing , and yesterday we were talking about danny hillis &apos; &quot; 10,000 year clock . &quot;
after many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers , i made that tool , and then i made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly -- sort of developing my own little world of technology .
it means nothing at all .
because i &apos;ve noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars .
and if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source , you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines .
perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars .
it &apos;s very complicated . i don &apos;t really want you to try to understand what is here .
how to measure , if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small , so those planets are tectonically dead , there cannot be life .
you can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far , far , far from solar system .
it will take about five years .
i was like , &quot; really ? &quot; and he was like , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what underpinned this shame , this &quot; i &apos;m not good enough , &quot; -- which we all know that feeling : &quot; i &apos;m not blank enough . i &apos;m not thin enough , rich enough , beautiful enough , smart enough , promoted enough . &quot;
what &apos;s the theme ? what &apos;s the pattern ?
and i had to put my data away and go find a therapist .
and it took about a year .
i &apos;m going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin .
which just , i hope in 100 years , people will look back and go , &quot; wow . &quot;
brené brown : the power of vulnerability
i just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor .
so , if we want to act more effectively in the world , we have to get to know ourselves better .
but it &apos;s a story until we convert it to data and so what we do , this concept we had , was to take steven &apos;s status , &quot; what is my status ? &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you what patients like me , the company that myself , my youngest brother and a good friend from mit started .
i want to talk to the 58 patients down here who are taking four milligrams a day .
i don &apos;t want to just look at this cool device , i want to take this data and make something even better .
now , we &apos;ll skip the critiques of the paper .
and i said , &quot; what if we built a time machine for patients , except instead of going backwards , we go forwards .
terrifyingly accurate matching .
because something went different .
that same word , &quot; normal , &quot; had two different , almost opposite meanings .
one of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look and act very differently .
the power plant of tomorrow is no power plant .
it &apos;s been a long time in coming for me .
the second quote is from the head of the u.k. financial services authority .
well , it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction .
now you may think that no one &apos;s looked at this before because ownership networks are really , really boring to study .
well , ownership gives voting rights to shareholders .
what should you take home from all of this ?
more than one third of the world &apos;s crop production is dependent on bee pollination .
and even stranger , there were these people , these beekeepers , that loved their bees like they were family , and when i put down the book , i knew i had to see this for myself .
the bottom line is , bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape and a dysfunctional food system .
recently , researchers from penn state university have started looking at the pesticide residue in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food , and they &apos;ve found that every batch of pollen that a honeybee collects has at least six detectable pesticides in it , and this includes every class of insecticides , herbicides , fungicides , and even inert and unlabeled ingredients that are part of the pesticide formulation that can be more toxic than the active ingredient .
we need all of our bees .
maria spivak : yeah .
we bury them in the ground .
they had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched .
this is another part , single strand , dipped in a bigger tank that self-folds into a cube , a three-dimensional structure , on its own .
3d printing has grown in sophistication since the late 1970s ; fellow skylar tibbits is shaping the next development , which he calls 4d printing , where the fourth dimension is time . this emerging technology will allow us to print objects that then reshape themselves or self-assemble over time . think : a printed cube that folds before your eyes , or a printed pipe able to sense the need to expand or contract .
when i first started talking about this research outside of academia , out with companies and schools , the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph .
the reason this graph is important to me is , when i turn on the news , it seems like the majority of the information is not positive , in fact it &apos;s negative .
and when they see this , they say , &quot; shawn , why do you waste your time studying happiness at harvard ?
and the problem is it &apos;s scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons .
and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies , what we &apos;ve found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success , and in doing so , not only create ripples of positivity , but create a real revolution .
a bad sort of branding thing , or whatever .
and then luckily , you know , i had the fortune of going to something called a library , and in the library i came upon this very book .
it took a month to make this part .
and then someone discovered this &quot; a-ha moment &quot; where you could use coordinate systems .
i did this ad . i don &apos;t believe in this kind of alcohol , but i do drink sometimes .
the computer lives in so many dimensions .
i began to make led sculptures that would live inside little boxes out of mdf .
i began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square .
it &apos;s about how to make it more humane again .
now there is another side to this .
but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can &apos;t roughhouse on the playground today .
the next reason that boys &apos; cultures are out of sync with school cultures : there are fewer male teachers .
and if you ask title 1 teachers , they &apos;ll tell you they &apos;ve got about four or five boys for every girl that &apos;s in their program , in the elementary grades .
so we need to design better games .
they are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything .
we will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe , and to explain my point , let me first tell you what the higgs is about , and to do so , we have to go back to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the big bang .
in the same way , a bubble of the ultra-dense higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling .
in about five billion years , our sun will become a red giant , as large as the earth &apos;s orbit , and our earth will be kaput , and in a thousand billion years , if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate , you will not even be able to see as far as your toes , because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light .
that &apos;s how physics works : a single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley .
this is a piece called blend , and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art .
but we haven &apos;t yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really , truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we &apos;re comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that , i don &apos;t know about you , but i really enjoy spending time in .
fortunately , necessity remains the mother of invention , and a lot of the design work that we &apos;re the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic , to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you &apos;re flying or the wheels on the ground , to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we &apos;ll see in a moment , to crash safety features .
so despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary , we really focused on doing as little new as possible .
it also continues to be a fabulous adventure .
indeed , it is discouraging .
how are you going to manage it ?
with respect to idea drawings , nowhere in the contract is the word &quot; cartoon &quot; mentioned .
basically , that &apos;s the way humor works .
office worker : smoked turkey with bacon ? bm : no .
it &apos;s rude . the world really shouldn &apos;t be that way .
that &apos;s a cartoon about terrorism .
humor does need a target .
this is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog .
but , actually , it &apos;s suddenly come to me after years working in the business , that what we create in advertising , which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value , you might call it badge value , subjective value , intangible value of some kind -- gets rather a bad rap .
so , welcome to oxford , ladies and gentlemen .
he made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil .
because actually , never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry . this actually had symbolic value , badge value .
this is actually what &apos;s called , in the digital world , &quot; user-generated content . &quot;
yet we &apos;ve never created the opportunity for impulse saving .
but it &apos;s kind of like flipping a six or a nine . like a six , if you flip it over it looks like a nine .
advertising adds value to a product by changing our perception , rather than the product itself . rory sutherland makes the daring assertion that a change in perceived value can be just as satisfying as what we consider &quot; real &quot; value -- and his conclusion has interesting consequences for how we look at life .
i started to learn classic ballet , jazz dance , acrobatics and other things to make my performance better .
susan blackmore : someone says no , very loudly , from over there .
sb : no , not without .
information that we copy from person to person , by imitation , by language , by talking , by telling stories , by wearing clothes , by doing things .
all the stories that we &apos;re telling -- well , of course , ted is a great meme-fest , masses of memes .
some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker .
this is why , in &quot; the meme machine , &quot; i called it memetic drive .
we &apos;ll think we &apos;re choosing these things , but the temes are making us do it .
because every step is dangerous .
has it been tried before ?
we make new ones , and so it &apos;s convenient to piggyback on us , because we &apos;re not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable .
this is the national palace -- the equivalent of the white house .
that is 500 times the power of the 7.0 that hit port-au-prince -- 500 times the power , yet only under a thousand casualties .
for all the disaster , there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation , so that when the next earthquake hits , it is a disaster -- but not a tragedy .
you wouldn &apos;t think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another .
and if you have just the wall with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension , you &apos;ve got a little wet rag .
it &apos;s a model skeleton that i made out of a piece of cloth that i wrapped around an inflated balloon .
so it &apos;ll be made of the same cotton cloth , same balloon , same internal pressure .
do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your band-aid off slowly -- you take a long time , but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach ?
but at the end of this process , what i learned was that the nurses were wrong .
now , in economic theory , cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis .
so , we got people to the lab , and we said , &quot; we have two tasks for you today . &quot;
think about the following intuition .
what would happen to the other people in the group ?
of course they would .
we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things -- our own ability , how the economy works , how we should pay school teachers .
you get services , like reddit and wordpress are actually accepting bitcoin as a payment currency now .
loyalty essentially is a micro-economy .
in mexico , nike has run a campaign recently called , literally , bid your sweat .
is technology making paper money feel outmoded ?
mom and dad raised beef cattle , and i &apos;m the oldest boy .
i starts out with a slow air .
it became the only piano in the region , and mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived , she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms . anyway , we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back home . we purchased it .
okay .
self-study , self-exploration , self-empowerment : these are the virtues of a great education .
for example , pramode c.e. , an engineer from kerala , india , has organized groups of self-learners who build our computer under his good guidance .
so we collect your b pluses and your a minuses and we aggregate them into a number like 3.4 , which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are .
the driving force behind this project is my colleague shmulik london , and , you see , just like salman did about 90 years ago , the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people , because at the end , it &apos;s all about people .
it is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts .
it is time to be asking questions about technology .
your mobile phone , computer and game console have a bloody past — tied to tantalum mining , which funds the war in the democratic republic of the congo . drawing on his personal story , activist and refugee bandi mbubi gives a stirring call to action .
they &apos;ve all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings .
she can go to airbnb to list her sofa bed , she can go to taskrabbit.com and say , &quot; i want to do local deliveries , &quot; and so on .
and for that they have to be able to access state-of-the-art markets .
it &apos;s about enshrining government &apos;s role as a publicist for these markets .
this kind of data can become routine .
i photographed her before and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl , issa .
and as a child you &apos;re always worried about resource .
okay . what is fusion ? here comes the nuclear physics .
if you can get something to about 150 million degrees , things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration , this will happen , and it will release energy .
and breeder technology is fast breeders . and that &apos;s pretty dangerous .
this is the device we &apos;re building now .
so in 2011 , power shifted , from the few to the many , from oval offices to central squares , from carefully guarded airwaves to open-source networks .
it was also people &apos;s deep longing for freedom .
i was meeting with a group of newly-elected parliamentarians from egypt and tunisia a couple of weeks ago .
they were doctors and dissidents , artists and organizers .
i think it might be a lifeline .
it &apos;s my dad . are you there ? &quot;
in fact , the year after the nypd put compstat in place , the murder rate fell 60 percent .
because when you ask it , you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you , how it keeps us from attempting great things , and life gets dull , amazing things stop happening .
since we took to the sky , we have wanted to fly faster and farther .
you can &apos;t learn to fly at mach 20 unless you fly .
one square millimeter of a gecko &apos;s footpad has 14,000 hair-like structures called setae .
that moment mattered to tim and katie , and this green goo may someday matter to you .
they remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure .
and when he hit send , he probably didn &apos;t realize what a difference it would make .
like what &apos;s the payload it could carry ?
it &apos;s just the nature of what we do .
they pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there .
and also , for me , biking is a matter of empowerment .
but that &apos;s one reason why they ended up where they were .
why don &apos;t you rest for a few minutes and then we &apos;ll go on . &quot;
all you have to do is play with it , change it a little bit , and come up with something that does help , that does work .
and at the end of each ride , we sit together and share moments in which those special words of the day popped up and made a difference , and these discussions can be extremely inspiring .
embracing otherness .
but nature had its wicked way , and brown babies were born .
i can hardly find the words to describe the peace i felt when i was acting .
i still believed my self was all i was .
i stopped giving it so much authority .
thandie newton : embracing otherness , embracing myself
but they aren &apos;t in london .
in the news , the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time .
so people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area , and use that height that we have to have for its function .
so we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds , some kind of seed cathedral .
and inside there &apos;s nothing ; there &apos;s no famous actor &apos;s voice ; there &apos;s no projections ; there &apos;s no televisions ; there &apos;s no color changing .
and by linking these together , we could have 90 percent of the site as a rainforest , instead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings .
here are a few quotes indicating that : &quot; man has no nature , &quot; from the historian jose ortega y gasset ; &quot; man has no instincts , &quot; from the anthropologist ashley montagu ; &quot; the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none , &quot; from the late scientist stephen jay gould .
now -- the story might seem to good to be true , but when you administer batteries of psychological tests , you get the same results -- namely , identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities .
but what i wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the 80-odd reviews that the blank slate has received .
in literary criticism and analysis , probably 40 or 50 years ago , literary critics were a kind of cultural hero ; now they &apos;re kind of a national joke .
well , this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book .
so let me conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choices .
and they said , &quot; the band is applied to the tail , tightly .
now you think you know what &apos;s coming , michael -- you don &apos;t , ok ?
he goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands .
the testicles emerge -- they look like thumbs , coming right at you -- and he says , &quot; bite &apos; em .
i got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
and now , when i talk about the show , i no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it .
matt froind , a dairy farmer in new canaan , connecticut , who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk , if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots .
but he looked at me , and he said , &quot; son &quot; -- he &apos;s my age , by the way , he calls me son , i love that -- he says , &quot; son , i &apos;m a captain of a crab boat .
i mean , so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
i didn &apos;t know which of these things was true , but i thought it was kind of interesting .
and i got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center , which is where you get to meet the patients .
he said , &quot; oh , yeah . i told the psychiatrist that i wanted to watch women as they died because it would make me feel more normal . &quot;
so only in broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness .
it could be carnage by the end of the night .
&quot; you &apos;ve got more sharks and you &apos;ve got tigers . &quot;
so he was going down the psychopathic checklist , basically turning it into &quot; who moved my cheese ? &quot;
he said , &quot; you know what , one of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse , but another item on the checklist is cunning , manipulative .
because you shouldn &apos;t define people by their maddest edges .
now , the reason i begin by saying &quot; no 9 / 11 , no war &quot; is that we have to acknowledge that islam , as interpreted by a very , very small , extremely radical group of people , was a precipitating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- the precipitating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- and as a consequence , at one degree of remove , the precipitating cause of the coming war that we &apos;re about to be engaged in .
well , so says george w. bush .
that &apos;s an academic question .
that may be a good thing , in light of some of the criticisms we &apos;ve heard today -- for example , in the regulatory context -- of what democracy produces .
and when i first learned about endangered species , i was truly distressed to know that every day animals were being wiped off the face of this earth forever .
and last week , a 10 year-old girl asked me , &quot; what did it feel like when you first walked into that building and saw so many oiled penguins ? &quot;
and there really were no good solutions .
so in a panic , estelle from sanccob called the student and said , &quot; please , you have to make more . &quot;
and simply put , if penguins are dying , it means our oceans are dying , and we ultimately will be affected , because , as sylvia earle says , &quot; the oceans are our life-support system . &quot;
so , three and a half years ago , a few of us sat around a kitchen table and we just invented the whole thing .
they said , &quot; absolutely fine , provided you get planning permission and you do it in latin and you do it in triplicate , &quot; so we did — — and now there are fruit trees and bushes and herbs and vegetables around that doctor &apos;s surgery .
and then , we had a chat with the farmers , and we said , &quot; we &apos;re really serious about this , &quot; but they didn &apos;t actually believe us , so we thought , okay , what should we do ? i know . if we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product , maybe they &apos;ll change their mind and see we &apos;re serious .
suddenly , we &apos;re seeing actions on the ground from local government . we &apos;re seeing this mainstreamed .
this went down very well in the u.k. , where religion is extremely unpopular .
why ? because in compassion , when we feel with the other , we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there . and once we get rid of ego , then we &apos;re ready to see the divine .
the causes of our present woes are political .
with the mosque , with the synagogue , saying , &quot; we must start to speak to one another . &quot;
i was part of that united nations initiative called the alliance of civilizations , which was asked by kofi annan to diagnose the causes of extremism , and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism .
if you take some heart cells from an animal , and put it in a dish , they &apos;ll just sit there and beat .
but when you look closer at this , look at what &apos;s there .
so nasa wanted me to take some pictures of moon sand , so they sent me sand from all the different landings of the apollo missions that happened 40 years ago .
so , 120 years ago , dr. röntgen x-rayed his wife &apos;s hand .
fashion -- now , i &apos;m sort of anti-fashion because i don &apos;t show the surface , i show what &apos;s within .
seaweed , ebbing in the tide .
and i sent them back an x-ray .
the thing in there is very dangerous .
not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye , the way the leaves form . they &apos;re curling back on each other .
so , i &apos;ve got to saw the car in half , down the middle , not an easy task , in itself .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week , and after a week , they only used it as a bathroom .
but it &apos;s not gone .
no , i just spit out a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
you , i imagine , can do much better things with your time .
what is that idea ?
because in that moment , there &apos;s no mark by tony &apos;s name ; it &apos;s just the two of us standing there .
and apparently it &apos;s being remade right now and it &apos;s going to be coming out next year .
the same is again true with information .
jp rangaswami : information is food
but does it just happen over there ?
he used one to buy the property , and another , which was in somebody else &apos;s name , to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place .
now many of these companies were in america or the united kingdom , its overseas territories and crown dependencies , and so it &apos;s not just an offshore problem , it &apos;s an on-shore one too .
after many months of digging around and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents , we found evidence that , in fact , shell and eni had known that the funds would be transferred to that shell company , and frankly , it &apos;s hard to believe they didn &apos;t know who they were really dealing with there .
i began &quot; the vagina monologues &quot; because i was worried about vaginas .
you cling to your land because it is your secure place .
i &apos;ve been with girls all across america who were date-raped , or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night .
as a result , this production , which had already sold out , every single person in that 800-seat audience , except for 10 people , made a decision to keep the money .
when she began her mission eight years ago , she was reviled , she was detested , she was completely slandered in her community .
and i think as long as i keep grieving , and weeping , and then moving on , i &apos;m fine .
soon , it had occurred to me what my job was .
now , luckily for me , i live and work in new york city , where there are plenty of dinosaurs .
for me , it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of .
all right , so i got a collection of the paintings together and i looked at them and i deconstructed them and i put them back together .
when it &apos;s on top of the paper board , which is the opposite , it forms this .
so , as you can see evidenced by such examples , age has absolutely nothing to do with it .
the reality , unfortunately , is a little different , and it has a lot to do with trust , or a lack of it .
or just like you ? really ?
the first is the geophony , or the nonbiological sounds that occur in any given habitat , like wind in the trees , water in a stream , waves at the ocean shore , movement of the earth .
and you can see that the signature of a stream is represented here in the bottom third or half of the page , while birds that were once in that meadow are represented in the signature across the top .
mono lake is just to the east of yosemite national park in california , and it &apos;s a favorite habitat of these toads , and it &apos;s also favored by u.s. navy jet pilots , who train in their fighters flying them at speeds exceeding 1,100 kilometers an hour and altitudes only a couple hundred meters above ground level of the mono basin , very fast , very low , and so loud that the anthrophony , the human noise , even though it &apos;s six and a half kilometers from the frog pond you just heard a second ago , it masked the sound of the chorusing toads .
bernie krause has been recording wild soundscapes -- the wind in the trees , the chirping of birds , the subtle sounds of insect larvae -- for 45 years . in that time , he has seen many environments radically altered by humans , sometimes even by practices thought to be environmentally safe . a surprising look at what we can learn through nature &apos;s symphonies , from the grunting of a sea anemone to the sad calls of a beaver in mourning .
and -- you see the picture at the bottom ?
i personally preferred the spanish version , which was &quot; tortugas ninja . &quot;
the game costs about 80 million dollars to make , so basically it pays for itself in about a month .
but what i want you to do is to try to understand it .
in the year of my birth the nintendo entertainment system also went into development .
i have come to expect this level of interaction .
as gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life , only virtually .
i found that video very , very thought provoking , and that &apos;s why i wanted to bring it here for you guys to see .
and i &apos;ve been asking myself , what is emma going to experience in the video game world ?
it &apos;s trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what &apos;s there . &quot;
and in fact , what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature -- of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar -- all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish , and they &apos;re in violent motion .
and what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project , and then something like science .
so what if i click this down to zero ?
ak : stopwatches aren &apos;t accurate enough .
yeah , there we go . yeah , ok ?
i think that shakespeare really put it very nicely .
and this is very critical stuff .
but who is going to pay for all this ?
the second is modifying our emotions .
as that becomes possible this is going to move from something that is used by those who have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization , to the wealthy who want to protect their children , to just about everybody else .
people can try and ban these things .
so we shouldn &apos;t dismiss this because it &apos;s an enormous opportunity to use these sorts of results , or these random loose trials from the last thousand years about what has impacts on our health .
i think that we should be proud of it .
and i thought , &quot; okay , here we go . &quot;
&quot; human males and females develop a special bond , and when they &apos;re much older , much , much older than you , and they have a very special feeling , then they can be naked together . &quot;
i don &apos;t understand the legs . &quot;
everyone in here will be between 3.2 and 3.6 cm .
you can see , it &apos;s quite a complex structure .
i don &apos;t take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that i would choose to take .
and the very first cad model we made , the surgeons were playing with the plastic model , couldn &apos;t quite figure it out .
a big problem with understanding one of those perspectives : when we first approached one of the big u.k. charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff , what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal .
tom treasure , professor of cardiothoracic surgery : incredible guy .
it &apos;s lighter than an ipad , it &apos;s a bit cheaper .
yeah .
and technology has even changed our relationship to god .
you don &apos;t want to be the ham in the middle .
and what can a cartoonist do ?
and then in kenya , what we did was addressing the issue of ethnicity , which is a poison in a lot of places in africa .
so , i want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood .
and i really do think we have to start thinking about what &apos;s a good planet and what isn &apos;t .
and very soon after , the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been since complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record .
this evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the permian , 250 million years ago , a comet hit us .
you can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front .
you only have to go to the black sea and a few other places -- some lakes -- and get down , and you &apos;ll find that the water itself turns purple .
all right , what &apos;s the consequence ? the oceans probably turn purple .
&quot; i believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s . &quot;
how many of you have exceeded it ? yeah , i &apos;ve certainly exceeded it .
heparin -- a blood thinner , a pharmaceutical product -- starts out in artisanal workshops like this in china , because the active ingredient comes from pigs &apos; intestines .
now , that &apos;s not a new story .
we don &apos;t have a system to ensure that human rights , basic dignity , are ensured .
everybody else at the table said , &quot; folks , that doesn &apos;t cut it .
it &apos;s crazy .
just look at pandemics -- swine flu , bird flu , h1n1 .
it starts with just giving people back their dignity .
or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place , to see if you can change him . &quot;
thank you .
i felt that my two secret loves , poetry and theatre , had come together , had a baby , a baby i needed to get to know .
it &apos;s about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience you &apos;ve collected up to now to help you dive into the things you don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t have anything interesting to say . &quot;
and that is an amazing realization to have , especially when you &apos;re 14 .
the long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder .
and you , you get to share mine .
in the face of poor political judgment or political inaction , it becomes a kind of intervention , assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior .
a destroyed tank belonging to somoza &apos;s national guard was left as a monument in a park in managua , and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child .
farmers were driven off their land , and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen .
the imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home .
these heroin addicts in detox in pakistan reminded me of figures in a play by beckett : isolated , waiting in the dark , but drawn to the light .
a few minutes later when i looked again and saw the second tower burning , i knew we were at war .
good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results .
the ballot boxes go to counting places .
and because it &apos;s encrypted , it can be submitted , stored and counted centrally and displayed on a website for anyone to see , including you .
my talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman .
that &apos;s where we find islamic majority .
and when we enter into this century , you &apos;ll find more than half of mankind down here .
and many think that these countries are stagnant , but they are not .
i couldn &apos;t agree more . science couldn &apos;t agree more .
and then it &apos;s my box .
i &apos;m the luckiest guy in the world .
and that prediction came true , and this little girl is rahima banu , and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world .
and by day 13 , the lesions are scabbing , his eyelids are swollen , but you know this child has no other secondary infection .
and in the process , i learned something very important .
but we need to have early detection , early response .
if it happens , how bad do you think it will be ?
and i think we owe a great debt of gratitude to gphin and to ron st. john , who i hope is in the audience some place -- over there -- who &apos;s the founder of gphin .
and we &apos;ll grow it as a moral force in the world , finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them , and sending our response to them . so that next year , instead of us meeting here , lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world , we will have pulled together , used the unique skills and the magic of this community , and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics , other catastrophes , and change the world beginning right now .
well , they &apos;re only crawling in seven languages .
and if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050 , that &apos;s the century when we build all the world &apos;s cities , the century that we &apos;re in the middle of right now .
so let &apos;s make beautiful , functional , affordable , sustainable products .
it &apos;s a brilliant textile in use .
but then it comes to your operations .
i think we &apos;d all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable .
on having really good sustainability strategies , there are companies like nike , patagonia , timberland , marks &amp; amp ; spencer .
take a breath right now of this clear air in this room .
that was adolf hitler &apos;s first title for &quot; mein kampf &quot; -- &quot; my struggle &quot; -- the book that launched the nazi party .
and we used these questions : share some of your life experiences with me .
it &apos;s two people , two warriors , dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other .
i invite you into three recent stories of mine , which are about this way of looking , if you will , which i believe exemplify the tenets of what i like to call compassion in storytelling .
this image , to me , is almost like from a shakespearean play , with a man , surrounded by various influences , desperate to hold on to something true within himself , in a context of great suffering that he has created himself .
in 2007 and 2009 i did stories on the delhi fire service , the dfs , which , during the summer , is probably the world &apos;s most active fire department .
and i &apos;ve had very serious doubt about its efficacy , and my own faith in humanity .
god damn it .
this is -- this is intense material , i should warn you .
and there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurgents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
and what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the u.s. military , and he says , &quot; you know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
we have to try better . let &apos;s show them another example .
yeah . have you had information from inside bp ?
but the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
i mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world -- within the e.u. , between china and the united states .
when i assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements , i can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form .
you place it in a music hall , it all of a sudden becomes a musical score .
and i was wondering why nobody knew more about this dangerous grilled chicken , which doesn &apos;t seem very harmful .
now i &apos;m not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that &apos;s not marinated , you &apos;re definitely going to catch cancer and die .
in fact , one in 70 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer .
that &apos;s why being the grand prize winner of the google global science fair -- cute picture , right -- it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor .
and i have a volunteer subject in the audience today , julie .
because what i feel , is a lot of us think that the environment is at a macro level , that we can &apos;t do anything to change our air quality or to change the climate or anything .
&quot; no , no , no ! it should be the incredibles . &quot;
i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s amazing , because i don &apos;t feel disabled . &quot;
then another character was a half-woman , half-cheetah -- a little homage to my life as an athlete .
and what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting-edge technology -- robotics , bionics -- with the age-old poetry , we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity .
but i think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
i was representing the shanghai expo .
and because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern oem manufacturing compound in china : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .
they have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
people are thinking about the following questions : are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher gdp ?
there is nothing to eat up here , but the conditions were ideal for hibernation .
see what you think .
some of the world &apos;s astronomers have telescopes nearby .
culture where creativity was consumed but the consumer is not a creator .
but most important was that bmi took public domain works and made arrangements of them , which they gave away for free to their subscribers . so that in 1940 , when ascap threatened to double their rates , the majority of broadcasters switched to bmi .
you &apos;re every step i make ...
instead , what we &apos;ve seen is something much worse than a revolt .
it is technology that has made them different , and as we see what this technology can do , we need to recognize you can &apos;t kill the instinct the technology produces . we can only criminalize it .
it &apos;s the single greatest mapping project we &apos;ve ever been on .
and the amoeba dubia doesn &apos;t look like much , except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters , which is what makes you you , as far as gene code inside each of your cells , and this little amoeba which , you know , sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions , turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside .
i mean , george bush -- he &apos;s going to be gone , alright ? life isn &apos;t .
that means each of you will contain on a cd your entire gene code .
but because each of your cells contains your entire gene code , each cell can be reprogrammed , if we don &apos;t stop stem cell research and if we don &apos;t stop genomic research , to express different body functions .
because in all leukemia , that set of genes over there over-expresses .
that is the genomically literate world . and that is a problem .
just smart people moving bits . different rules .
and the really interesting thing is , you and your kids are empowered to build great empires , and you don &apos;t need a lot to do it .
jakob trollback : a new kind of music video
sometimes we &apos;re willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity , maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret , secret .
but in another study , it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other .
koko was taught to communicate via sign language .
and these allegations are false .
we think warmth and smiles convey honesty , sincerity .
now that smile is known in the trade as &quot; duping delight . &quot;
we know , for example , we know liars will shift their blink rate , point their feet towards an exit .
here you &apos;re going to see no false emotion , just the authentic expression of a mother &apos;s agony .
pamela meyer : how to spot a liar
and talking about war , my girlfriend has this great t-shirt that says , &quot; bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity . &quot;
basically , it ends up as &quot; god is on a bicycle with his angels . &quot;
they wished they &apos;d not packed rice .
a lot of us are very privileged .
in that moment , fraser says , &quot; i am lost already , but not you ... not you . &quot;
and so they said , &quot; tell me about africa , professor abani . &quot;
i have to drive trouble in the hills .
and after i left mattel , i started all these hamburger makers , and then got the license to make the maker .
this is a clay maker .
and a guy named stan reznikov did this as a pilot .
this is my wife , christi , and abby , and melissa , and my 17-year-old now , emily , who was just a pack of trouble .
and originally , furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom .
at that time , beanie babies was a big hit , and we thought , we &apos;ll do a bunch of different ones .
and the cams i got cut at hewlett packard .
and we &apos;re going to try to really pull this off , intentfully try to make something that seems like it &apos;s alive .
and there &apos;s kind of the first exploded view , or see-through view .
so this one , this one &apos;s actually asleep , and -- hang on .
we did include some things that are hopefully useful .
but i am surprised by one thing that they do have : coca-cola .
it &apos;s a lot like other consumer companies .
i think a great example of this is ethiopia &apos;s new health extension program .
but they localize it .
people reuse it for a slab for their home .
and polio , i think , is one of the most powerful examples .
now one of the challenges in polio , still , is marketing , but it might not be what you think .
very unlikely , joe would jump on a pristine coral reef , a virgin coral reef with lots of coral , sharks , crocodiles , manatees , groupers , turtles , etc .
but then , if we shift the dial 200 , 500 years back , then we get to the places where the corals are absolutely healthy and gorgeous , forming spectacular structures , and where the predators are the most conspicuous thing , where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive .
in christmas , where the food web is really trimmed down , where the large animals are gone , the corals have not recovered .
so let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do .
we have this principal that we don &apos;t touch ; that produces returns , social , economic and ecological .
the estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
it &apos;s the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits .
es : at least in the seas .
well , enric , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . thank you .
here &apos;s a jelly .
and here he is , flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up .
and eventually , we can come up with something like this .
a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here .
bl : one of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites , it &apos;s rather difficult to collect these animals .
the vents are emitting a black body radiation -- an ir signature -- and so they &apos;re able to find these vents at considerable distances .
here &apos;s a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm , waiting for that worm to stick his head out .
so , what we &apos;ve got to learn now is to find out where this planet &apos;s going at all these different scales and work with it .
so first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
and if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that -- which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
and that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , i teach kids -- because of my inexperience -- i teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?
and the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; good morning america &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
the finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there &apos;s a very high suicide rate , but by golly , they are qualified .
and luckily , he met this guy , who is rodrigo baggio , the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in brazil .
or you could go to places like this .
many of them don &apos;t have electricity at home .
in the schools and communities that taio works in , the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question .
and he was finally brought back into school , not by the offer of gcses , but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter , a practical making skill .
yet , everyone knows what is a chinese restaurant .
and all around the world now you see more and more schools reinventing themselves .
it will bring skills and learning and reading .
i remember that scene like it was yesterday ; i was 16 , i was in tears , i was in the closet , and i &apos;m looking at these two people , ferris bueller and some guy i &apos;d never seen before , fighting for love .
this is the super duper evil gay lifestyle .
i &apos;ve paid my dues on time , i &apos;ve marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine , and i &apos;ve yet to see a copy of the gay agenda .
not based upon the quality of your work , how long you &apos;ve been there , if you stink , just if you &apos;re gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered .
i would like to think that he &apos;s a good boy , a respectful young man . i would like to think that i &apos;ve proven to be a capable father .
that &apos;s the metaphor , the old metaphor .
i have such a powerful feeling of well-being .
in this article , mr. selinger wrote the following to describe what was happening to him .
and they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning to a person &apos;s life .
we have agency .
as i say , every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these .
now this is a plant .
they &apos;re sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that &apos;ll have it .
&quot; now why does it do this , &quot; i hear you ask .
so maybe the chemical in that would be useful .
i mean , people cried . i &apos;ve never seen my mother cry like that at the end of monopoly .
so , &quot; honey , come here , let &apos;s get your picture with the black guy . &quot;
and so the basic gist of it is , i grabbed a bunch of families , and she &apos;s like , &quot; mommy , but you forgot the pink baby and you forgot the blue daddy and you forgot all these other things . &quot;
i was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics , and if you &apos;re going to cover a difficult topic , this is one you need to cover , and i &apos;ll let you figure out what that &apos;s about on your own .
this is a project called flight patterns .
and you can see , over time , the ways the airports change .
so they made this web service and said , &quot; any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people . &quot;
that gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication .
we asked people to draw what it was that they saw .
after previewing it and confirming it &apos;s what you submitted , you could submit it into the mechanical turk with no other context .
and he ended up talking to rick rubin , who was finishing up johnny cash &apos;s final album called &quot; ain &apos;t no grave . &quot;
and below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project .
and as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data , we have an opportunity , and maybe even an obligation , to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories as we explore and collaborate together .
and he slashed so many budgets that people said they couldn &apos;t afford paintings anymore , and they needed to have their portrait &quot; a la silhouette . &quot;
so scrolls are very convenient , because you can create a large image on a very small table .
people tell me their lives , their memories , their aspirations , and i create a mindscape .
and running gives me a lot of energy .
it &apos;s called &quot; fashion statement , &quot; and there are quotes about fashion , so you can read it , and also , because the definition of artist book is very generous .
and then the fruit of the world for silicon valley today .
so i brought back the rabbit , the dragonfly , to stay in that street .
one of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs .
and that &apos;s a new way of looking at luxury goods .
the closer two people are , in age , in background , in the process of identification , the more there is a danger of envy -- which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion -- because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with .
there is a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser , and that shows 400 years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives .
but something very valuable in that idea , nevertheless .
and then my favorite .
you can &apos;t be successful at everything .
alain de botton : yes . i think it &apos;s merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that i wanted to stress .
just why , why didn &apos;t i do it better ? why ? why ? why ?
i say , &quot; no , it &apos;s got to be 15 hours , &quot; and i swim another minute out and another minute back to make the 15 hours .
about the 50th hour , i was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe .
help me ! somebody help me ! &quot;
and how odd is this intelligent person who put this together and got all these world experts together .
so now what do i do ?
and by the way , a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on wikipedia and he said he saw my birthday was august 22nd 1949 , and for some odd reason in wikipedia , they had my death date too .
it &apos;s now wired -- or i should say , wireless -- by taking the aggregate of these signals in the hospital , in the intensive care unit , and putting it on a smartphone for physicians .
gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway , as today many of these things are dedicated gateways , because they are not so well integrated .
and this one , which is really telling , this was from july , this cover article : &quot; the personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise . it &apos;s about tracking every facet of life , from sleep to mood to pain , 24 / 7 / 365 . &quot;
it monitors your brainwaves continuously , when you &apos;re sleeping .
look at this thing and say , &quot; well , i didn &apos;t think i was a very good sleeper , but actually i did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds . &quot; ok ?
aging : the problem is enormous , 300,000 broken hips per year ; but the solutions are extraordinary , and they include so many different things .
we can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it .
and i think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease , and then you don &apos;t have to explain .
and arthur was looking at this old book , and he said , &quot; well , that was wrong .
the stuff has a very short half-life , same with brain science .
so you see , it &apos;s almost like a pavlovian -- we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories , where you say , how do people learn how to react to a situation ? what i &apos;m saying is , after we go through a lot of levels , including designing a huge , messy system with thousands of ports , we &apos;ll end up again with the central problem of psychology .
in order to learn them , you have to go work in those restaurants .
in this case , boiling water canning is for canning things that are already pretty acidic .
and so it showed up , we used it a little while , we cut it in half .
but now you will ; we put a biography of james watt in .
the key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of 1,600 .
five to 10 thousand years ! now imagine this .
one of the most famous of these guys , frere jacques , shown here doing a lithotomy -- which is the removal of the bladder stone , one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time -- had to take less than two minutes .
you could now start doing surgery everywhere , on the gut , on the liver , on the heart , on the brain .
you &apos;ve got these long instruments , and you &apos;re working off your centerline .
but there are other barriers .
but it &apos;s worth it for the freedom that this gives us as we &apos;re going around .
because they let you keep continence , bladder control , and sexual function after surgery , all of which is generally fairly important to the patient .
without biologist alexander fleming &apos;s moldy accident , caused by a neglected workstation , we wouldn &apos;t be able to fight off so many bacterial infections .
phthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexibility , durability and transparency .
jy : now that we grew the bacteria , we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates , because we thought that would be less accident-prone , but we were wrong again .
and perhaps one day we &apos;ll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste .
it is rough and it is flat .
design is the same way . design has to become that same way .
so i &apos;ve always liked this prototype picture .
it &apos;s kind of a brutal quote .
and here is some family pictures .
ed : okay , good .
and we could have been born 100,000 years ago .
and i think that all of us in this room , as you move design forward , it &apos;s not about just doing one thing .
and part of why this stuff is important and all the things that we do are important , is that these are the ideas we need .
they do it to make a profit .
but if corruption creeps in and people don &apos;t have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law , then if you can use violence , if you can use violence with impunity , you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery .
if you look at a long-term chart , prices are at historical lows and yet global demand for forced labor is still real strong .
you buy them cheaply , you use them , you crumple them up , and then when you &apos;re done with them you just throw them away .
liberation , and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation .
children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in ghana , reunited with their parents , and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well-being so that they become slave-proof -- absolutely unenslaveable .
so we have to appeal to them , the legislators in the state government , and turn to something they understand , that they have to promote the economic development of their state economy .
i don &apos;t know if you ever tried to buy a house in silicon valley .
and maybe michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in ann arbor , michigan , and be worried these little wolverines will end up moving to ohio and becoming buckeyes .
i actually think the more profound barrier is the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs .
the first is zero electrical resistance , and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor .
why ? because any movement of the superconductor will change their place , will change their configuration .
i can take this disk and put it here , and while it stays here -- don &apos;t move -- i will try to rotate the track , and hopefully , if i did it correctly , it stays suspended .
i had maybe nine months .
but instead of a bellows , i had a leaf blower .
and for a while that was looking really good .
and for about five seconds , the toaster toasted , but then , unfortunately , the element kind of melted itself .
it &apos;s really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties .
and the cost of a transistor cycle , which is a measure of the price performance of electronics , comes down about every year .
the amount of data we &apos;re getting about the brain is doubling every year .
like for example , applying the internet , which is now ubiquitous , in the rural areas of china or in africa , to bringing health information to developing areas of the world .
i turned around to check on my friend &apos;s house .
at the phi phi hill resort , i was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television , but i strained to listen for information .
and i want to ask three questions in this talk , in the 10 minutes that remain , about the blogosphere .
it would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of beans in the jar , and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you .
it is , as steven johnson has talked about , an emergent phenomenon .
so , that &apos;s the upside . the circular mill is the downside .
i went down to washington . i saw these guys , and said , &quot; i did what you asked me . i looked at what &apos;s out there .
now he &apos;s going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger .
they , in fact , are an endangered species themselves .
but for the most part , we &apos;ve gone from salting to exhausting .
and so for animals that come to the surface to breathe , such as this elephant seal , it &apos;s an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean .
that &apos;s the warm colors which show a well-sampled region .
this particular shrimp , we &apos;ve dubbed it the jurassic shrimp , it &apos;s thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago -- at least it was , until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of australia .
and from that , we actually calculate that we know about 16,500 marine species and there are probably another 1,000 to 4,000 left to go .
for example , these tuna that were once so abundant in the north sea are now effectively gone .
nellie mckay : &quot; mother of pearl , &quot; &quot; if i had you &quot;
it &apos;s victimless . it &apos;s meat from a test tube .
so , sarah and i -- my wife -- walked over to the public library , which is four blocks away , on pacific street , and we got the oed , and we looked in there , and there are 14 definitions of hope , none of which really hits you between the eyes as being the appropriate one .
&quot; the world will not be saved by the internet . &quot;
there has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days .
not all species on our planet have brains , so if we want to know what the brain is for , let &apos;s think about why we evolved one .
that problem is solved .
and she &apos;s pretty happy .
and it &apos;s more recently a unifying way to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty .
that information is available in the current shot , but there &apos;s another source of information not available on the current shot , but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis , and that &apos;s that the ball doesn &apos;t bounce with equal probability over the court during the match .
well there &apos;s good reasons .
either no time delay , in which case light would just tickle your palm , or with a time delay of two-tenths of three-tenths of a second .
so we decided to test this in the lab .
i could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths .
so what i actually get , based on this lovely , smooth , desired force , is a very noisy version .
you only need to store things which are really going to effect movement .
we had four spacecraft , two around mars , two on the surface -- an amazing accomplishment .
but there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water .
sixteen percent , by weight , of the interior contains frozen water , or ice .
and that &apos;s because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites .
this is what ares looks like as it flies over mars .
the airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time .
it &apos;s a large effort . it &apos;s all at nasa langley research center .
and we put down those little floor tiles , and then i went onto ebay and bought 150 pounds of lego -- which is insane .
and then whatever you design virtually , you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later .
because there aren &apos;t enough ted logos around here .
and so , i want to tell you about what we &apos;ve learned in doing that and four lessons i &apos;ve learned in the last year .
that &apos;s a third of the u.s. population .
it &apos;s necessary and , just as important , it &apos;s good for the california economy .
it &apos;s created a million jobs inside that country , and it &apos;s saved 32 million tons of co2 . it &apos;s really substantial .
and , of course , at kleiner we , kind of , apologize and say the second best way is to finance it .
that &apos;s about as much co2 as there is in the whole world .
because if we do , i can look forward to the conversation i &apos;m going to have with my daughter in 20 years .
and at the very beginning , not too many people are affected , and you get this classic sigmoidal , or s-shaped , curve .
so , let me ask you this -- i can cultivate this intuition by asking a question -- who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network , a or b ?
and if they nominate the party host as their friend , that party host has a hundred friends , therefore , has more friends than they do .
so this would be a technique whereby we could get more than a month-and-a-half warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population .
so , for example , most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity .
and all this administrative data can be pulled together and processed to understand human behavior in a way we never could before .
throughout my career , i &apos;ve been fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects , documenting their work and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they sit .
a walk through the tower reveals how residents have figured out how to create walls , how to make an air flow , how to create transparency , circulation throughout the tower , essentially creating a home that &apos;s completely adapted to the conditions of the site .
they were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator for all of the community to enjoy .
but despite this elaborate decor , sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways , like this home which caught my attention while all the mud and the grass was literally seeping out under the front door .
in the center of caracas , venezuela , stands the 45-story &quot; tower of david , &quot; an unfinished , abandoned skyscraper . but about eight years ago , people started moving in . photographer iwan baan shows how people build homes in unlikely places , touring us through the family apartments of torre david , a city on the water in nigeria , and an underground village in china . glorious images celebrate humanity &apos;s ability to survive and make a home -- anywhere .
spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper , and they calculated by hand .
so baxter is up here .
that puts the green icon there .
demographics is really going to change our world .
it &apos;s about a little boy whose father was a history buff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis on the outskirts of their camp .
the results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers .
and we created a project we call the cyark 500 challenge -- and that is to digitally preserve 500 world heritage sites in five years .
so you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes .
and the journalist said , why is there so little response out of washington ?
it &apos;s got all the ups and the downs of movements .
why is what has been achieved , or what the movement has done , been necessary but not sufficient to the crime ?
now , who was sergio ? sergio vieira de mello was his name .
talk about evil prevailing . i mean , here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in cambodia .
so sergio -- this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness , lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue .
but he lunged in the opposite direction .
let &apos;s focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats , but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic , of a fear .
first , i &apos;ll ask you : why should you care ?
we know how to fix hunger .
because actually we know how to fix it very simply .
it doesn &apos;t need to be refrigerated , it doesn &apos;t need water , which is often lacking .
cameroon , northern cameroon , boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades .
they have to be nutritious , and they have to be locally produced .
the fact is studies show that the cost of malnutrition and hunger -- the cost to society , the burden it has to bear -- is on average six percent , and in some countries up to 11 percent , of gdp a year .
but when you start to read the article by cliff , who himself is a cancer survivor , who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from new york city to upstate new york to get an experimental therapy for -- at the time -- hodgkin &apos;s disease , which saved his life , he makes remarkable points here .
because the problem is , when you have advanced cancer , we can &apos;t do that much today about it , as the statistics allude to .
it makes no sense , if you think about it .
this isn &apos;t a genetic disease .
but if during one of those days your temperature spiked to 102 for six hours , and you took tylenol and got better , etc . , i would totally miss it .
it &apos;s used to treat osteoporosis , and they got that twice a year .
look a decade ago , look two decades ago : markedly different .
ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here , and the drug went to the fda , and the fda said , &quot; without a placebo , how do i know patients actually benefited from the drug ? &quot;
and so , a lot of what has been done with people like danny hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles , try to bring the software .
too often , says david agus cancer treatments have a short-sighted focus on individual cells . he suggests a new , cross-disciplinary approach , using atypical drugs , computer modeling and protein analysis to diagnose and treat the whole body .
you can &apos;t understand two people talking at once or in this case one person talking twice .
just a word on music . music is the most powerful sound there is , often inappropriately deployed .
thirdly , make it valuable . give people something with the sound .
you &apos;ll be in a massive headwind .
i &apos;m not going to answer that . but i will answer some of the more popular questions .
ray zahab : my trek to the south pole
and i &apos;m living proof .
and fortunately , in our time , we &apos;ve learned more about the problems than in all preceding history .
that &apos;s bad news for the polar bears .
there are a few oysters in chesapeake bay .
97 percent of the land in the galapagos islands is protected , but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing .
thank you .
and we tackle this problem by building giant , dynamically scaled model robot insects that would flap in giant pools of mineral oil where we could study the aerodynamic forces .
now several people at this conference have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience because they &apos;re a simple model of brain function .
and i think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice , it &apos;s really comparable . they have to forage for food .
and i think , from an engineering perspective , you think of multiplexing .
so let me show you a little tiny sequence of this .
so these basic concepts of multitasking in time and multitasking in space , i think these are things that are true in our brains as well , but i think the insects are the true masters of this .
without decisions you cannot see , you cannot think , you cannot feel .
so , you can think of the neocortex actually as the ultimate solution today , of the universe as we know it .
the perception , the symphony that you create is going to be corrupted , and you will have symptoms of disease .
so there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another , and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours .
so we can describe the communication between the neurons .
so the next step is just to take these brain coordinates and to project them into perceptual space .
ted taylor , who led the project , was going to take his children .
and that &apos;s why when you get something declassified , that &apos;s what it looks like .
and pulse system yield : we &apos;re looking at 20-kiloton yield for an effect for us of 10 million newtons .
so i &apos;m going to tell you the good news and the bad news .
something a bit more free , less constrained . &quot;
you can &apos;t look at this and say , &quot; okay now i see reality as it is . &quot;
so i want to show you some cognitive illusions , or decision-making illusions , in the same way .
turns out the secret has to do with a form at the dmv .
how could we care about something less than something that happens after we die ?
well the good news is that most physicians in this case decided to pull the patient and try the ibuprofen .
it &apos;s a funny idea , because why would having your car stolen , in this set , influence anything ?
so i printed another version of this , where i eliminated the middle option .
when ugly tom was around , tom was popular .
behavioral economist dan ariely , the author of predictably irrational , uses classic visual illusions and his own counterintuitive research findings to show how we &apos;re not as rational as we think when we make decisions .
you have to switch off your mobile phone during flights .
so not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum , let &apos;s compare that with a number i &apos;ve just mentioned .
you will say , &quot; okay , this is nice -- a slide created in 10 minutes . &quot;
it is this light that transmits this high-definition video in a split stream .
look around . everywhere . look at your smart phone .
and every street lamp could be a free access point .
how &apos;s your genome today ? have you thought about it lately ?
look at this screen here and , you know , you see pictures and you see words , but really all there are are ones and zeros .
we actually have about 24,000 genes that do things .
it &apos;s all hidden in this code , and it &apos;s starting to be understood at breakneck pace .
so , you know , by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism , the software , if you will , changes the hardware .
our ocean &apos;s teaming with microbes ; in fact , when craig venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean , in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water .
i don &apos;t believe that chemicals are unnatural .
thank you .
his one mistake is he &apos;s a tibetan mastiff , and a few months later , he weighs , you know , 80 pounds .
why aren &apos;t you responding ? oh , you don &apos;t speak swahili .
so the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do , and this is very easy .
and so we have to enforce , but without force .
&quot; bad bear , bad bear ! &quot; voom !
and i went , &quot; oh my god , do i do something ? &quot;
we take the good for granted , and we moan and groan at the bad .
i &apos;m going to present three projects in rapid fire .
this is the first one , and this is showing , over the last 900 years , the evolution of the book and other technologies .
what you &apos;re seeing on the right is the design of the library , specifically in terms of square footage .
so , now i &apos;m going to take you on a tour of the building .
it allows you to , on one city block , go up one full floor , so that it &apos;s on a continuum .
the balconies all move to go between those configurations , but they also disappear .
so these -- we &apos;re starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub .
the moment the cores get to mid level , we finish the art museum ; we put all the mechanical equipment in it ; and then we jack it up into the air .
so you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book .
wk : this is my parents , holding the radio .
and there &apos;s few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience , especially when it &apos;s half-finished .
or ears being able to hear themselves -- it &apos;s just impossible .
i want to talk to you briefly about perception .
well you can &apos;t get much bigger than pi , the mathematical constant .
that &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , i &apos;m sure .
because think of the picture -- not the word , the picture .
i think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
they &apos;ve come together .
well , the answer came from david ricardo in 1817 .
in other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
ants are a classic example ; workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
they were a highly cooperative species .
well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called mount isa , which was a quarry owned by the kalkadoon tribe .
i am of course quoting from a famous essay by leonard read , the economist in the 1950s , called &quot; i , pencil &quot; in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it don &apos;t know how to mine graphite , and they don &apos;t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
and what i mean by that , it &apos;s the behaviors that we &apos;re in denial about , and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness .
and that &apos;s gone up since then , but we don &apos;t have the numbers yet .
this is just lots and lots of cigarettes : 65,000 cigarettes , which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month , and every month in the u.s .
bush &apos;s new budget is in the trillions , and these are numbers that our brain just doesn &apos;t have the ability to comprehend .
you &apos;re looking at the outside shell of the virus , and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very , very fast , and the blue parts are not evolving very fast .
but really , it &apos;s pretty robust .
how do i know which rhinovirus i have ?
they &apos;re healthy ; they &apos;re clean -- it &apos;s amazing .
everything that we could get out of genbank -- that is , the national repository of sequences .
what to do next ? don &apos;t know .
clearly , we have a case of a healthy person that &apos;s going down .
is it really in the tissue ? and i &apos;ll end up with this : yes .
you see , the battery is the key enabling device here .
we need to think about the problem differently .
it is this that caught and held my attention to the point that i became obsessed with inventing a battery that could capture this gigantic economy of scale .
so what to do next ?
so today at lmbc , we &apos;re building cells 16 inches in diameter with a capacity of one kilowatt-hour -- 1,000 times the capacity of that initial shotglass cell .
donald sadoway : the missing link to renewable energy
and so , the games that i do , i think of really more as modern montessori toys .
when they were able to make stuff in the game they had a tremendous amount of empathy in connection to it . even if it wasn &apos;t as pretty as what other people would make it -- as a professional artist would make for games -- it really stuck with them and they really cared about what would happen to it .
and i can see how it might dance .
and most games kind of put the player in the role of luke skywalker , this protagonist playing through this story .
it &apos;s almost in the same way that a telescope or microscope recalibrates your eyesight ; i think computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct across vast scales of both space and time .
and so you &apos;d have this wonderful sparkling thing , with the disk slowly rotating , and this is roughly what it would look like . and so really , part of this is about bringing the beauty of this , of the natural world , to somebody in a very imaginative way , so that they can start calibrating their instinct across these vast scales of space and time .
here they are arriving at number 10 , and look at this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states . oh , and here comes the prime minister of the — ? no .
it &apos;s about opening up . and this is true across the animal kingdom . it &apos;s not just limited to primates .
and this is really important in the mba classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
probably not , right ? you want the person who &apos;s powerful and assertive and dominant , but not very stress reactive , the person who &apos;s laid back .
so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive , confident and comfortable , or really stress-reactive , and , you know , feeling sort of shut down . and we &apos;ve all had the feeling , right ?
they &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . they &apos;re blind to the conditions .
so i felt entirely powerless . i worked and worked and worked , and i got lucky , and worked , and got lucky , and worked .
the last thing i &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
and yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking .
many people have laid down their lives for communism , and many have laid down their lives for capitalism .
the idea of replicating ideas ; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain .
what &apos;s a word made of ?
it &apos;s part of their plan .
but we should recognize that for many people in the world , they are a big deal .
but i &apos;m happy to say now that the world has moved on , music has moved on with it .
i heard about 2,000 singers and pulled together a company of 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers , the majority of whom were black , but there were a handful of white performers .
therefore it &apos;s the exclusive preserve of an elite , talented body .
we &apos;re going to sing those three wonderful notes : t , e , d .
so i decided to create a platform for that potential .
now one day in 1772 , the prince decreed that the musicians &apos; families , the orchestral musicians &apos; families , were no longer welcome in the castle .
but so , curious , i run up to the child -- of course scaring the living bejesus out of him -- grab him by the collar , turn it over , and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater .
and at the same time , what keeps me up at night is a fear that we &apos;ll look at the victories of the g8 -- 50 billion dollars in increased aid to africa , 40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory , as more than chapter one , as our moral absolution .
what he did was see what was happening in israel , larger approaches , and figure out how to do a drip irrigation , which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock .
today , three years later , the company has employed another thousand women .
i want to end just by saying that there &apos;s enormous opportunity to make poverty history .
they gave it back to the wise old woman .
because , after all , within living memory , they were hunters and gatherers , living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 percent of the human story .
and the talks got off to a rather rocky start when the vice president of chechnya began by pointing at the russians and said , &quot; you should stay right here in your seats , because you &apos;re going to be on trial for war crimes . &quot;
whether we &apos;re christians , muslims or jews , religious or non-religious , we feel we have a personal stake in it .
terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear .
you &apos;ve got to cross all these borders .
in cincinnati , for instance , that organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an abrahamic meal together .
the potential is basically to change the game .
that &apos;s walking abraham &apos;s path .
the hate mail i get is unbelievable .
sean hannity is one of the sweetest guys i &apos;ve ever met .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m a parent , i &apos;m a resident and i &apos;m a teacher .
so i wanted to figure out how i could get this kind of success into something small , like this , and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it , kids who didn &apos;t want to be outside could do it , and everyone could have access .
and this is where it becomes true triple bottom line .
produce pete can &apos;t believe what we grow .
and what does it really do ?
nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other .
amazed people . the glory and bounty that is bronx county .
it &apos;s not . i come from a place where kids can buy 35 flavors of blunt wrap at any day of the moment , where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor .
about half of them , 600,000 , have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on .
we see that the signal that &apos;s actually in the heart , we can use it to tell people that they &apos;re having a heart attack even before they have symptoms so we can save their life .
so there it was , thursday morning we stopped the pig &apos;s medication and there is his electrogram , the signal from inside the pig &apos;s heart coming out by radio telemetry .
and when you have a blockage , the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device , which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago and the one that caused the alarm , so you can take it to the emergency room and show them , and say , take care of me right away .
and that &apos;s a fully developed visual aura , as we see on top .
the most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times , and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches , not only those with aura , get treated and get diminished .
then we stimulated , and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal , which means they did not get the epileptic seizure .
i think she said it looks like a gun . a lot of people don &apos;t like guns .
and that is one of the ideas .
there is even some from the u.s .
so you &apos;ve got a lot of information . that &apos;s great .
and my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook .
thank you .
and so what i want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas that we &apos;ve seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books , using them and teaching from them .
what about copying , reusing , right ?
how much would it cost in a bookstore ?
it gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student , so that every student can have a book or a course that &apos;s customized to their learning style , their context , their language and the things that excite them .
so , what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning and what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework that makes sharing safe , and makes it easily understandable , and the inspiration here is taken from open-source software , things like linux and the gpl .
ok , you come to ted . why do you come to ted ?
so that &apos;s certainly part of it .
the days of pilot projects are over , when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works . &quot;
and the fun part -- and i &apos;m quite focused on it -- i tell people i used to be a light bulb , but now i &apos;m a laser -- i &apos;m just going to get that thing built , and it turns out it &apos;s not so hard .
that &apos;s why a lot of our people are more or less living in taiwan right now .
have they all agreed ? no , not completely ; probably thailand , brazil and nigeria are the three that are the most active , and most agreed .
the only criticism , and people really don &apos;t want to criticize this , because it is a humanitarian effort ; it is a nonprofit effort ; and to criticize it is a little bit stupid , actually .
and the reason is that tool use , in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years , everything has been a physical modification of self .
he took a piece of paper , drew a and b on one side and the other and folded them together so where a and b touched .
we &apos;re all &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a great assembly line of information , and we can &apos;t keep up .
we &apos;re just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other , regardless of geography .
and then you go to baragwanath hospital , outside of johannesburg in south africa , and 8,000 hiv-positive pregnant women giving birth -- a hospital the same as a country .
and it &apos;s the same with nurses .
and then you &apos;re out on the street , and you don &apos;t know where to go .
patients are experts on their own experience , and they can share that experience with others .
disclosure is so central to prevention .
i thought you were going to throw me out of the family . &quot;
our organization works on three levels .
those who are hiv-negative must know how to stay negative .
you can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush .
we tell them , okay , we &apos;re going to do exactly the same thing but this time there &apos;s no director . instead you &apos;ve got to ignore objects with the dark gray background .
and this region , the regions within the limbic system , have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults , and at the very same time , the prefrontal cortex , which you can see in blue in the slide here , which stops us taking excessive risks , is still very much in development in adolescents .
so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand , and a few years later , he was diagnosed with cancer .
this was right about the time that i was offered a position here at berkeley , and when i got here , i looked up hubert dreyfus , who &apos;s a world-renowned professor of philosophy , and i talked with him about this , and he said , &quot; this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy . it goes back to the skeptics , and up through descartes .
she knew when to trust her instincts , and so that project taught me another lesson about life , which is that , when in doubt , improvise .
we observe the results , adjust the controls again , and observe what happens .
now i eat whenever i &apos;m hungry , and i &apos;ve lost 10 pounds .
dr. rudy leibel of columbia university has found that people who have lost 10 percent of their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their metabolism is suppressed .
i left almost all my graphs at home , but i couldn &apos;t resist throwing in just this one , because i &apos;m a geek , and that &apos;s how i roll .
think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop , and let your hunger decide when you should be done .
i &apos;m a man who &apos;s trying to live from his heart , and so just before i get going , i wanted to tell you as a south african that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago .
you are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who i am .
it was a hot day , and we found ourselves down by the river .
i make an instant decision that i &apos;ll never look at that again .
in fact , solly gave her the name elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the elvis the pelvis dance .
and it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet .
about 75 years ago , my grandfather , a young man , walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that , and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen : none other than mae west , the heartthrob of the &apos; 30s , and he could never forget her .
it caused so much trouble for me .
and i &apos;ve been very supportive until this picture shows up on my facebook page .
i keep saying , &quot; nets , you live in the past while i &apos;ll create the future , and when i &apos;m done , you can study about it . &quot;
raghava kk : what &apos;s your 200-year plan ?
conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow .
i want you to know that me , my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips .
mentions of polar bears drowning : four percent .
you know , it basically uses as its central premise greek mythology .
they did some research ; we came back ; and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually asking for .
so i want to show you some prototypes .
so , we &apos;ve talked a lot about global warming , but , you know , as jill said , it sounds kind of nice -- good weather in the wintertime , and new york city .
so we &apos;re going to build this new building on stilts .
a few years later , there &apos;s no snow left at all .
and that same year , 10 years ago , i headed north to the phoenix islands .
it &apos;s a very deep-water part of our planet .
and that &apos;s the area again .
and these nations are faced with a real problem .
and the deal that they strike is the extracting country gives kiribati five percent of the landed value .
then in 2002 , when this was all going full-swing , a coral-bleaching event happened in the phoenix islands .
you can read them yourselves .
when you graph the number of potential employees versus the number of jobs in the country , you see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time , and then , during the great recession , it opened up in a huge way .
i had the chance a little while back to ride in the google autonomous car , which is as cool as it sounds .
so at the risk of repeating myself a little bit , when i look at what &apos;s going on with digital technology these days , we are not anywhere near through with this journey , and when i look at what is happening to our economies and our societies , my single conclusion is that we ain &apos;t seen nothing yet . the best days are really ahead .
thanks very much .
this is 1983 .
now , what i took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness .
another new york project .
try not to get stuck doing the same thing -- or try not get stuck behind the computer all day .
the rest of you won &apos;t find my talk personally relevant , but i think that you will still find the subject fascinating .
and they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children , relatives and lifelong friends .
still a third reason is our american cult of youth , which shows up even in our advertisements .
today , just to watch a program on the tv set in my own house , i have to operate a 41-button tv remote that utterly defeats me .
hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising , administering , advising , strategizing , teaching , synthesizing , and devising long-term plans .
it &apos;s a story of intercultural intersections , and what better group to have this conversation than those that grew out of fighting fascism in their respective histories and geographies ?
but the mongols get there first .
and there &apos;s a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone , you get taken advantage of by people who will exploit your powers , okay .
mujiba , from malaysia : her main power is she &apos;s able to answer any question .
and we entered western consciousness with a tagline : &quot; next ramadan , the world will have new heroes , &quot; back in 2005 .
opened a theme park through a license in kuwait a year and a half ago called the 99 village theme park -- 300,000 square feet , 20 rides , all with our characters : a couple back-to-school licenses in spain and turkey .
don &apos;t we deserve to be saved ? don &apos;t i ?
the first one , they said saudi arabia . there was no debate .
as an undergrad at tufts university , we were giving away free falafel one day and , you know , it was middle east day or something .
you can literally see them .
let me point them out .
data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights , and it &apos;s all around us , and it can be mined very easily .
i wonder if i could make my life beautiful .
and that little square in the corner , a naught .7 percent , that &apos;s the amount we &apos;re actually aware of .
now you can also do this with soldiers .
now this image constitutes a huge amount of work .
and it feels just incredibly cool to do that .
and it &apos;s been split up in successive bits and a chord .
once you figure this out , you can really impress people at parties .
and he puts an exclamation mark , ok ? this is an awful lot of work .
you have a unique smell , a unique vibration .
in other words , no mirrors , no lasers , no prisms , no nonsense , just a tiny device , and he built this device . and this device uses electron tunneling .
there are some reckless people , but it &apos;s not worth it , ok ?
luca turin : the science of scent
even fund the basic research , because this is popularly recognized , in fact , as a big public good which private companies don &apos;t want to invest in , do that , but you know what ?
they spend on the d part of r &amp; amp ; d .
what the public sector did in all these examples i just gave you , and there &apos;s many more , which myself and other colleagues have been looking at , is doing much more than de-risking .
but also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state -- apple &apos;s a great example .
so , very quickly , when president obama said , &quot; i don &apos;t see why we can &apos;t have a one-page , plain english consumer credit agreement . &quot;
we looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transactions in plain english .
it seems that writers know that the child outside of family reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself to be .
it &apos;s kind of easy to patronize the past , to forego our responsibilities in the present .
i was starting to stay out a little bit late , etc . , etc .
i &apos;m 17 years old , and they had a padded cell .
literature has long been fascinated with fostered , adopted and orphaned children , from moses to cinderella to oliver twist to harry potter . so why do many parentless children feel compelled to hide their pasts ? poet and playwright lemn sissay tells his own moving story . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
do not tell me we can &apos;t do better than this .
why is it that when we had rotary phones , when we were having folks being crippled by polio , that we were teaching the same way then that we &apos;re doing right now ?
science . you have bill gates coming out and saying , &quot; look , this works , right ? we can do this . &quot;
we know health services matter .
now you &apos;ve got all of this test data from last year .
so here &apos;s the other issue that i just think we &apos;ve got to be concerned about .
and we &apos;ve got to do better . the evaluation , we have to start with kids earlier , we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people .
gc : well , you know , one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids , the same kids , these same vulnerable kids , when you get them in school , they drop out in record numbers .
i was the better at improvisation , you were the better at spinning the plates ; i was the better at procrastination , you were the better at quiet debate .
never return to the haunts of your youth .
what is gone is gone . now sleep .
all empires , by definition , are bumbling , shambolic , bullying , bureaucratic affairs , as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy , as they are corrupted by power in their dotage .
&quot; love came to visit me . &quot;
i wasn &apos;t allowed to see any of my -- you know , whatever .
our natures haven &apos;t changed a single iota .
we craved but to favor the hem of her dress .
and it &apos;s important to remember that , because the bonobos are so human , and they share 99 percent of their genes with us .
but now , let me take you back to africa , two million years ago .
and we were able to dig up , when we got old enough , fossils such as this , a slender-snouted crocodile .
we evolved essentially from an african stock .
my father so appropriately put it , that &quot; we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species . &quot;
i want to point out here at this point that i &apos;ve spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell , and this was the very latest one .
i wasn &apos;t thinking about a dodo skeleton ; i just noticed that as i finished this skull , the armature wire that i had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be .
then there is the fictional bird , the one that hammett created for the book .
oh , finishing up with triple-zero steel wool .
here , i &apos;m going to put it out there , later on tonight , and i want you to pick it up and handle it .
that &apos;s what defined me . that was my bliss .
i had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above as if it was happening to someone else .
you have no feeling from the waist down , and at most , you might get 10- or 20-percent return .
and even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward , there were moments of incredible depth and richness , of authenticity and connection that i had never experienced before .
and then i remembered my friends that were still in the spinal ward , particularly maria .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s nice , dear . &quot;
i said , &quot; but i can use my hands , &quot; and he said , &quot; okay . &quot;
and then i got my instructor rating .
i was hanging on to have a pee .
impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it : 100 million dollars , easily , for a monet .
in the future they will look like that , because we need to move away from those type of polymers and use that for medical equipment and more important things , perhaps , in life .
actually , i put marijuana in everything i cooked -- -- and i had access to all the best girls . it was fabulous .
it takes away anything extraneous . that &apos;s what i do .
it &apos;s for a company called moroso in italy .
that &apos;s the weird side coming out again , and a lot of companies don &apos;t understand that .
a three-wheeled car : slow , feminine , transparent , so you can see the people in there . you drive different .
lean , efficient things . healthy products .
like i say , it &apos;s a cross between natural history museum and a nasa laboratory . it &apos;s full of prototypes and objects .
it sounds like some quiz show or something , doesn &apos;t it ?
and inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that &apos;s about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye , albeit a little fuzzy .
another thing all these molecules are telling us that , apparently , bioluminescence has evolved at least 40 times , maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolutionary history , which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival .
these are the eyes of a living anglerfish .
so i &apos;m holding it , and i &apos;m about to touch that tube on its shoulder , and when i do , you &apos;ll see bioluminescence coming out .
you can &apos;t use infrared in the sea .
eighty-six seconds after it went into its pinwheel display , we recorded this : this is a squid , over six feet long , that is so new to science , it cannot be placed in any known scientific family .
well , when you design an object that &apos;s supposed to interact with a human being , if you make a foam model of a mobile phone , it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
so you have situations like this , where some people in chile decided to make their own boards instead of buying them , to organize a workshop and to save money . or there are companies that make their own variations of arduino that fit in a certain market , and there &apos;s probably , maybe like a 150 of them or something at the moment .
or this is a project from the itp part of nyu , where they met with this boy who has a severe disability , cannot play with the ps3 , so they built this device that allows the kid to play baseball although he has limited movement capability .
they learned how to program and to make robots when they were probably , like , 11 , and then they started to use arduino to make these robots that play football . they became world champions by making an arduino-based robot .
thank you .
if you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot;
and this is what i saw when i looked out of the window .
i got a phone call from a person called marc abrahams , and he told me , &quot; you &apos;ve won a prize with your duck paper : the ig nobel prize . &quot;
it &apos;s a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison .
he sees an intruder in his territory , and it &apos;s coming all the time and he &apos;s there , so there is no end to it .
this is the sound of a dirty sock .
also , the way i perceive beauty has changed , because when i look at someone , i hear their face , so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible .
i was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel .
it &apos;s a little bit like the invasion of the body snatchers .
you wouldn &apos;t want to say something off-the-cuff that might be used against you . &quot;
it &apos;s not the basis of the rule of law , it &apos;s not the basis of a free society .
public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in america say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom .
five-inch fishing lure , it &apos;s a big fishing lure , with a three pronged hook in the back , and outside it said , &quot; harmful if swallowed . &quot;
so , what &apos;s needed is not just to limit claims , but actually create a dry ground of freedom .
because life is complex , and here is the hardest and biggest change : we have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law .
if the environmental agency can &apos;t decide that the power lines are good for the environment , then there &apos;s no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city .
give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes , so that you don &apos;t need to rely on judges using their judgment .
we need people who want to do the right thing .
so it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of yourself .
he did . he served out his sentence .
so ms. dewey heard this , and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on and nodding approvingly .
we think , ken and i , that there are real sources of hope .
it was a court only for veterans who had broken the law .
and the way they do it is to give third-year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year .
barry schwartz : using our practical wisdom
our target audience , it &apos;s not just the producers of terrorism , as i &apos;ve said , the terrorists .
he &apos;s going to take to alcohol , and he &apos;s probably there &apos;s a very young , attractive lady over here , and she has something which i think &apos;s the worst form of psychological , physical injury i &apos;ve ever seen out of a suicide bombing : it &apos;s human shrapnel .
there &apos;s a bomb , people start suing .
the advantages of dialogue are obvious .
thank you .
it was characterized by a nation-versus-nation , very fragile standoff .
now , the bomb shelters at that point -- let &apos;s say you bought a prefab one -- it would be a few hundred dollars , maybe up to 500 , if you got a fancy one .
and what happened was -- when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era , which started back in 1945 .
now , plutonium , 10 to 13 pounds : this . this is enough plutonium to create a nagasaki-size atomic weapon .
the fourth element is that the high-value u.s. targets are accessible , soft and plentiful .
i &apos;m back in my truck , and we drove over the brooklyn bridge .
if you can &apos;t get out of there , we want you to go into a shelter and stay there .
and shelter and place . you want to move downwind or crosswind for 1.2 miles .
why are we having so much trouble dealing with these problems ?
we &apos;ve been aware of these problems for decades .
how are those resources really created , the resources we &apos;re going to need to deal with all these societal challenges ?
business should be more responsible .
it saves money .
it &apos;s capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be , meeting important needs , not incrementally competing for trivial differences in product attributes and market share .
so to address this , we developed with a dr. brown in stanford : virtual dissection table .
let &apos;s say i &apos;m going to cut the liver right here .
so when you are done , just bring back the body and then it &apos;s ready for another session .
after this , they were scientists , professionals with a particular scientific method , goals , societies and funding .
for example , ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports .
and for the first time , they gave women a foot in the door of science .
so i have a strange career .
and he goes , &quot; right , that &apos;s life too . i know that . &quot;
and that explains why that nasa manager was actually in my office to begin with .
but what is this system like ?
and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .
the avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity .
and i &apos;m just showing this to you again because it &apos;s so nice .
so the cop takes his time and looks over and kind of makes a little matrix and looks for about two , three minutes . no keys .
we have paper forms for vaccination surveys .
now 1995 , obviously that was quite a long time ago .
and the main obstacle , it turned out , and this is a sad realization , the main obstacle was me .
you just have to hear about it and go to the website .
camfed , another charity based out of the u.k. , camfed pays girls &apos; families to keep them in school .
and in that sense , ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .
life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three dimensions .
and he told me , &quot; don &apos;t do that . go down immediately in order to slow down . &quot;
it &apos;s to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles .
that means to load the batteries during the flight , in order to spend the night on the batteries , and fly the next day again .
and one month ago we have unveiled it .
the success will not come if we &quot; just , &quot; quote , unquote , fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane .
but still , i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t be with you in person .
another very tall , grizzled rock star , my friend sir bob geldof , issued a challenge to &quot; feed the world . &quot;
that &apos;s not a cause . that &apos;s an emergency .
it questions our commitment .
&quot; the war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty . &quot;
but that &apos;s just the easy part , or ought to be .
this room was born for this moment , is really what i want to say to you tonight .
we &apos;re calling it the one campaign .
that &apos;s really what i would like you to do .
the ones that ted has offered to grant .
that &apos;s one billion media hits .
one , by one , by one .
bono : my wish : three actions for africa
and metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of juliet than if shakespeare had literally described what she looks like .
sexually attractive people are hot .
those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that price trends would continue .
ralph waldo emerson described language as &quot; fossil poetry . &quot;
these women are learning about first aid and their rights according to the constitution .
then you would know that there &apos;s so much to it .
it &apos;s about proving who you are and what you can do .
and i need to prove to them that , yes , you can still be married , you can still be a mother , and you can still be respected within the society , but at the same time , that doesn &apos;t mean you &#91; should &#93; just be one of the crowd .
yeah , break dancing .
and the very best of luck to you .
it &apos;s a mile high , and i grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters and two adoring parents .
a few days after arriving , i met this wonderful , old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles .
if it didn &apos;t , i &apos;d probably see my father sooner than i anticipated .
they were from texas .
whether by a mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs , death happens .
one is that you and i all have between 30 to 50,000 chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didn &apos;t have .
and you can see these large , yolked-up eggs bursting through the surface of this male &apos;s testes .
and for those of you who are not parents , sippy cups are those little plastic things that your child graduates to after using bottles .
in addition to that , after the baby &apos;s born , our other unique invention as mammals is that we nourish our offspring after they &apos;re born .
and it &apos;s sometimes a weird place when the communicator becomes part of the story , which is not what you originally intend .
and i kept thinking over and over again this question .
here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the l.a. airport .
i offered five cents each for bottle caps .
we simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff .
and it &apos;s a very effective way of ending your hate mail : &quot; love markham , aged 4 . &quot; still works .
and that goes for every single person in this room .
he &apos;s called andré pannison , and he basically took the twitter conversation in tahrir square on the day that hosni mubarak would eventually resign , and the dots you can see are retweets , so when someone retweets a message , a connection is made between two dots , and the more times that message is retweeted by other people , the more you get to see these nodes , these connections being made .
so if you look in the video , there &apos;s the big umbrella , there &apos;s a white lilo in the pool , there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool , and there &apos;s two trees in the background .
so onto google maps we go , and we start looking through literally every single bridge .
markham nolan : how to separate fact and fiction online
and maybe about here , about 30 feet , is the diameter of a big redwood .
after three books on this , it got to be a bit much , in a way .
and all of a sudden , you lose sight of the ground , and you also lose sight of the sky , and you &apos;re in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil , which is populated with all kinds of small organisms .
there &apos;s the person , right there . the person is waving to us .
there are some interesting theories that , if i had time , i would tell you about .
we are human , and we have the capacity to love , we have the capacity to wonder , and we have a sort of boundless curiosity , a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates , i think .
this is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency .
a doctor comes in from a block away , stop us , checks the kid , and tells us to stop cpr .
when i got there , the 70-year-old man was lying on the floor , blood was gushing out of his neck .
and this is a great technology we use all over the country and reduce the response time .
when my own father collapsed a few years ago from a cardiac arrest , one of the first volunteers to arrive to save my father was one of these muslim volunteers from east jerusalem who was in the first course to join hatzalah .
think about everything it has brought us .
and i knocked on the door .
so it used to be fairly easy to know that you &apos;re infected by a virus , when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .
same thing with every single password and so on .
they will switch from one country to another , from one jurisdiction to another -- moving around the world , using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
and we have a couple of russian guys in our labs , and one of them mentioned , well , it ends in rus like russia .
you &apos;ve all heard about things like stuxnet .
we have to do this globally , and we have to do it right now .
in order to look out for what &apos;s best for them or what they think is best for them , people have values -- they identify what they want , and what they don &apos;t want .
there &apos;s a good reason that we don &apos;t do that , and there &apos;s a good reason that using game theory and computers , we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people .
so , what do we need to know in order to predict ?
how secure is the theocratic regime in iran ?
over here you can see this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today , this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of 2010 , early parts of 2011 .
i love that you put it out there .
this heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works .
and the song , 18 months old , went back to number four on the itunes charts .
thank you .
we will not be there .
sometimes i &apos;d be with mau on a cloud-covered night and we &apos;d sit at the easternmost coast of the island , and he would look out , and then he would say , &quot; okay , we go . &quot;
and i realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way .
or are you running the same pattern ? because i believe that the invisible force of internal drive , activated , is the most important thing in the world .
that &apos;s &quot; how do you take the invisible and make it visible , &quot; right ?
but if you ask people , why didn &apos;t you achieve something ?
but i appreciated the energy , i &apos;ll tell you that .
what shapes you ? two invisible forces . very quickly . one : state .
everyone needs certainty that they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable . now , how do you get it ?
now , you can get significance a million ways , but to be significant , you &apos;ve got to be unique and different .
second -- but this is what changed my life , this is what shaped me as a human being -- &quot; somebody &apos;s gift .
how many of you know somebody who no matter what happens finds a way to get pissed off ? how many know somebody like this ?
jewish man with family in the occupied territory , someone in new york who would have died if he was at work that day , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and made it very clear .
thomas dolby : &quot; love is a loaded pistol &quot;
all of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day .
&quot; i feel like i &apos;m in this fog of depression that i can &apos;t get out of . &quot;
the final movement is called mounds .
they &apos;re just living life , and they end up just acting like that .
zeus battling chronos for control of mount olympus .
it &apos;s using the api of a really great company that i work with in new york , actually , called daylife .
we can also see the superstars . these would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of bill clinton . so there &apos;s bill clinton , hillary , iraq , george bush , barack obama , scooter libby -- these are kind of the people of bill clinton .
they get a bad rap .
and you look up and what do you see ?
it &apos;s like a bit of everyday meditation .
to be there is to be connected in the driving rain and the hail , to feel connected to our atmosphere .
and this is our beast of burden -- this is a computer tomography machine , a ct machine .
there is the problem . &quot;
i paid about one million dollars for that machine .
and you can see how i &apos;m gradually peeling off .
here you can see that knife went through the heart .
it &apos;s a little mechanical pen that has very , very fast step motors inside of the pen .
now this is really an interesting project .
and connecting also with the previous talk here , this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working , how the brain is working , and we can do this with very , very high visual quality and very fast resolution .
so thank you very much .
and fundamentally , design should be much , much more interested in solving problems and creating new conditions .
and that &apos;s a good thing .
and what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house onto which you can then apply systems like windows and cladding and insulation and services based on what &apos;s cheap and what &apos;s available .
they &apos;re self-made cities in one form or another .
when they were released , we left and we went as refugees to kenya and tanzania .
well -- -- i hadn &apos;t thought of that one .
but the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely unsolved .
the density of matter is finite , and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process .
and the next map now shows africa &apos;s gdp in 1960 , around the time of independence for many african states .
well , as a cambridge professor , i had many contacts .
everyone lives together in this hotel -- lecturers and students -- and it &apos;s not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 a.m .
tendai mugwagwa : my name is tendai mugwagwa .
i want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture .
and here are the ones we &apos;ve selected .
and i thought to myself , this cpu really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system .
so that &apos;s the question . the question is , how much -- they are doing a similar amount of processing , similar amount of data -- the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use ?
and nobody was listening then , but now people are beginning to listen because there &apos;s a pressing , technological problem that we face .
and that means that a transistor corresponds to about 12 ion channels in parallel .
and it &apos;s brittle , because each of these steps has to be flawless , otherwise you lose that data , whereas in the brain , you have a system that stores data in a distributed way , and it &apos;s robust .
and these four types of information -- your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it , and 900,000 of those fibers send these four types of information .
and i think you &apos;re going to be able to see , use that infusion , to come up with new things , because you &apos;re coming from a different perspective .
this is a virtual radius , not reality ; the black hole has no size .
and inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the sun .
and if there is a supermassive black hole , what we need to assume is that it &apos;s a black hole on a diet .
and that is because of the atmosphere .
so , there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff in there .
in fact , we anticipated that star formation shouldn &apos;t proceed in that environment .
and this means that these things do exist in our universe , and we have to contend with this , we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world .
one day in new york , i was on the street and i saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants .
and the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries , as have our preferences for them .
and every musical era had different priorities of these things , different things to pass on , different &apos; whats &apos; and &apos; hows &apos; .
turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words .
it spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like caruso and bessie smith were on the same footing .
there &apos;s just a role here for so many people -- teachers , parents , performers -- to be explorers together .
and their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion , where we powered up and took off for the first-ever 12-second human flight .
so you ask , how big are those machines ?
and the song that i just played was by józef hofmann .
like , am i going to use one page ?
gh : you &apos;re welcome . and what about these ?
here &apos;s a clue .
the second thing you need is light .
it &apos;s the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire , but the light and desire are a lethal one-two combination that attract new people to the crowd .
we spark off each other .
i mean , there &apos;s a lot of passion right here on this screen .
500 years ago , it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage .
schools can &apos;t be silos .
the same trash site is feeding more than 30 families .
so if you came here to talk about how french coffee will spread happiness in our brains , that &apos;s a go .
for example , fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color , much more than the average tedtalk .
so we &apos;ve all heard of mris . mris use magnetic fields and radio waves and they take snapshots of your brain or your knee or your stomach , grayscale images that are frozen in time .
we have a behavioral superpower in our brain , and it at least in part involves dopamine .
it engages deep systems in our brain , in dopaminergic systems that are there to make you chase sex , food and salt .
these kinds of probes exploit it . okay ?
the fact is , though , that even when we &apos;re alone , we &apos;re a profoundly social creature . we &apos;re not a solitary mind built out of properties that kept it alive in the world independent of other people . in fact , our minds depend on other people . they depend on other people , and they &apos;re expressed in other people , so the notion of who you are , you often don &apos;t know who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people that are close to you , people that are enemies of you , people that are agnostic to you .
the first is this : we believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives , if you give people more choice , if you put them in the driving seat , then actually , you can create a stronger and better society .
it had sucked all that power up from the localities .
and the third of these big changes : accountability .
how do we make it happen ?
i &apos;m talking about teachers .
now , they rank number one across the board , in reading , math and science , and one of the keys to shanghai &apos;s incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving .
my name is sarah brown wessling .
for example , i know some teachers aren &apos;t immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom .
it &apos;s a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone , not just scientists and people in government labs .
we hack hardware , software , wetware , and , of course , the code of life .
but like diybio , the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk .
it just has to follow safety guidelines .
he was infected with hiv .
these laws ensure that people living with hiv and those at greatest risk are protected from violence and discrimination and that they get access to prevention and to treatment .
i am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me .
in fact , one in every 10 new infections of hiv is among people who inject drugs .
but there &apos;s plenty you can do while that process is underway .
and for hundreds , even thousands of years , the home was really the center of life .
more than half the people now in the world live in cities , and that will just continue to escalate .
not to pick on pittsburgh , but most american cities really have evolved this way .
but shared use is really key . if you share a vehicle , you can have at least four people use one vehicle , as opposed to one .
developers say , okay , we &apos;ll build little teeny apartments .
blue light is very efficient , so we have these tunable 24-bit led lighting fixtures .
how can we fit more people into cities without overcrowding ? kent larson shows off folding cars , quick-change apartments and other innovations that could make the city of the future work a lot like a small village of the past .
and the fishermen would tie a net off the headland , string it out along the other net .
and that &apos;s a lovely , evocative name .
this is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end .
all he knows is where he tagged them and he knows where they popped off .
so even though basking sharks are found throughout the world , you couldn &apos;t tell the difference genetically from one from the pacific , the atlantic , new zealand , or from ireland , south africa .
we were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets .
but i kept emailing , saying , &quot; have you had a chance to look at my slime yet ? &quot;
and what you &apos;re trying to look at is the males have claspers , which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark .
have you ever been divorced ?
so i went home , and i shaved my head , and i came back the next day and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a boy . &quot;
when i was 15 , and i called my father to tell him that i had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
obviously i couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so i figured out a way where i could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
i want to take the project across the country .
people didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
so is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
one , the world is , was , will always be filled with good and evil , because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition .
i had access to him . i could study him , have him come to my home , get to know him , do psychological analysis to see , was he a good apple or bad apple .
so how do psychologists go about understanding such transformations of human character , if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon ?
like yourself , i &apos;m a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not , depending on the circumstances . &quot;
you &apos;re a good person . you complain .
most of the time , we are in institutions , so the stanford prison study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior .
they strip them naked . they sexually taunt them .
uncritical conformity to group norms .
aleksandr solzhenitsyn says , &quot; the line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being . &quot;
i just came to my senses , obviously .
and the moral imperative is &quot; i did what everyone should do . &quot;
all the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience , this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation , has got major controversies .
we have a me that is automatically present in our minds right now .
and that is exactly what causes the warping of my visual image .
there is just one reference point , which is the body .
i promise not to say anything about this , except this is to frighten you .
the autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made ; it &apos;s the lived past and the anticipated future .
i was raised on &quot; free to be you and me &quot; -- hip-hop -- not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house .
i thought they were really hot .
i say , &quot; samhita mukhopadhyay , miriam perez , ann friedman , jessica valenti , vanessa valenti , and on and on and on and on . &quot;
there &apos;s a writer i &apos;ve been deeply influenced by , parker palmer , and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed &quot; between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves . &quot;
she was talking about board meetings , she was founding peace organizations , she was coordinating carpools , she was consoling friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .
if you think about it , this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s called thought-controlled computing .
we were making things activate , light up and work just by thinking .
so the goal of the original game zen bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form .
so you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their add symptoms as they do it .
and from this , we can learn how to change the plot , the outcome and the character of our personal stories .
and my little sister wanted to be a pilot -- god help her .
and when i want to look beautiful , i step three feet away from the mirror , and i don &apos;t have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting i &apos;ve done all my life from all the dark lights .
and then i went to business school .
and please , any designers out there ?
now listen , i wasn &apos;t going to say to him , &quot; well , i wanted to race cars and motorbikes . &quot;
because who am i going to be ?
and so i got off that rock , and , oh my god , did i run home .
i left , and i became a social entrepreneur , and i set up an organization with mark shand called elephant family , which deals with asian elephant conservation .
i no longer want anybody to be invisible .
and i loved game shows , fascinated with game shows .
i don &apos;t think they know that , luckily , but i would go back and play for arby &apos;s coupons .
and i saw this line coming for me .
it had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer .
i have read that there &apos;s now actually evidence that the hippocampus , the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships , physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like gps , because we &apos;re not exercising our sense of direction anymore .
according to a national geographic survey i just saw , somewhere along the lines of 80 percent of the people who vote in a u.s. presidential election about issues like foreign policy cannot find iraq or afghanistan on a map .
it &apos;s like they took the time to get to know you before you even met .
we make that choice by being curious , inquisitive people who like to learn , who don &apos;t just say , &quot; well , as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over , i don &apos;t have to learn anymore , &quot; or &quot; thank goodness i have my diploma . i &apos;m done learning for a lifetime .
so the power of reframing things cannot be overstated .
we ask the question -- the whole debate in the western world is about the level of taxation .
you know my example of the eurostar .
you &apos;re 200 yards away , you realize you &apos;ve got five seconds to go , you floor it .
the likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle .
praxeology is the study of human choice , action and decision making .
they decided this wasn &apos;t good enough and they wanted to get it up to 99 .
the circumstances of our lives may matter less than how we see them , says rory sutherland . at tedxathens , he makes a compelling case for how reframing is the key to happiness . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
the environments we are living in , more typically , are like these .
probably the most significant public space failure in america , designed by the leading architects of the day , harry cobb and i.m. pei : boston city hall plaza .
the message is : we don &apos;t give a fuck ! we don &apos;t give a fuck .
and that &apos;s it . those are the four jobs of the street trees .
we know that little skippy is loading his uzi down here , getting ready for homeroom .
and we should have started two days before yesterday .
please , please , stop referring to yourselves as &quot; consumers . &quot; ok ?
i never did have someone . &quot;
i feel like the happiest person on earth &quot; &quot; one of these men is the father of my son .
&quot; i found your camera at lollapalooza this summer .
they can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we &apos;ll never meet again .
it &apos;s a six-day immersive experience for the kids .
hi . so , this chap here , he thinks he can tell you the future .
these drugs were brought to market . they were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal , over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in america from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs .
only three of the negative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published .
and the most staggering thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recognize that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suffer fake fixes .
nasa supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the hayden planetarium so that we would share this with the world .
we have a growing user base of this , and we network domes .
so , with the mit media lab , for quite a while now , we &apos;ve been engaged in a field called active music .
so we know , for instance , that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced alzheimer &apos;s can still respond to .
the main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character . it becomes his legacy .
dan ellsey : hello . my name is dan ellsey . i am 34 years old and i have cerebral palsy .
tm : so let &apos;s do it . so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you &apos;re going to play now ?
now you would expect , given that , that they would choose an alternate route around the sirens , but instead odysseus says , &quot; i want to hear that song .
because there &apos;s two heads inside one person when you think about it .
now i &apos;m a big fan of commitment devices actually .
you say , &quot; well , of course i can &apos;t write today , because i &apos;m giving a tedtalk and i have five media interviews , and then i &apos;m going to a cocktail party and then i &apos;ll be drunk after that .
the first is called the distribution builder .
the last thing i &apos;ll show you , the last behavioral time machine , is something that i created with hal hershfield , who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project , bill sharpe .
we &apos;re going to see if this has an effect on what people do .
that &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the turks .
x is the unknown because you can &apos;t say &quot; sh &quot; in spanish .
but beyond the staggering numbers , what &apos;s truly important from a global health point of view , what &apos;s truly worrying from a global health point of view , is that the vast majority of these affected individuals do not receive the care that we know can transform their lives , and remember , we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions , medicines , psychological interventions , and social interventions , can make a vast difference .
similarly , using a randomized control trial in rural pakistan , atif rahman and his colleagues showed that lady health visitors , who are community maternal health workers in pakistan &apos;s health care system , could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers who were depressed , again showing dramatic differences in the recovery rates . roughly 75 percent of mothers recovered as compared to about 45 percent in the comparison villages .
but we need to do something about this problem .
and the answer is zilch , exactly zero .
that &apos;s the difference .
and if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries , the fish nurseries , that provide fish for the poor , that answer is more like $ 11,000 .
that &apos;s how my interests began and went to the teeb project .
that &apos;s an example , i think , for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from .
we have the means already in our hands , through a structure , through a mechanism , called redd plus -- a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation .
he was a man of many , many parts .
i remember once he told me a story about a joke that the students played on him .
well , what do you talk about when you talk about minds ?
i don &apos;t think he was right .
so , well he did .
and unfortunately , the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other .
they &apos;re difficult integrals .
how should we really honor feynman ?
what i had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell .
the trailers themselves are actually hand-built .
and despite all of our best efforts and intentions , kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can , in whatever environment they can .
i first saw this in a canadian film board film when i was 10 , and it left a lasting impression , to see babies playing with knives .
it &apos;s a very simple exercise -- buy a song on itunes , write it to a cd , then rip the cd to an mp3 and play it on your very same computer .
it &apos;s not true . i &apos;ve traveled the whole length and breadth of this country .
the trouble is , it &apos;s all going in the wrong direction .
children are not , for the most part , suffering from a psychological condition .
he used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of verbs .
it &apos;s why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic .
now people always say , &quot; well , you know , you can &apos;t compare finland to america . &quot;
and the reason i think is this : that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions of education .
death valley is the hottest , driest place in america , and nothing grows there .
so let me just start with my story .
and it works , not just for my wife , but certainly for other patients .
and there &apos;s a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending .
this is an example of a real meteorite , and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth , and just how much of it survives and melts .
they got you out of purgatory faster .
there is a glass bridge that you walk across that &apos;s suspended in space .
and once we create new patterns in this brain , once we shape the brain in a new way , it never returns to its original shape .
i usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say , that &apos;s really cool , but what &apos;s it good for ?
course , like light , it &apos;s great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack , or the cornflakes , or the toothpaste , or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby .
so , we create silence as much as we create sound .
now , the question is , where &apos;s the sound made ?
we sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars , and they &apos;re buying them as fast as we can make them .
if you haven &apos;t heard it , raise your hand .
it &apos;s indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very &#91; dynamically &#93; .
thank you .
i don &apos;t have time to explain it , but it has to do with dna and rna .
i &apos;ve been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life .
for some reason , i thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission in my talk .
just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile , and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing .
and &quot; what does it do ? &quot;
what if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did , in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure , using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment ?
so nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale .
and so he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit .
we engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes .
and what we &apos;ve found is through genetic engineering , we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems .
when i ask people -- and i &apos;ve been asking people this question for about 10 years -- i ask them , &quot; where do you go when you really need to get something done ? &quot;
i did these conference calls . i did all this stuff .
so you have to go back a few phases and start again .
you decide when you want to turn something on .
that &apos;s kind of bad .
you can &apos;t . i don &apos;t even know if you can .
giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable .
so thanks for listening .
it &apos;s kind of like stalking with permission .
however , for these things to help us survive , it depends on them being carried .
maybe sometime in the future , we will .
you take a 10 or 20 percent commission , and then you -- the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission , and passes the rest over to you in cash .
it challenges the norms .
and it &apos;s not necessarily the same values , but some kind of values of livestrong , to actually go out and purchase them , and actually display them .
what i wanted to talk to you about today is two things : one , the rise of a culture of availability ; and two , a request .
look around you .
some of my favorite things , like chocolate and tea , blueberries , alcohol in moderation , stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana .
well , our genes are not our fate , and if we make these changes -- they &apos;re a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise , we can actually change how our genes are expressed .
in other words , i had drunk our great cultural kool-aid about regret , which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past is an absolute waste of time , that we should always look forward and not backward , and that one of the noblest and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets .
i should have gone through that yellow light . &quot;
but it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways .
and then i thought about how , much as travel insurance doesn &apos;t cover acts of god , probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy .
and the first of these is to take some comfort in its universality .
so let me reassure you about something .
even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing .
none in china . there are now 250,000 registered with the government , probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons .
we started a childhood obesity initiative with the heart association in america .
because the longer i deal with these problems , the more convinced i am that we have to -- whether it &apos;s economics , health , education , whatever -- we have to build systems .
she was ceo of a successful e-venture -- she started and built reed elsevier ventures -- and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life .
and the most important thing is because we &apos;ve implemented paul farmer &apos;s model , using community health workers , we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of rwanda for between five and six percent of gdp , and that the government could sustain that without depending on foreign aid after five or six years .
i had a really hard time in school .
our children spend 181 days going to school in a box .
and as long as we &apos;re taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water -- you &apos;re all really smart , just do the math .
we had to look at everything .
the kids are from 25 countries .
on giant grass .
and you just have to follow these simple , simple rules : be local , let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build .
the first surgery was a great success .
then apple released the alex voice , which was the best i &apos;d heard .
and it sounded like me , it really did .
but i &apos;ve got to say , in first grade , they said i talked too much , and now i still can .
this was a computer-assisted instruction system , which in those days ran on a computer named illiac .
and because of it , i can communicate as well as i ever could .
you should never let your wife read something like this .
a human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer .
i decided to be -- to work for them as an art director .
flipping through pages is readers experience , and i &apos;m responsible for this experience .
but soon they realized that this is the new role of designer : to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end .
so as part of organizing this and whatever , this commemoration , the police will round us up as they call us leaders .
i ended up with blunt chest trauma .
so they basically put a map up on the wall , threw a dart , and it landed at a senior home here in colorado .
but i did say no to the blue hair .
and i was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me , and also the guide dog and skill set i had gained .
he was a well-known revolutionary in paris at the time .
and if i ask you which of these you find more beautiful , you &apos;re probably drawn to the lower two .
and he referred me to this lovely quote from the japanese &quot; essays in idleness &quot; from the 14th century , in which the essayist wrote , &quot; in everything , uniformity is undesirable .
it looks like it did before it started .
so , this object has six symmetries .
well let &apos;s do that . a sixth of a turn , followed by a third of a turn , the combined effect is as if i had just rotated it by half a turn in one go .
you don &apos;t see any symmetry twice in any row or column .
here is another example in the alhambra .
if you &apos;ve got it as a factorial , you &apos;ve got to expand the factorials .
so , what is your name ?
it was really bad news .
what we find is , no longer simple tools , but systems .
so the 20th century , then , saw how much more complex reality was , but it also saw a positive side .
so it shows that we &apos;re really all in this together .
we need to take a really positive view .
the space bar scrolls down one page .
so it turns out there &apos;s a keyboard shortcut that lets you jump directly to the beep like this .
it &apos;s extremely frustrating on any camera under 1,000 dollars .
and once things are in a pile i can browse them by throwing them into a grid , or you know , flip through them like a book or i can lay them out like a deck of cards .
so i can pile things up , i can flip through it , i can , you know -- okay , let &apos;s move this photo to the back , let &apos;s delete this guy here , and i think it &apos;s just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information .
but it &apos;s now your turn .
and he said , &quot; well we were mostly breaking stealth . &quot;
and algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the united states air force had , which is that they &apos;re moving these positions -- whether it &apos;s proctor &amp; amp ; gamble or accenture , whatever -- they &apos;re moving a million shares of something through the market .
you may have noticed it when its price started at 1.7 million dollars .
and if these algorithms , like the algorithms on wall street , just crashed one day and went awry , how would we know ?
and they operate on milliseconds and microseconds .
it &apos;s what the money motivates , that we &apos;re actually terraforming the earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency .
joe smith : your word is &quot; fold . &quot;
you will for the rest of your life remember those words every time you pick up a paper towel .
but the other two are somewhat questionable .
well the meaning of yield is : you must yield the right-of-way .
any tough problem , i think it can be solved .
people didn &apos;t know what caused it until the early 1900s , when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitos .
those mosquitos are not infected .
of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise .
over 30 percent of kids never finish high school .
and so you &apos;d say , &quot; wow , we should reward those people .
you might say , &quot; do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher &apos;s leave ? &quot;
well , in a normal school , teachers aren &apos;t told how good they are .
now there &apos;s a book actually , about kipp -- the place that this is going on -- that jay matthews , a news reporter , wrote -- called , &quot; work hard , be nice . &quot;
i would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke .
he had to embrace this challenge , and i use that word intentionally . he didn &apos;t have to overcome dyslexia .
you know where this story goes .
creativity is essential to all of us , whether we &apos;re scientists or teachers , parents or entrepreneurs .
i knew i wasn &apos;t ready . i knew i had to quit . &quot;
see , why not ? we celebrate birthdays , where all you have to do is not die for 365 days — — and yet we let people who have made our lives better walk around without knowing it .
when i make an incision inside a patient &apos;s body , it &apos;s dark .
that &apos;s what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient &apos;s on the table .
so imagine that you make a solution full of this sticky material and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer , everything &apos;s going to get lit up .
and i &apos;m peeling that muscle away .
well with our technology , the surgeon is able to tell immediately which nodes have cancer .
so there &apos;s that teamwork thing again .
they said , &quot; wow !
and they are brought inside by humans and other creatures .
why does this matter ?
it &apos;s one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia .
now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain .
when blue light hits it , it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot , and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery .
the brain will do more of whatever got that reward .
and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we &apos;re working on now .
now i want to close on one story , which we think is another possibility -- which is that maybe these molecules , if you can do ultra-precise control , can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic , an optical prosthetic .
and because there &apos;s so many of these cells in the eye , potentially , they could be very high-resolution cameras .
juan enriquez : so some of the stuff is a little dense .
because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density , of largely urban density , of connecting people and putting them together in one place , and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together .
but nonetheless , just 20 blocks north , two days later , the city had never looked more alive .
there &apos;s one person putting up the link , and there &apos;s another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not .
and he says , the link to one site didn &apos;t just grow on the other page &quot; like a tree fungus . &quot;
i had no idea .
you know , 20 years before it was still , &quot; ask not what you can do , &quot; but with reagan , it &apos;s , &quot; that &apos;s where , there &apos;s nancy and i , &quot; that kind of language .
you &apos;re not totally in control , but you &apos;re changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices .
given the access to technology , even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a dvd onto a white board .
after all , jimmy stewart filibustered for two entire reels .
and they themselves had not known they cared .
and it &apos;s okay if we remember tom hanks better than astronaut jim lovell or have ben kingsley &apos;s face superimposed onto that of gandhi &apos;s .
it comes in california with a warning -- &quot; this product contains chemicals known by the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm . &quot;
so , the question is , how many federal officials are ready to move to ohio and pennsylvania with their families ?
we &apos;ve seen the first form of solar energy that &apos;s beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the great plains , and so that hegemony is leaving .
if we look at the world of architecture , we see with mies &apos; 1928 tower for berlin , the question might be , &quot; well , where &apos;s the sun ? &quot;
does it work ? do i like it ?
so we need materials in closed cycles , but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer , birth defects , mutagenic effects , disruption of our immune systems , biodegradation , persistence , heavy metal content , knowledge of how we &apos;re making them and their production and so on .
we saved ford 35 million dollars doing it this way , day one , which is the equivalent of the ford taurus at a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars .
we studied the biota , the ancient biota , the current farming and the protocols .
they &apos;ve changed the world .
they can monitor foreigners when foreigners &apos; data connections end up in the united states or pass through the united states .
you take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose , making all of us less secure as an end result .
der spiegel , from germany , leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies .
like , skype used to be secure .
and if we indeed need a big brother , i would much rather have a domestic big brother than a foreign big brother .
so mr. snowden , he &apos;s been blamed for many things .
20 percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs , 20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart , is servicing this one organ .
so as i mentioned , there are 86 billion neurons .
because what we &apos;re trying to measure , the rna -- which is the readout from our genes -- is very labile , and so we have to move very quickly .
you can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places .
they don &apos;t even have to log in to come use this tool , mine this data , find interesting things out with this .
one other thing you can do with such a thing is you can , because it &apos;s a pattern matching exercise , because there &apos;s unique fingerprint , we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint .
it &apos;s this dark purple precipitate within the cell that &apos;s telling us a gene is turned on there .
or maybe you turn to the past .
and the world has spent a lot of money on it : the gavi and the gates foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it , and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort .
but how do you do that ?
so if that &apos;s the case , that &apos;s difficult , because persuasion is really difficult .
that &apos;s full immunization .
and some people get 100 percent discount , and some people get 20 percent discounts , and some people get 50 percent discount , etc .
well , in business , that &apos;s certainly not the way we would go about it .
and i cut it into smaller questions , and i have the answer to these smaller questions .
deworming .
looking at fossils dating back several millions of years -- it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here .
and turnarounds are part and parcel of what i have focused on for most of my professional career .
and myth says that he had an audience with the oracle , and it foretold his destiny of greatness .
as an investment banker , i &apos;m in the cross-flow of information and the changes that are taking place in capital markets .
and i &apos;m very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in .
guarantee trust bank recently issued the first euro bond out of africa , and this excludes south africa .
again , gathering together farmers , gathering together stakeholders in east africa to get standards for organic produce . better prices .
south africa : in the 20 percents . high ones .
and think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly .
it creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard . and &quot; god &quot; ?
look at the faces of people whom you meet .
so this is our footage of the launch , based on , basically , taking notes , asking people what they thought , and then the combination of all the different shots and all the different things put together created their sort of collective consciousness of what they remembered it looked like , but not what it really looked like .
and he was looking at me . it &apos;s like , yeah , i don &apos;t know if you noticed , but i &apos;m the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of america &apos;s finest moments with fire extinguishers .
so , when you saw my footage , you were seeing this : basically , a bunch of guys flipping a ship upside down , and the little mir subs are actually about the size of small footballs , and shot in smoke .
i &apos;d love to but i can &apos;t , because it was invented like in 1910 or something like that , is i told marty , and it &apos;s kind of one of those mind things that it &apos;s really hard to really get until you actually see it work , and i said , you know , what i was going to do , and he said , &quot; so , let me see if i can get this straight . the thing with the wheels ?
ok , clap them together , once .
keith barry : kathryn , it &apos;s keith here . i &apos;m going to take you to a secret location , ok ?
kt : ok , ok , ok . oh , my god !
so , i stopped pretty quick , and that was it .
kb : nicole , and ?
nicole : a touch on my back .
allow your eyes to close , on five , four , three , two , one .
you can wait as long as you want , but only when you want the pressure released .
it depends on how much energy you have that day , so on and so forth .
and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side .
i &apos;ve got four wooden plinths here , steve .
now , i &apos;m going to put on the blindfold .
kb : oh , no , no , no . he asked me could he do the left hand . absolutely not .
thank you .
&quot; run like the wind , veruca ! run ! &quot;
here we &apos;ve got a little bit of long-term memory , so , you know that night you want to forget , when you got really drunk ? bye-bye ! gone .
thank you .
i did what most of us do -- i tried it on some colleagues .
i don &apos;t want to just ask people , &quot; are you trustworthy ? &quot;
that &apos;s not what we found .
but why do they do this ?
you sit in a gas station all day , you see lots of morality and immorality , let me tell you .
so this is a classic con called the pigeon drop , and i was the pigeon .
we don &apos;t need god or government telling us what to do .
so even though i have a fear of heights , i recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft .
i &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your prescription from dr. love : eight hugs a day .
the victorians were great engineers .
at the same time , we also had lots of parents , rich people , who had computers , and who used to tell me , &quot; you know , my son , i think he &apos;s gifted , because he does wonderful things with computers .
in an irritated voice , they said , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in english , so we had to teach ourselves english in order to use it . &quot;
i decided i would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
what will it be tomorrow ?
what happens to creativity in our age ?
it &apos;s about letting it happen .
and if he says , &quot; well , what ? how ? &quot;
it &apos;s very easy to do . there &apos;s a great document produced by ted which tells you how to do it .
and it &apos;s like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don &apos;t turn the thing off .
his land was no longer registered in his name .
and this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline .
instances of prominent social and political figures in polygamous relationships has led to the perception of polygamy as a symbol of wealth , status and power .
following those four children is zumra &apos;s younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well .
and finally , another individual sat for me from behind and later rescinded his participation , so i had to pixelate him out so he &apos;s unrecognizable .
children have to leave the orphanage at age 16 , despite the fact that there &apos;s often nowhere for them to go .
but anyway , it &apos;s just great to see such a full theater , and really i must thank herbie hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation .
so there , we experience the translation . now we &apos;ll experience the interpretation .
and i said , &quot; yes , i agree with that . so what &apos;s the problem ? &quot;
and i have to say , many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world .
but it &apos;s meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together . there are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics , dare i say . but by that i mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine .
if i can just say , &quot; please clap and create the sound of thunder . &quot;
so , heavens ! what was i to do ? i no longer required the sticks ; i wasn &apos;t allowed to have these sticks .
because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things .
and we &apos;ve gone from one board to 48 boards .
/ b / is the first board we started with , and it is , in many ways , the beating heart of the website .
and , you know , this didn &apos;t sit well with people , and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this .
i mean , for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment , there is plenty of bad .
now , i &apos;m not sure i would have necessarily recommended everyone at ted to go and check it out anyway .
sixty-five million years ago , a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land .
so there &apos;s lessons to learn , and there &apos;s lessons to learn from the exception , the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we &apos;ve made , and many other scholars have made around the world .
this is sort of a look at the skull , and it &apos;s an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long .
the ground surface at 150 -- typical .
we prototyped by cat-scanning the brain out of this animal .
watch out ! watch out ! no , no , no , no . you &apos;re going to have to get on the back legs .
we found this last year .
we have downgraded this factor .
i took a side trip to the american museum , and i never recovered .
because when you go out there as a scholar , and you try to find out longitudinal studies , track records like that , there essentially are very few , if none .
she &apos;s under the underdogs .
when the conquistadors arrived in north america you had two choices : you either fight back and engage or you could take off .
that would be an olympic event : turn a squirrel loose -- whoever catches the squirrel , you get a gold medal .
and then after that , you succumb to the rigors of time .
you need a pack to pull together .
and i think that , if anybody in here runs -- and i just had a conversation with carol ; we talked for two minutes backstage , and she &apos;s talking about plantar fasciitis .
i don &apos;t say let &apos;s go back to the copper canyons and live on corn and maize , which is the tarahumara &apos;s preferred diet , but maybe there &apos;s somewhere in between .
kismet : scientist : yeah , look , it &apos;s got a little blue light in it too .
well , one of the things that we &apos;ve learned is that , if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language , the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use -- like nexi , our humanoid robot , is doing here -- what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people .
the next was to add mobility -- so , have the screen on a mobile base .
but if robots can be engaging , if we like to cooperate with robots , if robots are persuasive , maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program , maybe they can help you manage your weight .
it turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more , even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer .
and now it &apos;s got number power .
parents say i shouldn &apos;t , but i knows i should .
while laying there dying , all he could say was , &quot; please man , don &apos;t take my air jordans away . &quot;
then one day i told him , &quot; reg e. , what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration ? &quot;
lemon andersen : please don &apos;t take my air jordans
and the camera can lie , and it makes it very , very easy with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths .
it was an april fool actually , and to this day some people think it &apos;s real .
because obviously the british public , i think , would prefer william to charles on the throne .
i suppose i come from a sort of non-humorous background with serious intent , and then suddenly my work is funny .
it involves the design of cities and the design of city streets .
it &apos;s probably not good for the fire hydrants .
it was like a star trek episode , you know ?
instead of waiting through years of planning studies and computer models to get something done , we &apos;ve done it with paint and temporary materials .
and you can see here that this strategy has worked .
and today , cyclists look like new york city looks .
most of this is in developing countries , and the majority is in africa .
if we can treat hypertension alone in africa , we &apos;ll save 250,000 lives a year . that &apos;s quite significant !
i have done businesses in healthcare in the united states -- i live in nashville , tennessee , health care capital of america .
technology is a great equalizer . how do we make it work ?
when we do it , we will put the cost of care down .
at least 4,000 rich jamaicans that were heading to miami for treatment have self-confessed that they did not go to miami because of the heart institute of the caribbean .
and anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation , we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we &apos;ve done it , and how you can do it . if we do this , we can change the face of health care in africa .
i &apos;m really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes , because art , and classes like that , those are the classes where i excelled .
and they come up one at a time , and then i think , &quot; ok , well maybe we can have it snow , or we can have a thunderstorm , &quot; and i can hold it there and turn them into videos .
gigantic mistake : i &apos;m finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra , go right to geometry and trig .
man on a horse and a man on the ground -- that is viewed as two totally different things .
and when the pilots walk around the plane , guess what ? they can &apos;t see that stuff inside the tail .
this is the work of dr. bruce miller .
the thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated .
and if you bring them in for internships in your companies , the thing about the autism , asperger-y kind of mind , you &apos;ve got to give them a specific task . don &apos;t just say , &quot; design new software . &quot;
tg : well let me tell you , that child will be loyal , and if your house is burning down , they &apos;re going to get you out of it .
so magic is a very introverted field .
you heard her , go ahead .
the most famous body of water on the earth today , i imagine , cuba to florida .
and each time i get done with ooh , you may say i &apos;m a dreamer but i &apos;m not the only one 222 .
and now the shore is coming , and there &apos;s just a little part of me that &apos;s sad .
thank you .
it &apos;s slow . it &apos;s antiquated . it &apos;s not using the best technology , and it &apos;s not using the best people .
they send him to iraq .
thank you very much .
what would this lead to ?
the scientific revolution wasn &apos;t created by the printing press .
this is linus torvalds .
this is cooperation without coordination .
you can go and pick your senator and then you can see a list of bills they have sponsored .
can we use them ?
i tried to come like him this morning , but as i walked out , then it was too cold , and i said , i &apos;d better put my shirt back on .
it branches on more the experimental side .
we started from those stars ; we are made of stardust .
if i zoom on it , you can see : that &apos;s the rover on the surface .
camera . we have a picture right now .
we &apos;re 70 miles above the surface of mars .
that &apos;s like taking two empire state buildings and stacking them on top of one another .
on the right , also , we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going .
what we are going to be doing with that rover as it drives around , it &apos;s going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks .
well , there were two satellites which were particularly interesting .
just looked like the coast of california for me .
you &apos;re all welcome to join .
these mobile phones have over 20,000 different mobile apps available -- to the point where there &apos;s one out of the u.k .
well now there &apos;s essentially a virtual colonoscopy .
here my friend jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so i can save her a trip to the emergency room -- i can do some diagnostics that way .
but it &apos;s going to be here .
and now both of these can climb better , move faster , swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal-abled persons .
put it on a chip , enable thousands of tests to be done at the point of care , anywhere in the world .
so genomics , proteomics , the environment , all this data streaming at us individually and us , as poor physicians , how do we manage it ?
we also have adult stem cells throughout our body .
daniel kraft : medicine &apos;s future ? there &apos;s an app for that
in those days , one hid much else as well : grown men didn &apos;t embrace one another , unless someone had died , and not always then ; you shook hands or , at a ball game , thumped your friend &apos;s back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection ; once out of childhood you &apos;d never again know the shock of your father &apos;s whiskers on your cheek , not until mores at last had evolved , and you could hug another man , then hold on for a moment , then even kiss ( your fathers bristles white and stiff now ) .
a cry so pure , practiced , detached , it had no need of a voice , or could no longer bear one .
something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders i devoured in those days .
a student , a young woman in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee , perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes ; a teacher passes and chides her , &quot; be careful , you might fall , &quot; almost banteringly chides her , &quot; you might fall , &quot; and the young woman , 18 , a girl really , though she wouldn &apos;t think that , as brilliant as she is , first in her class , and &quot; beautiful , too , &quot; she &apos;s often told , smiles back , and leans into the open window , which wouldn &apos;t even be open if it were winter -- if it were winter someone would have closed it -- leans into the window , farther , still smiling , farther and farther , though it takes less time than this , really an instant , and lets herself fall .
because there were images in it he said were licentious .
how she incarnates our desperate human need for regard , our passion to live in beauty , to be beauty , to be cherished by glances , if by no more , of something like love , or love .
the horrifying images from abu ghraib as well as the images from guantanamo had a profound impact .
i have one image in my office .
my first expedition was with a guy called pen hadow -- enormously experienced chap .
i was a failure .
the next bit in siberia to krasnoyarsk , on a russian internal airline called krasair , spelled k-r-a-s .
i got up in the morning , took the tent down , skied north for seven-and-a-half hours , put the tent up , and i was two and a half miles further back than when i &apos;d started .
it wasn &apos;t all high-tech . this is navigating in what &apos;s called a whiteout .
i finally got through to my mum . she was at the queue of the supermarket .
troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice ; we took a few photos . he climbed up the ladder . he said , &quot; just -- just get in the back . &quot;
the next question is , how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40 ?
and what &apos;s the brilliant idea he had ?
now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a schmuck .
because we don &apos;t see how conflicts of interest work on us .
neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard-wired to be optimists .
so the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner .
and humans , by the way , are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way , of projecting ourselves forward in time , and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling .
when the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships , less than half of the men were left alive , and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism .
now i know this is different than the way most people think about science .
i have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of marie curie , because i am convinced that that glow behind her is not a photographic effect .
in 2006 , there were 1.3 million papers published .
but all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts that we can somehow or another get completed .
i &apos;m going to show you a graph that shows up quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments .
so that maybe is not that interesting .
it might be easier to visualize them this way , so the gray circles are carbon atoms , the white ones are hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms .
they like to investigate things . they go to science museums .
that &apos;s the one i like in particular .
would you like to see foreign troops on your land ? &quot;
but we found that these people in the street , all of them are our reporters , feeding our newsroom with pictures , with videos and with news .
and then when they failed , they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from tel aviv and washington in order to divide the arab world .
the stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction .
in my opinion , these people are much more wiser than , not only the political elite , even the intellectual elite , even opposition leaders including political parties .
people do get hiv because they do stupid things , but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons .
&quot; oh yeah . &quot; hundred percent .
so we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest .
it &apos;s not that easy !
no one wants it .
and what we &apos;ve seen is that , actually , condom use rates , which were very , very high -- the gay community responded very rapidly to hiv , with extremely little help from public health nerds , i would say -- that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really : one is the assumption of , &quot; oh well , if he &apos;s infected , he &apos;s probably on meds , and his viral load &apos;s going to be low , so i &apos;m pretty safe . &quot;
and if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory , all would be well .
this is aunt zip from sodom , north carolina .
i &apos;ll lay around ; she &apos;ll make a living .
and he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built .
and , buddy , that made us mad .
don &apos;t want it to leave me behind . &quot;
well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
well , this is the steel guitar . it &apos;s an american-made instrument .
if you want to talk about it , you know , i will listen to you through .
so we looked in that -- this was a commercial chemistry set .
no problem . yeah , you know . &quot;
it took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea .
where something is , is defined with respect to this last sphere , the celestial sphere , outside of which is this eternal , perfect realm , where lives god , who is the ultimate judge of everything .
all properties of things are about these kinds of relationships .
if it wasn &apos;t for gravity , there wouldn &apos;t be life , because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time , keeping pieces of the world , like the surface of the earth , out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve .
as i realized , just like with many many things in my life that i actually love , i adapt to it .
the most beautiful landscapes i had seen in asia were sri lanka and bali .
and we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside , and make those compasses go crazy , always centering on them .
i &apos;ve found that finding out about what i &apos;m going to like in the future , my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it .
which i understood after i translated it from architecture speech in to regular english , basically as logo making .
on one hand i have nothing against selling .
and the amsterdam police in all their wisdom , came , saw , and they wanted to protect the artwork .
i think it &apos;s safe to say that all humans will be intimate with death at least once in their lives .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m saying .
so by having death as a part of the cultural and social fabric of life , people &apos;s everyday decisions about their health and healthcare are affected .
chris has been so nice .
thank you . bruno &apos;s face , just then , he said , &quot; no , don &apos;t go through this . don &apos;t , please don &apos;t .
and there he is .
&quot; i just think , you know , what people forget , gordon and i , we always got on perfectly well .
it &apos;s certainly something he can relate to .
i &apos;m right-handed but i seem to have smudged that ink as well . &quot;
it &apos;s rather like that line in the film &quot; as good as it gets . &quot;
&quot; ... who said , reach out and touch ... &quot;
all right .
by about 1970 , some scientists were sitting around and they thought , &quot; what in the world ?
and he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like , if it grew in sort of a linear fashion , it would have a crest about half the size of the adult .
so these are dinosaurs that are called pachycephalosaurs .
the dome , that little dome , is growing really fast .
and this is a skull that is two meters long .
so there &apos;s these two dinosaurs , t. rex and nanotyrannus .
from urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff .
it &apos;s formless , featureless , depthless , scaleless , massless , purposeless and dimensionless .
this was something done at the cartier foundation .
and so this was a three-month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element .
but culminating -- and that &apos;s where this hooks into the theme of my little talk -- is this mediatheque , which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building .
the clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall .
and this is a mockup that is in salt lake city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale .
they reported just 37 percent of stories in print , tv and radio .
the global media monitoring project has found that stories by female reporters are more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters .
putting them there made them more recognizable .
she was the cbs news correspondent who was brutally sexually assaulted in egypt &apos;s tahrir square right after this photo was taken .
the botanical names are in front of you .
and thank you for listening .
at the moment it &apos;s in indianapolis , but it was at the smithsonian .
i am sitting behind a sign that says &apos; the united states , &apos; and if i don &apos;t speak today then the voice of the united states will not be heard , &quot; and it was the first time that i had that feeling that i had to step out of myself in my normal , reluctant female mode and decide that i had to speak on behalf of our country .
but it was one of the first times that i didn &apos;t have to cook lunch myself .
for instance , she is now the president of finland , but tarja halonen was the foreign minister of finland and , at a certain stage , head of the european union .
thank you for joining us today .
so exit the rock star .
this is everything .
it &apos;s called inertia . it &apos;s how we screw it up .
once you have this knowledge , you can &apos;t un-know it .
we &apos;re going to win if we work together as one , because the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power .
you will ask someone on the street if they &apos;ve heard of microsoft .
so that was a normal working ship .
when are we going to start talking and thinking about shipping miles as well as air miles ?
they ask if it should have reproduction in it , or metabolism , or evolution .
there &apos;s the solar panels of the cell , some switches that turn your genes on and off , the girders of the cell , motors that move your muscles .
now , these are big questions in computer science .
each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place , and a right half that binds it in a different place , and brings the long strand together like this .
now , what &apos;s great about this is anybody can do this .
you have your molecular compiler , you can do whatever you want .
here &apos;s the dna origami , and what we can do is we can write 32 on both edges of the dna origami , and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles , and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square .
one , two , three , four , five , six , nine , 10 , 11 , 12 , 17 .
i &apos;ve explored , experienced , and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart &apos;s content .
and the demand side being mostly politicians , bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them .
i believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a bpo kind of environment , and made available on web , call-center and franchise physical offices , for a fee , to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe .
so we actually used the right to information act , which is equal to the freedom of information act in the united states , and pushed back the officers in this particular case .
this is a training ground .
virtue is an old-fashioned word .
real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing .
and the kid was drinking it , and a security guard spotted it , and called the police , who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark , whisked the kid to the hospital .
the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job .
and as a result , they lose their gifts , or worse , they stop playing altogether .
the truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough .
i don &apos;t know how many of you remember this : another moral hero , 15 years ago , aaron feuerstein , who was the head of malden mills in massachusetts -- they made polartec -- the factory burned down .
as practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary , if not extraordinary heroes .
he also appealed to hope .
they were quite proud of the fact that you know , before the dust clears , if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her , they will have brought him back , they will be getting world-class triage emergency care faster than you and i would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the united states .
seems like that would be an inconvenience .
and we took some pretty cruddy home movies .
when i told them that they weren &apos;t entirely enthusiastic , but i told them , &quot; it really doesn &apos;t matter what their opinion is .
and he said , &quot; you know , i &apos;m the lucky guy at this table .
he &apos;s got no legs .
i &apos;ll shut up , except one message or concern i have .
i &apos;ve never seen a bird flying around at mach 2 .
you know , rather than drive today , i &apos;m going to walk .
let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
in 1987 i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river .
there is a chemical that &apos;s called perflubron .
purging is basically hyperventilating .
i ate really small controlled portions throughout the day .
this was a different record . this was a pure o2 static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes .
i wanted to get them to do a piece on it .
i &apos;m going to fail , i &apos;m going to fail . &quot;
it would start . it would stop . and i felt all this .
david blaine : how i held my breath for 17 minutes
then connect the power . finally , the yellow ethernet cable .
so , as sort of — i &apos;m told it &apos;s called a stadium wave , so we &apos;re going to start from this side of the room on the count of three , and go over to here .
i &apos;m going to try to give you a view of the world as i see it , the problems and the opportunities that we face , and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic .
it will cause rising seas . it will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands .
most of them were about resources .
a minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas , coupled with increasing flows from the himalayas . and take a look at this .
we may see the eradication of guinea worm next year -- there are only 35,000 cases left in the world .
and you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air .
a disease which killed hundreds of thousands in india , and blinded half of all of those who were made blind in india , ended .
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them .
these are normal cells .
these are all the first cloned animals of their type .
and what they &apos;ve done here is they &apos;ve put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top , and it &apos;s on a big computer tracking ball .
there &apos;s also been work done with monkeys .
this is a mouse created by charles vacanti of the university of massachusetts .
we are not only already using these things in animals , some of them we &apos;re already beginning to use on our own bodies .
but much later , in 1871 , he did have something to say about it .
in those early days of our evolution , looking at the equator , we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation .
this had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation .
what they haven &apos;t been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas , or working inside all the time .
i think , were he able to look at the evidence we have today , he would understand it .
now this is the real . it &apos;s a cauliflower .
so then if you try to ask questions : &quot; what &apos;s the surface of a cauliflower ? &quot;
so what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung , but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale , for a man and for a little rodent .
it was very important , but mostly interesting because a kind of break , a separation between the mathematics coming from reality , on the one hand , and new mathematics coming from pure man &apos;s mind .
then i was telling my assistant , &quot; i don &apos;t see anything . can you paint it ? &quot;
so the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say ? -- model price variation .
and i went from what &apos;s called real numbers , which are points on a line , to imaginary , complex numbers , which are points on a plane , which is what one should do there , and this shape came out .
bottomless wonders spring from simple rules , which are repeated without end .
and i &apos;m going to share one of these studies with you today .
okay , that &apos;s cool .
it all has to do with when you face what i call the inca .
and therefore , there are times when you &apos;re facing the inca , when the feedback is going to be immediate , negative , concrete , and you have the sense of agency , where you &apos;re far better off taking the passenger &apos;s seat and have someone else drive .
that was a turning point for my life .
i think we &apos;re all in this room , probably , because we know that , in fact , africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years , where the food import bill is now double what it was 20 years ago , where food production per capita has stagnated , and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased .
that in turn , because of the weak marketing system , led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country .
in the american midwest , farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the chicago market .
that means that the exchange will operate a trading system , which will initially start as an open outcry , because we don &apos;t think the country &apos;s ready for full electronic trading .
we believe that the stakes are high , but that the returns will be even greater .
it is always the same , never the same , endlessly fascinating .
we get droughts , increased desertification , crashing food systems , water scarcity , famine , forced migration , political instability , warfare , crisis .
it provides a physical support structure for the trees , and it creates physical spaces , habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes .
the first is to create a kind of balloon structure , fill it with bacteria , then allow the sand to wash over the balloon , pop the balloon , as it were , disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it .
it &apos;s not only something that supports trees , but something that connects people and countries together .
i paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again .
if this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant .
he &apos;s barefoot . he &apos;ll run back into his house , and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet .
poop &apos;s not particularly adequate .
it &apos;s not just in the poor world that poop can save lives .
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india , and she was engaged at 14 , and then at 21 or so , she moved into her in-law &apos;s house .
but there are things to worry about .
and that was what i did .
and the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe , like a hurricane , it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery , but what &apos;s going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that .
and we trawl , which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds , put it on a big chain , and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish .
and when it dies , it falls to the bottom and then it rots , which means that bacteria break it down .
think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the northwest passage .
but what does that mean ?
this confused his colleagues , obviously , because they were sitting right there with him .
and if enrico fermi were indeed a space alien , wouldn &apos;t he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here ?
&quot; there &apos;s no such thing . &quot;
i was starting high school at the time . i would say she was a junior , but i had never seen her before . she didn &apos;t go to my school .
when i say it out loud , it sounds so ridiculous , but i can only come to the conclusion that it was what , in the alien abductee community , they call a &quot; screen memory &quot; : a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma -- say , of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid .
close encounter four : the algarve , portugal , 1991 .
now , i did not speak portuguese .
thank you for your kind attention .
how much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets ?
we love new stuff -- new material stuff for sure -- but also new ideas , new adventures , new experiences .
in the crisis , in the recession , what do people want to do ?
so who are we ?
so we can do that here -- we can just put in a little search term .
so let me come back , with this sense of hope , to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door .
can i picture politicians doing it ?
there &apos;s no photoshop here .
my early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn &apos;t expect to be used as canvas , like fried food .
this is a photograph from when i visited prudhoe bay in alaska in 2002 to watch the minerals management service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice .
the next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate , and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that , and shrimp .
this is bp &apos;s gas station in downtown los angeles .
but in many ways , that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us .
this is why these moments of these oil spills are so important .
and then the guy in the exxon uniform stepped out , and we realized it was okay .
we need to stay away from the moratoriums .
the first thing that you have on the tax is -- you have a tax for a stronger america -- 33 cents .
and a lot of men literally don &apos;t get beyond the first sentence as a result .
&quot; mary was beaten by john . &quot;
why is domestic violence still a big problem in the united states and all over the world ?
these are the kind of questions that we need to be asking and the kind of work that we need to be doing , but if we &apos;re endlessly focused on what women are doing and thinking in relationships or elsewhere , we &apos;re not going to get to that piece .
so we have it in our direct self-interest , not to mention the fact that most men that i know have women and girls that we care deeply about , in our families and our friendship circles and every other way .
and if we can get to the place where men who act out in sexist ways will lose status , young men and boys who act out in sexist and harassing ways towards girls and women , as well as towards other boys and men , will lose status as a result of it , guess what ?
if we can make this point that i &apos;m making to powerful men and women in our society at all levels of institutional authority and power , it &apos;s going to change , it &apos;s going to change the paradigm of people &apos;s thinking .
we that have a choice have an opportunity and a responsibility to them as well .
people become so engaged that they have volunteers , just like political volunteers anyway , who fan out over the countryside , campaigning for their candidate .
no small thing .
and i firmly believe that what we &apos;re seeing in the himalayas is the next great , big battleground on this earth .
i then began to choke , and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water .
and i stood there on the edge of the lake , and i looked up at mt . everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and i said to myself , just do this slowly .
so , this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we &apos;re going to make things in the future .
took me six years at mit , and about that many pages to describe what i was doing , and it took him one page . and so this is our muse tucker .
in a neutral state , they won &apos;t bind at all .
so , you know , it &apos;s a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently .
and as i rotate it against this side shot , you &apos;ll see that that has cylinder , and that was programmed in -- literally into the physics of the system .
they &apos;re starting to invest in materials science , but these are the new things in materials science .
we look at where the emissions are coming from -- they &apos;re coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth , and we say , okay , well the problem is that they &apos;re coming out of fossil fuels that we &apos;re burning , so therefore , the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy .
increasingly , we &apos;re realizing that we don &apos;t even need to densify an entire city .
what we &apos;re finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things .
water is energy intensive .
you can find four or five passages in the bible of this ilk .
and of course , our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior . one of the reasons violence went down is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time .
the logic of the golden rule -- the more you think about and interact with other people , the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your interests over theirs , at least not if you want them to listen to you . you can &apos;t say that my interests are special compared to yours , anymore than you can say that the particular spot that i &apos;m standing on is a unique part of the universe because i happen to be standing on it that very minute .
it &apos;s a hotel that &apos;s only open until midnight , so it &apos;s not a place that you stay .
amy lockwood : selling condoms in the congo
and we had one set of countries up there which was the western world .
and when i now finally got it right , i can go back 200 years in history .
whereas when my oldest son , who works for google , he should develop by quarter , or by half-year .
this is east asia , and the light blue there is south asia .
and i can split the others . here is the south asian , arab world .
and that doesn &apos;t come easy from the mouth of a swedish public health professor .
and they reduced child mortality , with an amazing 4.7 percent per year . they beat sweden .
these yellow are just about to be doing this .
if i split tanzania in its income , the richer 20 percent in tanzania has more hiv than the poorest one .
don &apos;t get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries .
if you &apos;re just talking about social structure , ok , clearly that &apos;s gotten more complex a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels .
point is : there &apos;s obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds .
and you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been , ok . this was not a prevalent view , few thousand years ago , and i attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic .
so , what do we do ? well , first of all , we can do a lot more with arms control , the international regulation of dangerous technologies .
i also like it because it &apos;s an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise .
it &apos;s going to be hard . i say we give it a shot anyway because we &apos;ve just come too far to screw it up now .
i want to say why psychology was good , why it was not good and how it may become , in the next 10 years , good enough .
we forgot about improving normal lives .
they don &apos;t spend time alone .
and , as i said , it &apos;s not particularly malleable .
you have intense concentration .
it &apos;s being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works .
so we ask -- and we &apos;ve done this in 15 replications involving thousands of people -- to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure , the pursuit of positive emotion , the pleasant life , the pursuit of engagement , time stopping for you , and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction ?
that is , it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness , to increase positive emotion , and that &apos;s typically how they &apos;ve been used .
by displaying despair , helplessness and hopelessness , the media is telling the truth about africa , and nothing but the truth .
and in the process , none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms , not the causes of africa &apos;s fundamental problems .
africa has received many opportunities .
talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them .
where has all the aid gone ?
so , the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers , the permanent secretaries , the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects , while the poor die without ambulances and medicine .
and this is a comet , captured by dr. euan mason .
the quality of these amateur photographs can , at times , be amazing .
nick , along with researcher dr. michael fay , collared the matriarch of the herd .
what jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places .
from here , the more severely wounded are transported back to germany , where they meet up with their families for the first time .
then paul thinks that she simply took pity on him .
my confession is this : i am a health psychologist , and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier .
it &apos;s called the social stress test .
before they went through the social stress test , they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful .
it fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
and listen up , because this study could also save a life .
one billion people in the world today do not have access to all-season roads .
we use three key technologies .
and i want to show you what one of those vehicles looks like up close .
half a billion of us live in megacities .
and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that , unlike aliens and dinosaurs , we look at human faces every day .
and these we &apos;re actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character .
image metrics is a markerless , performance-driven animation company .
around 17 to 20 years , i became , myself , a poacher .
and it has the ituri forest itself -- about 1,300 species of plants , so far known .
and when they came , they looted everything .
that mineral has killed a lot : five millions of congolese have gone because of this colombo-tantalite -- they call it coltan -- that they use it to make cell phones and it has been in that area , all over in congo . extraction , and good , big business of the war .
that is coltan extraction , gold mining .
sorry .
what we are doing after that -- that was the situation of the war -- we have to rebuild .
i don &apos;t think that someone may blame google , because it &apos;s doing the right things , even if people like al-qaeda are using google to connect between them .
botanist corneille ewango talks about his work at the okapi faunal reserve in the congo basin -- and his heroic work protecting it from poachers , miners and raging civil wars .
and eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don &apos;t do justice .
exploration is a physical process of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before .
i mean , i cut through three years of engineering meetings , design and system integration , and introduced depthx -- deep phreatic thermal explorer .
the government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024 .
so , what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price ?
it has never been done .
now we &apos;re at a time when boldness is required to move forward .
did you know that , in iraq and afghanistan , there were more private military contractors on the ground than there were u.s. military troops ?
let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
hm : to be frank , i just think this is , not to offend anyone , a very american way .
against the background of rising inequality , marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent and those who are of modest means increasingly live separate lives .
they &apos;re demographics , education , debt and inequality .
the vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today &apos;s prices .
all the rest went to the top one percent .
that comes out at five to 10 tons daily per square mile in cities .
you have to choose either option a or option b .
and some people would say that we &apos;re born with it in some other means .
there was a reason for everything .
there is also the uncertainty principle , which is part of quantum mechanics , as i understand it .
but , both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning , or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions .
it may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as i said , human rights in burma .
well , what is random ? what is chance ? what is luck ?
and how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a court of law ?
and i think it is by questioning , and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths .
but this guy named otto rohwedder invented sliced bread , and he focused , like most inventors did , on the patent part and the making part .
this picture is really fuzzy , i apologize ; i had a bad cold when i took it .
and my parable here is you &apos;re driving down the road and you see a cow , and you keep driving because you &apos;ve seen cows before .
but it &apos;s a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread , and which ones don &apos;t .
they have something i call &quot; otaku &quot; -- it &apos;s a great japanese word .
but hospitals are buying it faster than any other model .
that &apos;s risky . the safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes , be remarkable .
they don &apos;t anymore . so the founding fathers said , &quot; we &apos;ve got some money to spend .
no to violence : ramy essam came to tahrir on the second day of the revolution , and he sat there with this guitar , singing .
this was my mental model of the world : exploding population , small planet ; it &apos;s going to lead to ugly things .
fear for the future leads to some rash decisions .
and even though we see a lot of ice in this picture , there &apos;s a lot of water as well , which wasn &apos;t there historically .
this is the daily auction at the tsukiji fish market that i photographed a couple years ago .
so i went to the bahamas because there &apos;re very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days , but the bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy , largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago .
but , you know , here we see a shark that &apos;s maybe 10 or 11 inches long swimming in about a foot of water .
this photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of florida .
and one of the first places i worked was a reserve called goat island in leigh of new zealand .
and in between those slits were the saddest eyes i &apos;ve ever seen .
there &apos;s nothing left -- just a bit of grass there .
so we do the &quot; people , profit , planet &quot; principles , but we do it in addition to a sure legal status -- because if the forest belongs to the state , people say , &quot; it belongs to me , it belongs to everyone . &quot;
april .
so we bought that land , and here is where we started our project -- in the middle of nowhere .
and then slowly , the trees start taking over , bringing in produce from the fruits , from the timber , from the fuel wood .
and finally i made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain .
each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back .
usually i like working in my shop , but when it &apos;s raining and the driveway outside turns into a river , then i just love it .
a pair of helices and 40 wooden slats .
i like working with my hands .
so to start , i want to introduce some characters from a book i made for teenagers .
which is bogota , and they did a very good job .
and it &apos;s not shanghai , it &apos;s not being colored during the day , only at night it will look this way .
and since we have people from uzbekistan , kazakhstan , tajikistan , &#91; unclear &#93; , we have to stop the program .
well , it &apos;s a curiously neglected subject , both in our scientific and our philosophical culture .
and i used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache .
people always say consciousness is very hard to define .
it consciously seems like there &apos;s -- i like the french &quot; arc-en-ciel &quot; — it seems like there &apos;s an arch in the sky , or it seems like the sun is setting over the mountains .
one and the same event , my conscious decision to raise my arm has a level of description where it has all of these touchy-feely spiritual qualities .
well , some computations are intrinsic .
and the message i want to leave you with is , consciousness has to become accepted as a genuine biological phenomenon , as much subject to scientific analysis as any other phenomenon in biology , or , for that matter , the rest of science .
very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be , or if they have any to speak of .
what we need -- and the word &apos;s been used many times during the course of the past few days -- is not evolution , but a revolution in education .
now , doing this is easier said than done .
let me give you a couple of examples .
but it &apos;s what i wanted , and as soon as i left school , i applied to the fire service and i was accepted . &quot;
this is something jamie oliver talked about the other day .
we have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process ; it &apos;s an organic process .
in this poignant , funny follow-up to his fabled 2006 talk , sir ken robinson makes the case for a radical shift from standardized schools to personalized learning -- creating conditions where kids &apos; natural talents can flourish .
there &apos;s actually a well-known regularity to them where the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier is 10 times smaller .
when you &apos;re faced with brutality , whether it &apos;s a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence -- or , on the streets of syria today , facing tanks and shrapnel , what &apos;s the most effective thing to do ?
nelson mandela went to jail believing in violence , and 27 years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills , the incredible skills , that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy .
my fear grows fat on the energy i feed it .
in order to develop a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger .
the british military have always been much better at this .
i don &apos;t have to believe in it .
i think of this as the place of imagination , of potential , but what are its qualities ?
the elemental world that we all live in is that space that we all visited together , the darkness of the body .
the pieces appear and disappear , but maybe more importantly -- this is just looking north from the center of the installation -- they create a field , a field that involves living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation , a relation with each other and a relation with that limit , the edge , the horizon .
it &apos;s about reasserting our firsthand experience in present time .
asked later in the canadian documentary , &quot; the corporation , &quot; what i meant by the &quot; go to jail &quot; remark , i offered that theft is a crime .
we have measured our progress very rigorously .
a better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
but does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
and through his sobering point of view i saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
we now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time .
and indeed , do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine ?
and indeed , i think , rather than being annihilated , the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been .
and we talk about different ideas -- he had this idea that he thought music should be from the heart .
well , i &apos;m now a trustee of the university , and at my installation ceremony i said , &quot; i &apos;m the guy who came from the neighborhood who got into the place on probation .
so , from that fountain i built this building .
and he called me into his office -- which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of oz -- and john heinz had 600 million dollars , and at the time i had about 60 cents .
what we &apos;ve discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people is they don &apos;t have any money , which happens to be a curable condition .
well , i went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood , the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm , you can bring them right back to life .
he said , &quot; i &apos;ll get them to come to the school . &quot;
well , i &apos;m very pleased to announce to you that hp and a furniture company called steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all their furniture for the united states of america .
and like a fool , i didn &apos;t go to the ceremony because i didn &apos;t think we were going to win .
every building has a fountain .
and the reason this picture &apos;s in here is i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit , and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me .
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s very nice .
and i said , &quot; it came from your music , man .
bill strickland : rebuilding a neighborhood with beauty , dignity , hope
so , a solution to the problem , then , would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front-end circuitry and send signals to the retina &apos;s output cells , and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain .
so what about with our approach , adding the code ? and you can see that it &apos;s much better . not only can you tell that it &apos;s a baby &apos;s face , but you can tell that it &apos;s this baby &apos;s face , which is a really challenging task .
and of course it &apos;s the dna that counts , so here &apos;s all the a , t , gs and cs that make up your genetic code , and give you all your charming characteristics .
what we noticed is when the bacteria were alone , so when they were in dilute suspension , they made no light .
and so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep , it buries itself in the sand , and it &apos;s got a pump that &apos;s attached to its circadian rhythm , and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria .
so then we started to look at other bacteria , and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we &apos;ve discovered .
it &apos;s a very small , five-carbon molecule .
the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria .
again , we think that bacteria invented that , and you &apos;ve just evolved a few more bells and whistles , but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study .
lying just beneath the surface of those arguments , with passions raging on all sides , are big questions of moral philosophy , big questions of justice .
peter : the greatest benefit to all .
he asked the pga , the professional golfers &apos; association , for permission to use a golf cart in the pga tournaments .
what &apos;s your name ?
in the case , in the lower court , they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue .
so there you have justice scalia taking on the aristotelian premise of the majority &apos;s opinion .
so with flutes , with golf carts , and even with a fiercely contested question like same-sex marriage , aristotle has a point .
that &apos;s what i would love to do .
and here is that characteristic .
and that &apos;s true .
aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place , which is to say , metabolism .
and the reason it &apos;s the wrong answer is because of progress .
well , it seems to get the point across .
i say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this .
it does not intervene in this process or this one .
some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top .
audience : species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate .
there are species that have no aging -- hydra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells .
and although i want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that -- and also there &apos;s a factor of luck and timing -- we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values .
well i &apos;ll give you my straight talk about this .
we are not the same , and it &apos;s great . because of our differences , we create and sustain life .
and in fact , these are many of the half-vacant communities that you see today .
again , back in the &apos; 70s , a lot &apos;s changed since then , back in the &apos; 70s , one in 10 americans was obese .
you probably haven &apos;t thought that much about it .
if we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities , as they do in europe , we shall become as corrupt as they are in europe and take to eating one another as they do there . &quot;
all of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city .
jeff speck : the walkable city
it has a little cough and a hiccup , and out comes sprays of little frogs .
now by rights , this is kind of like a cloning project , like what produced dolly , but it &apos;s actually very different , because dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells .
the first one that we see occurs in the ancient rainforests of australia about 25 million years ago , and the national geographic society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits . this is riversleigh .
that guy is going to eat all our sheep .
every old curator who &apos;d been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen , put their hand in the jar , pulled it out and thought , &quot; wow , look at that , &quot; plop , dropped it back in the jar , contaminating this specimen .
and that tells us if we can get that genome back together , get it into a live cell , it &apos;s going to produce thylacine stuff .
and he told me , as it all was flooding back in memories .
and this is such a critical issue for us , because if we don &apos;t do that , we &apos;re going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice .
and in many other countries this is happening .
so now we have this platform we can build on .
from 1967 to &apos; 70 , nigeria fought a war -- the nigeria-biafra war .
almost a thousand people were there , trying to break down the door .
so that &apos;s one of the reasons , from a personal experience , that i say let &apos;s channel these resources we get into something productive .
and many of them are not really familiar with the continent .
and what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this .
in fact , the chinese minister of finance said to me , when i asked him what are we doing wrong in nigeria .
she needs another 20 million .
and i think that &apos;s a good question .
now i &apos;m going to review a study that i did , which was jazz in an fmri scanner .
these are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes when you &apos;re improvising versus when you &apos;re doing something memorized .
and then i &apos;m in the control room here , playing back and forth .
so how do you study rap scientifically ?
and what we see , we do see language areas lighting up , but then -- eyes closed -- when you are free-styling versus memorizing , you &apos;ve got major visual areas lighting up .
it &apos;s understanding data .
each individual &apos;s cortex is folded differently , very much like a fingerprint .
and the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain , because every brain is different .
and the great thing about it is that we &apos;ve only given the software one instance of how he thinks about &quot; disappear . &quot;
my company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas .
because if you open it up and reach inside , you &apos;d let the heat in , the game would be over .
now , malaria is an incredibly complicated disease .
this is our thousand-core supercomputer .
we also try to study our foe .
clinics are full of people that have malaria .
now , that &apos;s a fairly straightforward image processing routine , and let me show you how it works .
restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world .
this bench , although it was uncomfortable for my mom -- she didn &apos;t like sitting on it , so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale -- reusing , a job that was pretty good .
it serves 220 people a day .
but this is an electrical restaurant .
so basically , the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what i was doing anyway .
and i hope you all take part .
you see , i &apos;m a saudi woman who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars .
and to my surprise , it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day .
i was like , &quot; we are the last country in the world where women don &apos;t drive . &quot;
at the same time , i flew back to my home country , they hated that speech so much .
after being sent to jail or sentenced lashing , or sent to a trial , the spokesperson of the traffic police said , we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers .
basically i &apos;m recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chronologically compiling these one-second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until , you know , i can &apos;t record them anymore .
it helped me realize something else during this project , is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult .
and these are made of this kind of tube -- electricity tube , we call it in holland .
these are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way .
it &apos;s a binary step counter .
you can only do them one at a time .
carole lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another .
but it turned out it wasn &apos;t going to be as simple in the end , and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence .
and we added three quotations , because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work .
in the vaccine area , synthetic genomics and the institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven &apos;t been possible to date , things where the viruses rapidly evolve , such with rhinovirus .
my last book was about the story behind the shi &apos;a-sunni split , and for that i &apos;d worked closely with the earliest islamic histories , so i knew the events to which the koran constantly refers , its frame of reference .
and even then -- god is merciful ; forgiveness is supreme -- and so , essentially , better if you don &apos;t .
lesley hazleton sat down one day to read the koran . and what she found -- as a non-muslim , a self-identified &quot; tourist &quot; in the islamic holy book -- wasn &apos;t what she expected . with serious scholarship and warm humor , hazleton shares the grace , flexibility and mystery she found , in this myth-debunking talk . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
ants never make more ants ; colonies make more colonies .
so it starts out with zero ants , just the founding queen , and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five .
and finally , the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage .
and if you mark ants that are working outside , and dig up a colony , you never see them deep down .
and we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which .
and the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year .
and we &apos;ve just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads , and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .
something that they &apos;re doing is clearly successful enough that this pattern of haphazard contacts , in the aggregate , produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants .
and to be totally honest , that &apos;s hard for me to stand up here and say .
i feared my truth , i feared my honesty , i feared my vulnerability , and that fear made me feel like i was forced into a corner , like i was forced into a corner and there was only one way out , and so i thought about that way every single day .
we need to speak up and shatter the silence .
kevin breel didn &apos;t look like a depressed kid : team captain , at every party , funny and confident . but he tells the story of the night he realized that -- to save his own life -- he needed to say four simple words .
so , that &apos;s the step after this -- of computing as a raw material .
laser micro-machining : essentially 3d printers that digitally fabricate functional systems , all the way up to building buildings , not by having blueprints , but having the parts code for the structure of the building .
this is a device that lets you see your music .
there was a girl who insisted we stay late at night -- : kids : i love the fab lab .
it was very chaotic , it wasn &apos;t , sort of , clear what was going on .
and the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation and the fabrication divide : people locally developing solutions to local problems . thank you .
now if you look at the cost of opec , it cost seven trillion dollars -- on the milken institute study last year -- seven trillion dollars since 1976 , is what we paid for oil from opec .
so where do we go from here ?
and the opec nations are the ones that price the oil .
so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .
so from your point of view , you had this great pickens plan that was based on wind energy , and you abandoned it basically because the economics changed .
but i also am in the fueling business .
i can tell you it will be a failure .
i witnessed my first frack job at border texas in 1953 .
why are all the trash trucks today in southern california on natural gas ?
it &apos;s easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick .
they would take a ship down to panama , across the isthmus , and then take another ship north .
and you know , without the smell that would have accompanied that , we had the same thing on the internet : very bad burn rate calculations .
there &apos;s a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity .
there &apos;s asbestos under that handle there .
now , this was an object of much envy and lust .
i took this picture just two days ago .
my mom hates this picture .
in the beginning , there was compassion , and i mean not just when human beings first showed up , but actually even before that .
the bad news is this doesn &apos;t bring us universal compassion by itself .
it &apos;s not going to save the world .
the deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels .
so , there &apos;s plenty of non-zero-sumness .
i think it &apos;s worth the trouble because , again , it just helps us to understand .
and that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
well , she had a fantastic model for thinking .
so it &apos;s one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship .
in the end , joe and i found a way for him to raise his concerns .
welcome to 10,000 feet .
even the most durable and intactable buildings , like the pyramids of giza , are in bad shape when you look up close .
and thanks to jay walker who was here and mitch kapor who was here , who started the process , long now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land .
then there &apos;s the return .
here &apos;s danny hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on long now land . i should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered , led by a theory .
and alexander rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the national park to survey the whole mine . it &apos;s a mile deep .
another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain .
how about zander &apos;s crevice ? no .
you also see there a bighorn sheep .
and this stone takes a perfect polish .
you all remember , dolly , it came from a single mammary cell .
now look at that . there is that beautiful feather in the embryo .
in different contexts , cells do different things .
so , it &apos;s a new way of thinking about cancer , it &apos;s a hopeful way of thinking about cancer .
absolutely boggles my mind .
for decades , researcher mina bissell pursued a revolutionary idea -- that a cancer cell doesn &apos;t automatically become a tumor , but rather , depends on surrounding cells for cues on how to develop . she shares the two key experiments that proved the prevailing wisdom about cancer growth was wrong .
almost every aspect of human communication &apos;s been changed , and of course that &apos;s had an impact on deception .
my favorite , by nicodemus jones , is , &quot; whatever else it might do , it will touch your soul . &quot;
and what we found , to many people &apos;s surprise , was that those linkedin résumés were more honest on the things that mattered to employers , like your responsibilities or your skills at your previous job .
that really is strange . how do we explain this ?
anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
all right , so why do i care about this ?
thank you so much for your time , and good luck with your record .
because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life , how you want to connect to information .
but we &apos;ve come a long way .
and so i was following this guy .
and anyway , roll this little clip , i &apos;ll just show you .
: thank you . we can do anything you ask .
you don &apos;t master feeling lousy about one thing .
but i am really a little bored with everything .
im : just checking , because some people want to look , you know , aggressively ugly .
i &apos;ll tell you that i cook a lot also . i love to cook .
im : is that all it is ?
fashion designer isaac mizrahi spins through a dizzying array of inspirations -- from &apos; 50s pinups to a fleeting glimpse of a woman on the street who makes him shout &quot; stop the cab ! &quot; inside this rambling talk are real clues to living a happy , creative life .
and i was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders , and i witnessed the rise of islamist extremism as distinct from islam the faith , and the way in which it influenced my co-religionists across the world .
if you look at the rise of far-right fascism across europe of late , you will see some things that are happening that are influencing domestic politics , yet the phenomenon is transnational .
if i ask you to think of their narratives -- the west being at war with islam , the need to defend islam against the west -- these narratives , they come to your mind immediately .
to go around saying that i believe democratic culture is the best that we &apos;ve arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism .
mass movements in pakistan have been represented after the arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming for some form of theocracy , rather than for a democratic uprising .
and the aspiration that we have at the moment -- as young arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism -- is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that .
now that &apos;s a big claim . i &apos;m going to try to back it up .
and that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium .
for a while there the top 10 most clicked links on twitter , the global short messaging service -- nine of the top 10 links were about the quake .
but like the maginot line , the great firewall of china was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge , because not one of those four things was true in this environment .
it is the green lines now , that are the source of the free content , which brings me to my last story .
in a world where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap , in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants , in that world , media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals .
i remember one time being up near the summit , i reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle , inside my down jacket , only to discover that the water was already frozen solid .
this is me crossing a crevasse .
these are some climbers waiting to go to the summit .
this is on the way toward the summit , on that 1,500-foot bridge .
they tried to radio a message to rob hall , who was a superb climber stuck , sort of , with a weak climber up near the summit .
his wife was home in new zealand , seven months pregnant with their first child , and rob asked to be patched into her . that was done , and rob and his wife had their last conversation .
so , as i was taking care of beck , he related what had been going on up there .
this might be what beck would be experiencing when he realizes he &apos;s in danger .
he &apos;s beginning to focus , he can concentrate now .
ken kamler : medical miracle on everest
and i believe this change in the mindset , of looking at people as something of a burden to human capital , has been one of the fundamental changes in the indian mindset .
forty years back , computers were seen as something which was forbidding , something which was intimidating , something that reduced jobs .
for some reason , whatever reason -- lack of money , lack of priorities , because of religion having an older culture -- primary education was never given the focus it required .
and therefore you had a situation where every state had its own market for products .
but most important i believe are the ideas we need to anticipate .
and it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible , that you can have a democracy , that you can have an open society , and you can have growth .
and he knew me , so i was like , &quot; greg ? &quot;
sp : i &apos;m not the media , dammit !
sp : baril , don &apos;t look at it , bud .
and i want to say , i was nervous .
any one-four elements get to the gate !
twin suicide car bombings killed eight iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of baghdad .
so you get to experience that in real time , right ?
and usually , the first questions are , &quot; oh , what kind of cameras did you use ? &quot;
you can go for days here and not feel like there &apos;s a war going on .
basically you believe in complexity , but not in ambiguity .
and this is a major issue .
because first you have the 1960s and 1970s , cultural and social revolution , which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose .
and when you go to the brain sciences , what political consultants learned from the brain scientists is don &apos;t talk to me about ideas anymore , don &apos;t talk to me about policy programs .
for example , can you imagine that decent , civic , talented people are going to run for office if they really do believe that politics is also about managing mistrust ?
it &apos;s got to be worth something , right ?
now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction across all three cohorts , then the investors get a seven and a half percent annualized return on their investment , and if we do better than that , they can get up to 13 percent annualized return on their investment , which is okay .
so david cameron &apos;s put 20 million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea .
with this kind of model , we can help bring them together .
i go , &quot; you &apos;re the driver , you should know . &quot; he goes , &quot; no , i just arrived , sir . &quot;
i &apos;m going to be all right . &quot;
even if i &apos;m there with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; greetings , jack . salutations , jack . &quot;
if you guys haven &apos;t figured it out already , my name &apos;s tom thum , and i &apos;m a beatboxer , which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice , and the only thing was my voice .
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;d like to introduce you to a very special friend of mine , one of the greatest double bassists i know .
we did the line install over the summer .
so what will you do ? i &apos;ll tell you what i did and why i did it . and i know my time &apos;s up .
so the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom .
so this is how it looks , you know , the operating room of the future today .
it &apos;s a target in the thalamus .
this is the outcome from a patient perspective -- same day after the treatment .
all those i &apos;ve indicated have already been shown to be successfully treated by focused ultrasound relieving the pain , again , very fast .
and it has been shown actually outside of the u.s .
so she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in 2008 .
they have trademark protection , but no copyright protection and no patent protection to speak of .
can &apos;t copyright a costume either .
and , you know , a knock-off is never the same as an original high-end design , at least in terms of the materials ; they &apos;re always made of cheaper materials .
he wanted to make it too difficult to copy , and that &apos;s what fashion designers are doing all the time .
a person can come in and take somebody else &apos;s gown , cut off three inches from the bottom , go to the e.u. and register it as a new , original design .
jokes , no copyright protection .
it &apos;s a digital file .
the tree was in part a catalyst for the project .
so with the help of some biologists studying the fungus , i got some maps and some gps coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings , the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees .
as it &apos;s gotten warmer on the top of the mountain , the vegetation zone is actually changing .
and this can create great natural shelters for animals , but they &apos;ve also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses , including a bar , a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree .
this is the clonal mojave yucca , it &apos;s about a mile away , and it &apos;s a little bit older than 12,000 years .
rachel sussman shows photographs of the world &apos;s oldest continuously living organisms -- from 2,000-year-old brain coral off tobago &apos;s coast to an &quot; underground forest &quot; in south africa that has lived since before the dawn of agriculture .
now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed .
and ultimately , some physicians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
so going the hospital is a lottery .
but if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
if a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
and we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
twenty years later , criminals are still using mobile phones , but they &apos;re also building their own mobile phone networks , like this one , which has been deployed in all 31 states of mexico by the narcos .
the innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government .
this is what radicals can do with openness .
but they &apos;re adapting quickly .
that &apos;s troubling , since the human body itself is now becoming an information technology .
it already has a 70 percent mortality rate if you get it , but it &apos;s hard to get .
what happens if we were to take the president &apos;s dna , or a king or queen &apos;s , and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that dna and do penetration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders ?
after all , public safety is too important to leave to the professionals .
but the real question is , what is the cost of not daring ?
because they &apos;re focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future .
alex , in some ways , said it best .
but less than 24 hours , i was 13 miles away from those mosques , visiting one of our acumen investees , an incredible man , jawad aslam , who dares to live a life of immersion .
and he said that every day this six-year-old , dressed in her beautiful dress , would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily , calling her a monster , threatening to poison her -- distorted faces .
so may each of you live lives of immersion .
well , for that they have to be done as we just saw , en face or three-quarters .
what was the age of leonardo at the time ? does that fit ?
if we were to assay her perceptual abilities , they would be crude .
that &apos;s all another way of saying that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments .
i can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan , in the presence of continuous noise .
the monkey actually mastered the task in about 700 practice tries .
now actually we &apos;ve looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task .
and that &apos;s because the brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time .
most of them would be intellectual and academic failures .
and you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants .
this is a substantially large impact .
my main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies .
then i immediately asked her , why are you &#91; using &#93; that unhygienic method ?
so one day she said , openly , i &apos;m not going to support this research .
so after that , what i did , usually if anyone got a patent or an invention , immediately you want to make , convert into this .
already 600 installations . what is my mission ?
he had been there and watched it go off .
and the message was very clear : climate change is for real , and we need to do something about it .
and on day four , we decided to just do a quick five minute test swim .
he accidentally fell through the ice into the sea .
i had never seen black water before .
lp : thank you very much . thank you very much .
the talk will be broadly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start .
this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems .
what &apos;s different is how the molecules are put together .
it &apos;s ideas , it &apos;s innovation , it &apos;s technology that will end the age of oil , long before we run out of oil .
it &apos;s amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out .
and i thought it was worth a chance , he thought it was worth a chance , and so we got up on the stage , and we had an hour conversation about his life , and after that a woman rushed up to me , essentially did , and she said , &quot; where did you train as a doctor ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; i &apos;m his old girlfriend , maureen stapleton , and i could never do it . &quot;
she did so much . she was a playwright .
it was for a charity in connecticut when i was a congresswoman , and i got up there , &quot; and she went on and on , &quot; and then i got on the stage . &quot;
was yours unhappy ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; now , john adams was too honest . &quot;
she was , of course , done up for the occasion , but this was a woman in great physical distress .
you see it and you go , &quot; oh , my god . i &apos;d buy that in a second ! &quot;
here &apos;s the bad news : the only baby ever actually put inside the neonurture incubator was this kid during a time magazine photo shoot .
okay , that was an important lesson .
so these dark blue squares show you where it &apos;s effective phototherapy .
they want buck rogers , they don &apos;t want effective .
you think it &apos;s funny .
timothy prestero thought he &apos;d designed the perfect incubator for newborns in the developing world -- but his team learned a hard lesson when it failed to go into production . a manifesto on the importance of designing for real-world use , rather than accolades .
they were the actors of this global market , which i mentioned in the beginning .
we had this small ngo , transparency international .
this case , they are not prosecuting in the uk .
but what i &apos;m saying from my very practical experience : if civil society does it right and joins the other actors -- in particular , governments , governments and their international institutions , but also large international actors , in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility -- then in this magical triangle between civil society , government and private sector , there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world .
and there &apos;s two things i do : when i go into a gallery , first of all , i go quite fast , and i look at everything , and i pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other .
in fact , we don &apos;t know who any of the models in any of vermeer &apos;s paintings are , and we know very little about vermeer himself .
and he decides to paint her .
the light comes in from the left , his face is bathed in this glowing light . it &apos;s right in the center of the painting , and you look at it , and i found that when i was looking at it , i was standing there going , &quot; look at me . please look at me . &quot;
what is he thinking about that &apos;s making him blush ?
he managed to make the word tender .
i have a story , a story that i would like to share with you .
it seemed that for our neighbors and friends , africa was either this exotic place , this imaginary land that probably exists only in their imagination , or the place of horror , famine .
and you shoot in seven days .
but we can do something too .
but here , we improvise these items , like the gunshots .
a woman told me , &quot; when i see a nollywood film , i can relax , i really -- i can breathe better . &quot;
i would like you to hear their voices .
fs : oh yes , of course . this is very important .
or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time and that become part of our identity .
last week , guardian art critic blah blah suggested that games cannot qualify as art . but is he right ?
and the same with , for instance , tetris , original version , the soviet one .
i &apos;m sure that all of you know katamari damacy .
but here , in this particular case , we decided , you know , with kate and paul , that we would have no gratuitous violence .
so the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor &apos;s limitedness , which is fantastic . so aesthetics is always important .
i would like to acquire it , but without owning it .
in fact , it appeared in a porno comic book , which is the slide on the right .
the piece on the left -- and that ultimately led to the piece on the right -- happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket .
and i put them together , and you walk between them .
and so i set up this interior for jay &apos;s offices and i made a pedestal for a sculpture .
and so i did a lot of dirty things with chain link , which nobody will forgive me for .
i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture .
and we did it over the phone and by fax .
and then more metal and some chain link in santa monica -- a little shopping center .
he didn &apos;t recommend me , by the way .
the health club is fastened to the garage with a c-clamp , for cleveland .
and then up above there &apos;s a garden on this side of the living room , and one on the other side .
you go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour , and there &apos;s another bridge here .
and the one on the left is pretty awful .
so far .
it &apos;s a complicated project .
and the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural .
originally , this was all solid with a hole in it .
how is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year ?
and in fact if you look closely , right here , you can see it says , &quot; u.s. peace corps . &quot;
and more than in haiti , this produces really smoky fires , and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel .
and he &apos;s looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal .
i mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat .
we &apos;re also looking at low-cost water treatment systems .
and then we have the sensual factor of the face .
actually , sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed .
teachers and peers were underestimating her ; she was teased at school .
he ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it .
she was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality .
and so they want to see live witnesses .
we put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position .
i can sprinkle a few cells , stem cells from the patient &apos;s own hip , a little bit of genetically engineered protein , and lo and behold , leave it for four months and the face is grown .
and that if we don &apos;t do that , the antithesis , although we &apos;ve heard otherwise , is we &apos;re really going to become extinct , because we &apos;re feeding our children to death .
seventy percent -- it &apos;s unbelievable .
it is about what we feed them .
why can we have 29-cent big gulps and 99-cent double burgers ?
in fact , this may be what a lot of parents serve , as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve .
this is what we &apos;re serving this week at the schools .
you know , the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important , we have to teach kids about in school .
i had 90 employees .
that 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that &apos;s what the government allocates for lunch .
when i go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around , they ask me what field i &apos;m in and i say , &quot; philosophy &quot; -- their eyes glaze over .
i want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds -- that you are , yourselves , authoritative about your own consciousness .
now , that &apos;s the way a lot of people feel about consciousness .
he marvels at how he &apos;ll do a magic show , and afterwards people will swear they saw him do x , y , and z. he never did those things .
and i love paintings like that -- the painting is actually about as big as it is right here .
how many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind &apos;s eye , to see if it matched up with the one on the right ?
if you &apos;re seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles , some black circles , there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
show the next picture for 240 milliseconds . blank .
thanks very much for your attention .
now , planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do , and let me tell you a story .
but fortunately , it also works the other way around .
no , on the contrary , they changed , up to a point where we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges , meaning that -- i mean , let me repeat that : 70 percent of the population in stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free .
my travels to afghanistan began many , many years ago on the eastern border of my country , my homeland , poland .
these are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for afghan businessmen .
this is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care , in fixing health care .
obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then .
she &apos;s a veterinarian , so she &apos;s seen lots of ultrasounds .
and what i found was on other websites , even by the third page of google results , &quot; outlook is bleak &quot; , &quot; prognosis is grim . &quot;
very quickly they told me , &quot; kidney cancer is an uncommon disease .
and look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between .
well thank you . that shot the timing .
well that &apos;s not what he was supposed to do with it .
and i &apos;m about to show you some stop-motion footage that i made recently where you &apos;ll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour .
the world needs clean water , and more and more , we &apos;re pulling it from the oceans , desalinating it , and drinking it . but what to do with the salty brine left behind ? in this intriguing short talk , fellow damian palin proposes an idea : mine it for other minerals we need , with the help of some collaborative metal-munching bacteria .
we &apos;re a visual species . when scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night , we didn &apos;t believe it .
and what i want to do tonight is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat , and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings .
and one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases , or does this variation just make you different ?
but we are going to have to understand it a bit better .
and the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit if we just look in the right place . they &apos;re good for our ecosystem , they allow us to understand how our genome functions , and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth .
it wasn &apos;t just compassion for europe , though there was that .
we need to be at least as serious as we were then .
come back 15 years later .
democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies .
and the british treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third-generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth .
please , become ambassadors .
we do about five million of these in the united states and maybe 20 million of these worldwide .
we can &apos;t travel everywhere .
one of the things that i want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world .
it starts with a framework system where when the surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology , we then add another technology to do video conferencing .
now go ahead and cut .
so i tried bronze casting .
i couldn &apos;t build this the way i knew because hand-tied knots weren &apos;t going to withstand a hurricane .
so i replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
and after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes , it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed .
you can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .
but if you &apos;re still in pain in six months &apos; or six years &apos; time , it &apos;s because these circuits are producing pain that &apos;s no longer helping you .
it &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? probably not .
the locations of these enlightened districts , i think , will fail to surprise you .
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
for instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
the other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
sh : well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
just open it .
when temperature rises sharply , you can see those bad ones , those aphids , all over the plants , in your hibiscus , in your lantana , in the young , fresh foliage of the spring flush , so-called .
this is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside , in fact , a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out .
but again , the question is , here you saw them on a one-to-one basis -- the pest , the natural enemy .
in this table , you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs .
secondly , to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce .
and technology was going to carry us along .
this is tank polo in the south hamptons .
i did that as a quick back page -- i had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the lampoon , and i did that , and i thought , &quot; well , i &apos;m ashamed . i hope nobody knows it . &quot;
truth about that one is i had a horrible red wine hangover , in the middle of the night , this came to me like a xerox -- all i had to do was write it down .
i met jim and shirley in their 80s .
a lot of people say , &quot; if i get like that , just shoot me . &quot;
so , this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial .
and then finally , the fifth item on my checklist is the political , economic , social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems . in the case of the greenland norse , cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were : their commitments to a christian society investing heavily in cathedrals ; their being a competitive-ranked chiefly society ; and their scorn for the inuit , from whom they refused to learn . so that &apos;s how the five-part framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the greenland norse .
didn &apos;t they see what they were doing ? how could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time ?
why do societies fail ? with lessons from the norse of iron age greenland , deforested easter island and present-day montana , jared diamond talks about the signs that collapse is near , and how -- if we see it in time -- we can prevent it .
they remove dung , they pollinate our crops .
if they don &apos;t have any damage , they go to the grocery .
our diet consists , &#91; in &#93; some part , of animal proteins , and at the moment , most of us here get it from livestock , from fish , from game .
and there &apos;s the conversion factor .
even if you don &apos;t like it , you &apos;ll have to get used to this because at the moment , 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock .
if we die out , the insects will continue very happily .
marcel dicke : why not eat insects ?
that is what free gets you .
and i saw a sign .
when allison hunt found out that she needed a new hip -- and that canada &apos;s national health care system would require her to spend nearly 2 years on a waiting list -- she took matters into her own hands .
the idea is actually relatively simple .
for my thesis i actually built one of these out of paper .
but there is a difference between the two , because with your ipod you can tell -- or your iphone , you can tell exactly what the time is , with precision .
so , the earliest retes , for example , were very simple and primitive .
it &apos;s a robot that has three legs , which is inspired by nature .
the one in front , the smaller , is strider ii .
it affects the diameter and then can turn to the left , turn to the right .
now , we don &apos;t have enough time to go into technical details , i &apos;ll just show you some of the experiments .
so , for example in iraq , you know , the war zone , there is roadside bombs . currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed .
and the goal of robocup , the actual goal is , by the year 2050 we want to have full size , autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human world cup champions and win .
we also have the world &apos;s very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind .
nobody criticizes any opinion .
that &apos;s really the secret of our success , we &apos;re having too much fun .
only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the u.s. right now benefits rural communities , and yet 20 percent of our population lives there .
he was brought in in october 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system .
but beyond that , we recognized that bertie county , as a community , was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking .
so this is mr. perry . he &apos;s the assistant superintendent .
and in recent decades , a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely .
so this building downtown , which may very well become the site of our future farmers &apos; market , is now the classroom .
but i have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine .
well , i have news for you .
now , by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world &apos;s land , you are changing macroclimate .
so let &apos;s do that .
but before we began , our land looked like that .
thank you . i have , and i &apos;m sure everyone here has , a ) a hundred questions , b ) wants to hug you .
so that &apos;s the personal reason .
( text : such examinations allow us to improve eye-health in many children , and ...
and we try to do this for as long as possible .
it &apos;s a profound question , and what &apos;s even more amazing is how simple the answer is .
but for a long time we couldn &apos;t quite figure out : wow can we get these kinds of video inputs ?
instead of anticipating , the child always follows where the ball has been .
i played softball for five years growing up .
&quot; can i just sit in and see what you do ? &quot;
like , i almost came out of it , in front of , like , 5,000 people .
so , it &apos;s funny -- i &apos;m three inches within the world record -- and kept on from that point , you know , so i &apos;m signed up in the long jump -- signed up ?
and , you know , i &apos;m just thinking , &quot; oh , my god , my whole family got in a van and drove down here from pennsylvania . &quot;
am : well , these are my pretty legs .
i may be a little taller . i actually can put both of them on .
it &apos;s like a barbie foot under this .
i want to get legs like these made for flat feet so i can wear sneakers , because i can &apos;t with these ones .
we can really go for it .
don &apos;t start wrestling yet .
you &apos;ve been sitting for awhile , so the physical relief , getting to shake it out .
win one thumb once , you will become a grandmaster .
... if we use pennies .
hollywood and congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law .
so to explain that , let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education .
so the next thing is take that problem and turn it from a real world problem into a math problem .
it &apos;s a means to an end , not an end in itself , and automation allows us to have that machinery .
well one of them is , they say , you need to get the basics first .
i don &apos;t think so .
but there &apos;s a fantastic way to do that in the modern world .
we were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number .
we &apos;re trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real-world math .
it sounded familiar , and i quickly considered another possibility , and i reached out with my left hand , as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy , and i came across an ear , the ear of a dog , perhaps a golden retriever .
from that came a lot of insights , or outsights , as i called them , things that i learned since losing my sight .
but it &apos;s all good in the grand scheme of things .
so my final takeaway for you is that not only is the city good for the blind , but the city needs us .
so , they answered my emails .
but i &apos;ve become increasingly interested in religion .
the bible says that if two men are in a fight , and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man , then her hand shall be cut off .
and this man came up to me and he said , &quot; why are you dressed like that ? &quot;
so , you know , i met with creationists .
thou shall not stereotype .
you blow out candles on top of a birthday cake .
we &apos;re 25 , 26 years after the advent of the macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface and in computation in general .
it &apos;s a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well .
and finally , to pull out all the stops , this is a system called urp , for urban planners , in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use cad systems .
and , using a hand , we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom , six degrees of navigational control .
there &apos;re a lot of elements .
all right .
when real ? when for us , not just in a lab and on a stage ?
ju : it &apos;s been a great pleasure .
this went from a single idea and a single implementation in east africa in the beginning of 2008 to a global deployment in less than three years .
this is one of the participatory -- one of the participatory models we see coming out of that , along with ushahidi .
so gneezy and rustichini said , &quot; how many instances of late pick-ups are there at these 10 daycare centers ? &quot;
this brings me back to the lolcats and to ushahidi .
but we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value .
and then you worked out your strategy , and you came and fought the next day , and you went back home again .
television started covering cricket . for a long time television said , &quot; we won &apos;t cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it . &quot;
and thankfully for all of us , the english are very good at inventing things , and then the gracious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it .
they were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn &apos;t actually love it ; these were people who ran serious companies .
they started going to the cricket to watch shah rukh khan .
hb : suddenly , a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day -- so 250 rupees for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
there &apos;s no filth , there &apos;s no beggars , all the snake charmers have vanished , everybody &apos;s gone . this tells you how the capitalist world rules .
you all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads .
when was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was , &quot; boy dies of asthma ? &quot;
leroy has nine tickets ; there &apos;s one left .
assuming you wanted to go to hawaii , would you buy this package ?
the difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself , i &apos;m not paying twice for the same thing .
in fact , these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they &apos;re going to enjoy the potato chips .
i mean , compared to all these people who hate me when i try to speak their language and hate me more when i don &apos;t , these people are just wonderful . &quot; and so you tour france with them , and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner , and what do you find ?
imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that &apos;s 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months .
watch what happens when we drop some out .
we already know , for example , in the united states , more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes -- because they were scared -- and driving on highways , than were killed in 9 / 11 . ok ?
i don &apos;t want to say -- please , i &apos;m going to get quoted somewhere as saying , &quot; terrorism is fine and we shouldn &apos;t be so distressed . &quot;
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to , but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it .
adg : in persuading them .
he apparently lost an eye in battle , which is why he is always shown in profile .
so i took another crack at it -- you &apos;ve got to keep it moving -- and i xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and i pasted them down on an ugly board .
silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .
that can be a big contribution .
i &apos;m also convinced that , in an age of computer manipulation , surrealism has become banal , a shadow of its former self .
why this might be the case ?
one of the features , though , of disgust , is not just its universality and its strength , but the way that it works through association .
when you bring people into the laboratory and you ask them if they &apos;re willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors like eating chocolate that &apos;s been baked to look like dog poop , or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross , your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not you &apos;ll be willing to engage in those behaviors .
in particular , when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices , just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong .
i feel like i &apos;m coming home to talk about what i &apos;ve been away doing for 20 years .
marcus : because i do what i like ?
épuise , right ?
which takes us to the next piece , where the young man talks about lack of opportunity : living as a black person in europe , the glass ceiling that we all know about , that we all talk about , and his reality .
amphetamines .
he &apos;s not taking care of his troops .
you too are a retired general , not so ?
i met psychiatrists who spent time with them , aid workers , ngos , the whole lot .
zoom into it and see where it was taken .
mm : yeah , we &apos;re building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content .
you kept moving ahead in a life where you &apos;re dependent on working for somebody .
so , i thought , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s probably a good idea . &quot;
so , i think he &apos;s icarus and phoenix all in one guy .
alvaro siza grew up and lived in portugal and is probably considered the portuguese main guy in architecture .
fg : no , it &apos;s near the current campus .
you &apos;re not going to defy gravity .
but my point is that ... and i call it the &quot; then what ? &quot;
each one was more beautiful than the other .
i &apos;m going to make it for you !
and what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ?
people , for as little as a dollar a day , pick through our stuff .
the traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .
this goes into the more sophisticated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi-step separation process begins .
inspired by nature -- that &apos;s the theme here .
so in that respect , to me , i &apos;m not against the corporation .
but in the meantime , these things are scaling up .
and what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir , and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships .
here is a sign that , translated , says , &quot; obey the birth control law .
and so they &apos;re holding off until they get a deal with them .
right now that &apos;s all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago -- and high-rises are now going up into that central spot .
it wasn &apos;t too bad , but they &apos;re driven to produce these things at an incredible rate .
there &apos;s 21,000 employees . this one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long .
so part of my thinking , and part of my wishes , is sitting with these thoughts in mind , and thinking about , &quot; how is their life going to be when they want to have children , or when they &apos;re ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever , 15 years from now ? &quot;
wish two is more of the bottom-up , ground-up one that i &apos;m trying to work with .
and i think there &apos;s a real possibility to reach new audiences if i had a chance .
and so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature .
these guys are new world primates , which means they broke off from the human branch about 35 million years ago .
but this is the unit of currency that we &apos;ve taught our monkeys at yale to actually use with humans , to actually buy different pieces of food .
do the monkeys do anything like this ?
so much so that , if you saw the monkeys &apos; numbers , you couldn &apos;t tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market .
so see what your intuition is here .
this is all well and good , except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not .
for a big bonus , now they get three .
but they also do some of the irrational things we do .
my guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions .
these are my buildings .
but the challenge is , as we move to cities , cities are built in these two materials , steel and concrete , and they &apos;re great materials .
the way i describe this best , i &apos;ve found , is to say that we &apos;re all used to two-by-four construction when we think about wood .
we &apos;ve calculated a 20-story building : we &apos;ll grow enough wood in north america every 13 minutes .
and i believe the race is ultimately on .
and so , i came to think that mama eternal , mama eternal , is always wondering : are all the children in ?
a harvested field of grain , with some grain in the corners , reminding me of the hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest , but you must always leave some on the edges , just in case there &apos;s someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture .
we are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself .
i think maybe it &apos;s one time when the bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all god &apos;s children would have their needs cared for , so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks , &quot; in regards to health , are all the children in ? &quot; and we could say yes .
so when the white house was built in the early 19th century , it was an open house .
but we &apos;ve centralized these bureaucracies .
powerful , practical , palpable model for handing power from government to citizens .
last year they saved a billion dollars , 30 billion rubles , from open innovation , and they &apos;re pushing radically the extension of crowdsourcing , not only from banking , but into the public sector .
there are many things that we can do to get us there .
now we &apos;re moving onto washington , d.c .
but beyond exhibiting contemporary art , the hirshhorn will become a public forum , a place of discourse for issues around arts , culture , politics and policy .
the hirshhorn sits among the mall &apos;s momumental institutions .
i blush whenever i show this .
it &apos;s hoisted .
thank you .
seeing people die every day , my mother crying , it &apos;s like i was raised in a violence .
voices in my brain , of friends that was slain .
no sit or stop , as i reach for the top i &apos;m fully dedicated like a patriotic cop .
so one thing i know about music : music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system , your mind , your heart , influence your soul and your spirit , and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing .
i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month , but i &apos;ve been humbled .
but if you invest in education then we &apos;ll be able to change africa .
go save a life of a child .
the third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding .
it means that it &apos;s in the low 60 percent .
the way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger .
there are other states that do that , but we don &apos;t .
and he was talking first about his dad , who he hardly knew , who had died , and then about his mom , who he did know , who is still alive .
and my dad said , &quot; well , we believe in the catholic church that god knows that little kids don &apos;t know the difference between right and wrong , but when you &apos;re seven , you &apos;re old enough to know better .
it was too late for me , but maybe i could help someone else , someone who could use the information .
it wasn &apos;t until years later , looking back on this whole age-of-reason / change-of-birthday thing , that it dawned on me : i wasn &apos;t turning seven when i thought i turned seven . i had a whole other month to do anything i wanted to before god started keeping tabs on me .
i said , &quot; america ? from jerusalem to america by boat in 600 bc ? &quot;
i said , &quot; oh , come on . i mean , even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45 , assuming they didn &apos;t die from exhaustion , it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god . &quot; and they said , &quot; no . &quot;
and i have a dream .
but we &apos;ve created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff .
and we created , at the organization that i work for , the new economics foundation , something we call the happy planet index , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy .
conversely , at the bottom left of the graph , are countries that are not producing much well-being -- typically , sub-saharan africa .
and they invested in social programs -- health and education .
and the point is , we need to carry on increasing well-being .
in the u.k. , we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing .
our generosity , our altruism , our compassion , are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain .
there was a very important study done a while ago at princeton theological seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help , we do sometimes , and we don &apos;t other times .
i was at a sushi restaurant a while back and i overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman , who was in the singles scene . and this woman says , &quot; my brother is having trouble getting dates , so he &apos;s trying speed dating . &quot; i don &apos;t know if you know speed dating ?
these were very intimate murders -- he strangled his victims .
and the question is : will it make a difference ?
you arrive in a new city , and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place .
what &apos;s more , we abstract , repeat patterns , and recognize them .
but when you explore a foreign and new public transport system , you will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way .
now we could take out all the local buses that ran alongside those rapid transport means .
but nothing , nothing prepared me for what i was to hear on the first of july 2008 .
but it wasn &apos;t easy .
what i had done is i had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance .
i wrote the code and put it out there .
so yeah , it was difficult to explain , but there was a grassroots movement .
because data you can &apos;t naturally use by itself but in fact , data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it .
the idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that hans had , and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting .
not just for transparency , yeah transparency in government is important , but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in america .
here we are at ted , and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now -- curing cancer , understanding the brain for alzheimer &apos;s , understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable , understanding how the world works .
we need to do that with linked data .
tim berners-lee : the next web
but the key thing here is , what do you think should be in the new goals ?
often , they &apos;re not in the right place .
jamie drummond : fewer children every day .
rb : well , the nice thing about ted is everybody &apos;s interesting .
why did you do that ?
but about three months after the launch of the condom company , i had a letter , a complaint , and i sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely .
i mean , it is a tough job .
rb : philippe has done the -- yeah , quite a bit of it : the logos and he &apos;s building the space station in new mexico .
and you inspired an ian mcewan novel i think with that .
didn &apos;t -- weren &apos;t you just terrible at school ?
so she did things to us , which now she &apos;d be arrested for , such as pushing us out of the car , and telling us to find our own way to granny &apos;s , about five miles before we actually got there .
it &apos;s actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century . &quot;
and so we spend a very good sort of three months away together .
i mean , thabo mbeki &apos;s had his problems with accepting hiv and aids are related , but this is a way , i think , of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him , it &apos;s a way of working with him , with his government .
well , richard , when i was starting off in business , i knew nothing about it and i also was sort of -- i thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding .
he just started asking , &quot; where did you buy the radio ? how much is it ? &quot;
so this is what i was talking about , while molding , it &apos;s such a great experience , because we have freedom of like walking , or moving my hand or , moving around in the space , but the moment this becomes solid , when you cannot move even an inch , because this is plaster of paris , so the moment you pour it it &apos;s like liquid ; but after 20 minutes , it &apos;s almost like a hard stone .
he would definitely say , &quot; god came down from heaven , and he said unto the cow , &apos; thou shalt cross the road . &apos; and cow crossed the road , and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow . &quot;
it &apos;s about six inches deep in the wall , but it just appears like it &apos;s coming out of the wall .
this is the craft that was going on , but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate .
through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood , the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one .
i thought , &quot; oh , good . work is finished . &quot;
the other thing i would add is that this is not a new view .
so nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is , so i thought i would ask the person who &apos;s spearheading the effort to generate data on this , pascal lamy , the director of the world trade organization , what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of gdp , without the double- and triple-counting , and it &apos;s actually probably a bit under 20 percent , rather than the 30 percent-plus numbers that we &apos;re talking about .
and as i was laughing , i was thinking , i really need a more coherent response , especially on national tv . i &apos;d better write something about this .
so i actually spend most of my &quot; world 3.0 &quot; book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate .
and the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
but if we rearrange this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equals force over mass , which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction .
the marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anticipate they &apos;ll do .
your brand starts being dispersed , it gets more chaotic .
it activates what &apos;s called the buzzing bridge , or the dog .
so , for example , you can be a pitcher or a catcher , and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act .
can you imagine saying to your coach , &quot; uh , i &apos;m not really feeling it today , i think i &apos;ll sit this game out . &quot;
&quot; well , maybe we can go half and half . &quot;
and sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days .
i think our ancestors -- i think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago .
as one businessman in new york said to me , he said , &quot; anything she liked , i liked . &quot;
so we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state .
it can be focused on nobody .
and it &apos;s going to have an impact .
they &apos;ve got incredible people skills , negotiating skills .
and , indeed , once again we &apos;re moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of africa a million years ago , because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today .
that &apos;s why casual sex isn &apos;t so casual .
but more and more people in the united states are taking them long term .
mystery is important . you fall in love with somebody who &apos;s somewhat mysterious , in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain , probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love .
anthropologist helen fisher takes on a tricky topic – love – and explains its evolution , its biochemical foundations and its social importance . she closes with a warning about the potential disaster inherent in antidepressant abuse .
so when i was born , i guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me .
and in time , my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today .
in the decades to come , 75 percent of the world &apos;s population will live in cities , and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more .
now if you look at hong kong , they have a very interesting system called octopus there .
now i know we can develop the technology that &apos;s going to make this work , but we &apos;ve got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven &apos;t even thought of yet ; our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure must support all the future options .
thank you .
6 : 20 .
things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient &apos;s room so that it signified , &quot; this is my room . this is my personal space &quot; -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem .
when you &apos;re having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine -- which was the procedure that this device &apos;s data was about ; it was for pain management -- you &apos;re shit scared ; you &apos;re freaking out .
we sort of assume that because there &apos;s a pole in the street , that it &apos;s okay to use it , so we park our shopping cart there .
so , what came out of this ?
children can use it . adults can use it . everybody uses it .
is it luck ? is it chance ?
and we did . the data was conclusive .
k and because of that , ahmedabad is known as india &apos;s first child-friendly city .
girl : 581 . this house is 581 ...
like i said , contagious is a good word .
he was a design scientist , if you like , a poet , but he foresaw all the things that are happening now .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not the answer .
in other words , it is accelerating by a factor of 10 .
we were fortunate , because in a way our building was future-proofed .
and again , the way in which that works as a building , for those of us who can enjoy the spaces , to live and visit there .
but meanwhile , as you know , wonderful protagonists like al gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature , set in the context of that , interestingly , those buildings which are celebratory and very , very relevant to this place .
so it also has the ability , all the time , regardless of the direction of the wind , to be able to make the building fresh and efficient .
250 -- excuse me , 50,000 people working 24 hours , seven days .
and the same is more or less what santiago calatrava said when he said , &quot; light : i make it in my buildings for comfort . &quot;
it has only on one side this big , big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range .
and behind them , you see that seagram building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design .
because if we look at the earth the way it should be , it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything .
and the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant .
in all of these examples , i think , we should start making the light out of darkness , and use the darkness as a canvas -- like the visual artists do , like edward hopper in this painting .
the point that we have been stressing for the last 21 years , the point that people may be economically poor , but they &apos;re not poor in the mind .
so i did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research , wrote , read about 100 papers .
anybody ? any guess at all ?
doing what ? breaking stones , digging earth .
so on the wayside we found these dung cakes , which are used as a fuel .
they have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy , in terms of cost , in terms of quality .
they have to be better , they have to be more efficient , they have to be affordable .
saidullah sahib is an amazing man .
remya jose has developed ...
they were not related to her , but they tried to find out , &quot; how can we use ... &quot; they used a cycle , they put together a breathing apparatus .
i could have told them that .
and by the way , as i take shots at old technologies , i want to assure everybody , and particularly the automotive industry -- who &apos;s been very supportive of us -- that i don &apos;t think this in any way competes with airplanes , or cars .
if -- in china , in the year 1998 , 417 million people used bicycles ; 1.7 million people used cars .
i took this down to ground zero , and knocked my way through crowds for an hour .
then she looks up , she &apos;s looking up , and she says , &quot; and i &apos;m 81 years old , and i don &apos;t drive a car anymore .
and we &apos;re hoping to some extent history will say we were right .
i &apos;d like to dedicate this next song to carmelo , who was put to sleep a couple of days ago , because he got too old .
and so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died .
now , as a business professor , and as any business professor would tell you , an effective organization requires an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure , good incentives , a solid identity and good brand management .
their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement , so they invest heavily in providing local services , like dealing with home violence , going after petty criminals , treating addicts , and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are , and , of course , protecting people from other criminal organizations .
and so , differences aside , what these three organizations share is on the one hand , a very clear understanding that institutions cannot be imposed from the top , but rather they are built from the bottom up one interaction at a time .
you &apos;ve probably seen something like this before .
the dvd , as you know , was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive . but you can see that by 1998 , it had fallen below 400 dollars , and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold .
as you probably know , gene sequencing -- in a large part , because it &apos;s built on computers -- is falling in price at a kind of a moore &apos;s law-like level .
another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars .
you know , there could be a film &apos;s &#91; unclear &#93; there , but it &apos;s basically , every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008 . it takes that entire element , the physical element , of songs off the table .
and by definition , every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul , a global citizen .
it recognizes that the market has its limitation , and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people .
in other words , that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest , or else they wouldn &apos;t take the risk .
and it &apos;s where the idea of partnership becomes so important .
and we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color , lots of heat , very little discussion , because we were exhausted .
not only to inspire innovation and risk taking , but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet .
so , besides this freakish thing , this is my science slide . this is math , and this is science ; this is genetics .
you can laugh , this is ok .
and i decided to break from , &quot; i don &apos;t really write about my public life , &quot; because i wanted to give her a little memorial .
twenty-eight comments . that &apos;s not a huge amount of people reading , but 28 people matter .
this is all i have . i have a couple of facts about somebody .
and her sister came on , and she said that emma had passed away . and all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional , and it was a very hard day at the company .
this fish was revered by humankind .
technology has come of age that &apos;s allowing us to see the earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely .
here , for over 14 or 15 years , we &apos;ve actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity .
and from our data that gets collected , when that tag comes back , because a fisher returns it for a thousand-dollar reward , we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now , on a backboned animal .
three tunas tagged .
salmon sharks aren &apos;t the only sharks we tag .
so what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are .
make killer apps , if you will .
and when most of us get asked , &quot; where were you september 12th ? &quot;
by the way , you folks know that in the united states , you can &apos;t take photographs of federal buildings , but google can do it for you .
a couple weeks later , i &apos;d call again , let them know .
this is in warsaw .
sometimes you just get this , just an empty hallway in salt lake city , january 22nd .
and on sunday , june 14th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o &apos;clock in the afternoon in skowhegan , maine -- this was my apartment there .
and you know , some of my friends have always said , &quot; hey , you &apos;re just paranoid . why are you doing this ?
and everything &apos;s automated at the other end .
the pink dots represent host properties .
but the key reason why it &apos;s taking off now so fast is because every new advancement of technology increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust to make sharing easier and easier .
now , when you think about it , it &apos;s amazing , right , that over the past 20 years , we &apos;ve evolved from trusting people online to share information to trusting to handing over our credit card information , and now we &apos;re entering the third trust wave : connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds of people-powered marketplaces .
what the likes of sebastian are starting to rightfully ask is , shouldn &apos;t they own their reputation data ?
ultimately , when we get it right , reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power , trust and influence .
in the 20th century , the invention of traditional credit transformed our consumer system , and in many ways controlled who had access to what .
and of course the infamous -- what was his name ? -- the infamous gordon gekko from &quot; wall street &quot; said , &quot; money never sleeps . &quot;
okay . so where have we got to ?
however , it &apos;s not just the laying down of memory and recalling it .
so the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor , again in that sort of five-hour region .
so it &apos;s a short-term acute measure , but for goodness sake , don &apos;t become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night .
well , it &apos;s not rocket science .
simple as that .
the neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep , give you normal sleep , and those that give you normal mental health are overlapping .
if you get sleep , it reduces your mood changes , your stress , your levels of anger , your impulsivity , and your tendency to drink and take drugs .
the explanation of that paradox is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at relative income or social position , social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us .
here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality .
this is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year .
and as we like to say -- and i know there are a lot of americans in the audience here -- if americans want to live the american dream , they should go to denmark .
there seems to be some truth in john donne &apos;s &quot; no man is an island . &quot;
those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress .
richard wilkinson : how economic inequality harms societies
it &apos;s got a microprocessor inside .
and you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s struggling with stability as he &apos;s walking .
so do you see that black strip right there ?
we have fit over 5,000 amputees , and one of the big indicators we &apos;re looking at , of course , is , does it improve lives ?
so for me , choreography is very much a process of physical thinking . it &apos;s very much in mind , as well as in body , and it &apos;s a collaborative process .
it has a kind of a grammar . i know what i &apos;m going to do with it , and i can start to describe it , so i can describe it very simply . i can describe it in my arms , right ?
some dancers , when they &apos;re watching action , take the overall shape , the arc of the movement , the kinetic sense of the movement , and use that for memory .
underneath . jump . paolo , kick . don &apos;t care where . kick .
that was the second way of working .
okay ? okay . ladies and gentlemen , world premiere , ted dance , three versions of physical thinking .
you &apos;ve got to pay for your soap , your deodorant , toothbrush , toothpaste , all of it .
the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new skills that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back .
it &apos;s a delight to use .
so i type &quot; design emotion &quot; and my website wasn &apos;t first again .
she brought students in to solve problems .
we dislike scolding voices . we dislike frowning faces ; we like symmetrical faces , etc . , etc .
or this -- this is a really neat teapot i found at high tea at the four seasons hotel in chicago .
it &apos;s about attention . it &apos;s about their image , not about the car .
the first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education .
when you take education and technology , then i find in the literature that , you know , things like websites , collaborative environments -- you &apos;ve been listening to all that in the morning -- it &apos;s always piloted first in the best schools , the best urban schools , and , according to me , biases the result .
they cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful pc into that hole , sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end , a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall , put it on high-speed internet , put the internet explorer there , put it on altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there .
people said , you know , you really ought to have this in indian languages .
this is the desert to the west . near the pakistan border .
if you test them , all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them .
but other examples are traffic jams , stock market , society and disaster recovery , terrorism and insurgency .
it &apos;s inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it .
renny gleeson : you just ... no , he &apos;s not okay .
i don &apos;t believe in straightforward narratives .
being a diplomat , then and now , is an incredible job , and i loved every minute of it -- i enjoyed the status of it .
although i worked very long hours , i lived in a penthouse in union square .
and so i was in crisis .
18 people were killed .
that was the origin of the thing that became independent diplomat , the world &apos;s first diplomatic advisory group and a non-profit to boot .
we all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office .
what that means is , instead of asking your politicians to do things , you have to look to yourself to do things .
so we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought , what can we do about it .
now i happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
moral ambiguity starts to climb .
this was the first show that allowed viewers to say , &quot; my god , i can comment on how i feel about the vietnam war , about the presidency , through television ? &quot;
so here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years .
the 1950s : june cleever in the original comfort show , &quot; leave it to beaver . &quot;
not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool , why it &apos;s so important .
the workers still come the next day , they do their job , but they &apos;re following different instructions .
i used to work for an educational publisher , and as a writer , i was always told never to use stories or fun , engaging language , because then my work might not be viewed as &quot; serious &quot; and &quot; scientific . &quot;
right ? you want to be like , &quot; oh , dude , we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness . &quot;
pick up a camera , start to write a blog , whatever , but leave out the seriousness , leave out the jargon .
we climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness .
so many books about war say the same thing , that nothing brings people together like war .
durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .
in other words , charles darwin believed in group selection .
so here &apos;s how things play out .
and it happened again , even more spectacularly , in the last half-million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures , they came together around a hearth or a campfire , they divided labor , they began painting their bodies , they spoke their own dialects , and eventually they worshiped their own gods .
this is why politics is so tribal .
&quot; no man is an island entire of itself .
and this , to me , is a pretty classic manspace .
and so there is a good reason for this .
many people would say , well , that &apos;s very easy .
it &apos;s just given to you .
certainly not .
that &apos;s all .
mostly it &apos;s the opportunity to enjoy , but sometimes it &apos;s something more difficult .
the one thing all humans have in common is that each of us wants to be happy , says brother david steindl-rast , a monk and interfaith scholar . and happiness , he suggests , is born from gratitude . an inspiring lesson in slowing down , looking where you &apos;re going , and above all , being grateful .
same color , same message , same words .
i think it &apos;s not the only ingredient in design , but possibly the most important .
it now has no relevance to the book whatsoever , but it &apos;s a nice spread , i think , in there .
got no way of tracking it , so i could be totally wrong .
and the umbrella campaign was &quot; thank god it &apos;s monday . &quot;
having done a lot of magazines , i &apos;m very curious how big magazines handle big stories , and i was very curious to see how time and newsweek would handle 9 / 11 .
we are wrapping up .
and i started thinking about some of these decisions i have to make between , like , serif versus san-serif .
before that , obviously , technology didn &apos;t exist . but obviously it did .
and one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects , just to see what &apos;s on life . and if we did that with our little martian probe , which we have not done on earth , we would begin to see some incredible species .
the second thing is is we see diversity . we also see specialization .
so the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution . the same drives that we see towards ubiquity , towards diversity , towards socialization , towards complexity . that is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out , say , the evolution of armor , you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree .
all of them are still being produced . so you &apos;ve got corn shellers .
the origins of technology was not in 1829 , but was actually at the beginning of the big bang , and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed . the entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot , and it was so tight in there , there was no room for any difference at all .
all the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology . this is the infinite game .
both of these machines are capable of automatically identifying a human target and firing on it , the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer .
the pentagon &apos;s gorgon stare and argus programs will put up to 65 independently operated camera eyes on each drone platform , and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it .
and these types of maps can be automatically generated based on the data trail modern people leave behind .
i think the secret will be transparency .
and this delta water flows to mobile bay , and finally into the gulf of mexico .
he reaches up , takes another armful of gravel , releases it -- chk chk chk chk chk ! -- same thing .
so our first challenge was to find these things , and that was a challenge , indeed .
and as you go down , the washing machine at the surface calms down .
and living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals : shrimp , fish , lobsters , crab , clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold .
and you turn around , and there &apos;s a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in , and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth .
my answer to that is don &apos;t look at the big , overwhelming issues of the world .
mike degruy : hooked by an octopus
i found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions .
these phosphors can even cause cancer .
let me explain .
now what if you put together women and humor ?
my work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world -- countries such as saudi arabia , iran , turkey , argentina , france -- and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties .
and so there &apos;s an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities .
all companies die , all companies .
this is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us , particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner : hockey sticks .
and you &apos;re very familiar with these networks .
it &apos;s an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on .
if it &apos;s social networks with super-linear scaling -- more per capita -- then the theory says that you increase the pace of life .
we could use sales , anything you like .
fast-forward a generation : this is the one-room schoolhouse , oak grove , where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse .
it was theirs . it was experiential . it was authentic .
we are a nine through 12 public school , but we do school quite differently .
didn &apos;t read anything . &quot; there it is . &quot;
diabetes , cancer , parkinson &apos;s , alzheimer &apos;s , heart failure , lung failure -- things that we know are debilitating diseases , for which there &apos;s relatively little that can be done .
one of the challenges is that the richer we are , the longer we live .
one thing you can do is not treat . you can ration health care .
i &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept .
the picture i &apos;m about to show you however , for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish -- even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends -- the lights are down . this is a good time to look at your feet , check your blackberry , do anything other than look at the screen .
this is a 78 year-old man who &apos;s lost the end of his fingertip .
this was a randomized trial .
many of those patients are very severely burned .
china , the same thing .
and while i don &apos;t have any patents that i &apos;m aware of , you will be meeting a few of my inventions today .
that means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work .
but i -- i also appreciate the diversity that you have here .
sorry , this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything , to be here right now .
at my school -- actually i was part of co-founding an organization , which is like a leadership thing , you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything .
and it was madame bousson , you know , she was very &#91; french &#93; .
but i do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize , if you saw &quot; bridge and tunnel . &quot;
and she doesn &apos;t want me to come and visit .
and i see that a few of them did make it here to the conference .
the whole thing is amazing , and so don &apos;t you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon .
but perhaps the other , bigger gap is what we call the hope gap .
and needless to say , i was right .
and a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that i find really is powerful .
perhaps more importantly , tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs that we created to go around the movies .
and for participant , this is just the start .
oh , thank you .
and like i tell my family , and my wife reminds me every time , &quot; you &apos;re risking your life , you know , every time you go to that country . &quot;
all right , this is a slide from a talk i gave about intensive care units in nigeria , and jokingly we refer to it as &quot; expensive scare . &quot;
but we had problems with it . we had severe problems there .
that &apos;s what he was doing , propping up the bed because the bed simply didn &apos;t work .
so that &apos;s not new . what we &apos;re doing is applying this technology to it .
and so i committed -- when i left south africa , when i left capetown , i told myself , &quot; this is going to be something that i have to talk about .
i &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- i went to about 12 different countries .
and here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
on january 24th , apple computer will introduce macintosh .
and many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles .
and that &apos;s done in part with the help from western technology .
after all , companies didn &apos;t stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course , or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course , just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do .
so what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime ?
we prefer to know them as the mafia .
but what about the democratic republic of congo ?
so what were these guys doing with all the money they were making ?
this , however , may all be about to change , because something very strange is going on .
or to use the technical term for it , there &apos;s one born every minute .
it is a major economic force and we need to take it very , very seriously .
the ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees ; our ancestors went out onto the plain .
you &apos;ve been constructing fanciful things on top of it , relying on it to be as solid as a rock .
he kept it to himself for 30 years .
as an absolute connection , it only works one way .
you can &apos;t even train a gorilla to say &quot; ah &quot; on request .
the answer to that , loud and clear , is , &quot; yes ! they can all be wrong . &quot;
and we can move forward from there , and really get somewhere .
elaine morgan was a tenacious proponent of a theory that is , ahem , not widely accepted . the aquatic ape hypothesis lays out the idea that humans evolved from primate ancestors who dwelt in watery habitats . hear her spirited defense of the idea -- and her theory on why science doesn &apos;t take it seriously .
i &apos;m really sorry .
in march of 2001 -- i filmed myself dancing to madonna &apos;s &quot; justify my love . &quot;
and so , this year , chris sent us a ted conference simulator .
and this is great because , you know , for a quarter , you can play this for a long time .
so , the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool .
you actually put action to the issues you care about .
it &apos;s a letter .
if you had the right information , you would have done the right thing . &quot;
politicians are strange creatures , says politician omar ahmad . and the best way to engage them on your pet issue is a monthly handwritten letter . ahmad shows why old-fashioned correspondence is more effective than email , phone or even writing a check -- and shares the four simple steps to writing a letter that works .
my grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years .
so more and more we &apos;re trying to find ways for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves , to be creative even as they &apos;re looking at other people &apos;s creativity and understanding them .
voice 1 : i was in honolulu , hawaii . voice 2 : i was in cairo , egypt .
&quot; how could 9 / 11 have happened ? &quot;
today , of course , there &apos;s an unprecedented amount of stories for all of us that are being captured for future generations .
it &apos;s fairly self-explanatory .
and so i would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that i could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me .
and once again , it &apos;s this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug .
all right , now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid , but look at these graphs that levin showed .
think of it like this .
but it is a gross distortion of reality .
you know , ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale .
from my experience , and from what i &apos;ve heard from congressional insiders , most of the people going to congress are good , hard-working , intelligent people who really want to solve problems , but once they get there , they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship and that punishes independent thinking .
we &apos;ve all seen versions of this graph , right , which shows the changes in wealth since 1979 , and as you can see , almost all the gains in wealth have gone to the top 20 percent , and especially the top one percent .
when americans go to college and marry each other , they have very low divorce rates .
and most surprisingly to me , they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice .
and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another , either through the production or the absorption of energy .
that can &apos;t be energetically sensible .
we don &apos;t just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals .
so i &apos;m a woman with chronic schizophrenia .
my doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia , and gave me a prognosis of &quot; grave . &quot;
but schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status , and there are people with the illness who are full-time professionals with major responsibilities .
i had two earlier in england .
i didn &apos;t have the courage to tell him in that moment that , no , we &apos;re not that different from him .
tell them not to kill me . what have i done wrong ?
also , we must stop criminalizing mental illness .
and then i decided i &apos;d dedicate my life to saving one million people every year .
do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people ?
this is prickly pear creek .
they &apos;re concerned about securing an adequate supply of water , they &apos;re trying to be really efficient with their water use , and they &apos;re concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand .
this individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion , leaving the water in the stream .
so i edit this site for teenage girls . i &apos;m a feminist .
and this is an excerpt from my first editor &apos;s letter , where i say that rookie , we don &apos;t have all the answers , we &apos;re still figuring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves , but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , all of that , and rookie , i think we &apos;ve been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out .
actually , he was meditating on compassion .
and maybe because of that , compassion is organic and widespread company-wide .
the first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders .
it makes us a highly effective company .
therefore , any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training .
thank you .
and we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the confessions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
and then he said , &quot; but i want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . &quot;
and i was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , &quot; how can we get this out ? how can we make sure that this is implemented ?
so i thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
you know when they do homeworks at home ?
it can be a school of design in jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people , because , as you know , israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies .
hella jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious .
so , designers sometimes don &apos;t do things that are immediately functional , but they &apos;re functional to our understanding of issues .
many years ago i heard a mathematician from vienna , whose name was marchetti , explain how the innovation in the military industry -- therefore , secret innovation -- and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed .
so what &apos;s image got do with it ?
and they adopted a very interesting approach to education , which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford .
disease .
how would you look at me ?
so we need to start getting better .
and i can &apos;t emphasize that enough , you know .
what are they doing ?
my cousin ran out of school fees , and she &apos;s really smart .
and if they don &apos;t admit you , they &apos;re the ones who are messed up . &quot;
with syria to the north , israel and palestine to the south , and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable .
in october 2003 , over 6,000 runners from 49 different nationalities came to the start line , all determined , and when the gunfire went off , this time it was a signal to run in harmony for a change .
bma has supported charities and volunteers who have helped reshape lebanon , raising funds for their causes and encouraging others to give .
and that &apos;s his actual photograph .
by the time i step down from here there will be 10 people who have lost their lives through a completely , completely preventable problem .
but fundamentally , what i believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia .
but if we place these technologies before student inquiry , we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers : our students &apos; questions .
and each case is different .
so going in , what was qatar in the 1940s ?
and we realized that there are some differences in accents .
how could we survive that ?
we only have two days of water reserve .
so that &apos;s what we are planning to do .
it helped martin luther king win a historic racial struggle .
it took us 10 years to unite 18 opposition party leaders , with their big egos , behind one single candidate against balkan dictator slobodan milosevic .
they &apos;re very useful in a violent oppression .
there is also one big thing about the humor : it really hurts , because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously .
if you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy , you will see that out of 67 different cases , in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power .
youtube , they &apos;re putting this thing on youtube .
there &apos;s two things that i &apos;ve learned in the last year .
when i became a &quot; vulnerability researcher &quot; and that became the focus because of the tedtalk -- and i &apos;m not kidding .
and i did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability .
and he said , &quot; and it didn &apos;t work .
i know those things that happened to you growing up .
everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame .
when we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us .
and we just want , for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with , to dare greatly .
in the middle we have a motor , and we also have a gear in it , and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor .
his mission and his message is about the aravind eye care system .
an implicit faith in you and then you respond to it .
and this happens several thousand times each year .
this is a very busy table , but what this really is conveying is that , when it comes to quality , we have put in very good quality-assurance systems .
so we &apos;re really comparing apples to apples .
that &apos;s my question .
it &apos;s fairly simple .
it &apos;s wonderful to be here to talk about my journey , to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me .
and the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years .
california is basically the equivalent of europe , in this .
the aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters , all one billion of them , are building the urban world , which means they &apos;re building the world -- personally , one by one , family by family , clan by clan , neighborhood by neighborhood .
it &apos;s much more interactive .
this is what makes cities -- this is what makes cities so green in the developing world .
the climate news , i &apos;m sorry to say , is going to keep getting worse than we think , faster than we think .
just ask the coal miners in australia .
and i was glad to see that president obama supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy when he spoke in prague the other week .
that would be considered an act of war by both nations .
and what they &apos;re finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton , which is very bad news , because so much life depends on it .
but climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution , but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our gdp .
so it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides -- for society at least .
the earth always did have limits .
you can &apos;t just drill a hole and pump it out .
the idea behind this form of &quot; geoengineering &quot; as it &apos;s called , is that , as the planet heats up , we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun &apos;s rays back to space , thereby cooling the planet .
dh : now obviously , this is not something we do on our regular show ; it &apos;s something we just kind of learned for this , so we &apos;re going to try . but can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs ?
i &apos;m now pushing my luck : i &apos;m skipping right to six cups .
dh : all right , please stand here in front ...
dh : could you spread your legs a little bit ?
even the pencil .
we went too far .
dh : that &apos;s right .
you are my hero . you &apos;re my jim shea , jr .
dh : thank you very much !
and i &apos;m going to take you through the architecture of the machine — that &apos;s why it &apos;s computer architecture — and tell you about this machine , which is a computer .
babbage , of course , wanted to use proven technology , so steam and things .
it &apos;s not , historically , totally accurate that she &apos;s the first programmer , and actually , she did something more amazing .
you could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to .
how many are there in the human genome ? three billion .
it &apos;s called the beijing genomics institute .
significant problems remained .
which is a fantastic story , unless you think about humanity &apos;s footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production .
so anybody who &apos;s here today with your significant other , just turn over to them and swab their mouth , send it to the lab and you &apos;ll know for sure .
and like any new technology , it &apos;s really in humanity &apos;s hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind , or not .
and the marrow miner , the way it works is shown here .
we &apos;ve just come out , we &apos;re commercializing , this year , generation 2.0 of the marrow miner .
and it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities , just like a coral .
quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized .
the main purpose of the large hadron collider is to see this higgs particle , and we &apos;re almost certain it will .
if a particle and an anti-particle collide , it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions .
and we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we &apos;ll see when experiments reach higher energies .
the pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful , and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles , each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape .
well , pretty bad .
but i also greatly enjoy the company of hyper-intelligent people .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll be able to make this any clearer .
so it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us , in certain aspects of their behavior .
so it &apos;s pretty sad to find that chimpanzees , like so many other creatures around the world , are losing their habitats .
they were interested in health ; they were interested in education .
the water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we &apos;re going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural , industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world , seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience .
see the brick wall as all these problems we &apos;ve inflicted on the planet , environmental and social . it &apos;s a message of hope .
so , there &apos;s no time for more roots and shoots now .
and that &apos;s what ted is helping so well with , and google who help us , and esri are helping us with mapping in gombe national park .
and it was very , very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people , when they are empowered , given the opportunity to take action , to make the world a better place , truly are our hope for tomorrow .
and they came into my room the next morning .
a lot of our students get into theater .
how many of you in this audience know somebody who started off in pre-med or engineering and changed their major within a year or two ?
test scores are important , but they &apos;re not the most important thing .
they knew they were working on aids research .
if you don &apos;t know it , there &apos;s been a 79-percent decline in the number of women majoring in computer science just since 2000 .
i then , in the last few years , learned about the pacific garbage patch and the gyre .
it is down-cycled and turned into lesser things , while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again -- a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again .
i &apos;m wearing a camera , just a simple webcam , a portable , battery-powered projection system with a little mirror .
this is juan &apos;s book , our previous speaker , which gets a great rating , by the way , at amazon .
at the time , we knew that it was political .
so the story with zacarias was too much really .
and aicha started , and she said , &quot; i don &apos;t know if my son is guilty or innocent , but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families .
now i see you &apos;ve all been enjoying the water that &apos;s been provided for you here at the conference , over the past couple of days .
now i spent a lot of time in my garage , over the next weeks and months , and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife .
you just scoop the water up .
then , after a few weeks , we set up camps .
so with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the millennium goal &apos;s target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water .
and the second is about some new dimension which i want to refer to , which has never quite happened in the way it &apos;s happening now .
the world needs an international forum .
you &apos;re beginning to see the emergence of a multi-polar world .
take the last financial crisis after the second world war .
but now we are intimately locked together .
if it is the case , ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before , then it &apos;s also the case that we share a destiny with each other .
but if you ask the average american what the optimal formula of longevity is , they probably couldn &apos;t tell you .
it reminds me of my college days .
these are years that we could get .
and in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity .
but , like sardinia , okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity .
and i asked her what it felt like to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter .
adventists also tend to hang out with other adventists .
and we managed to boil it down to nine .
they tend to eat a plant-based diet .
but now we have these amazing , futuristic composites -- plastics that change shape , paints that conduct electricity , pigments that change color , fabrics that light up .
first of all , because we can &apos;t shape what we don &apos;t understand , and what we don &apos;t understand and use ends up shaping us .
so the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity , and we are not afraid to fail .
but i had no idea that car was stopping , and i think we can do a lot better than that .
if that guy &apos;s going down to zero , i &apos;ll know .
what happens if two cars share that data , if they talk to each other ?
i think it &apos;s a very disconcerting notion , this idea that our cars will be watching us , talking about us to other cars , that we &apos;ll be going down the road in a sea of gossip .
you take an airplane , you fly over the top , you &apos;re weightless for 25 seconds .
we had everything all set in case of an emergency ; god knows , you don &apos;t want to hurt this world-renowned expert .
if you look at the math , e = mc squared , if you look at the cosmological constant , where there &apos;s an anthropic ideal , where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand .
but these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing , and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other .
i quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in february of that same year , and decided to travel .
i couldn &apos;t afford to find an apartment , or couldn &apos;t afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat .
and when i realized that tim russert , former moderator of &quot; meet the press , &quot; was talking about my writing , while i was living in a van in a wal-mart parking lot , i started laughing .
three years ago i was living in a van in a wal-mart parking lot , and today i &apos;m speaking at ted .
so we went to the ordinary people that you saw .
very good , mother . move ahead .
and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
of course i can . and they &apos;d enjoy it immensely ; i see them standing around right now , everywhere .
there was political commitment , some financial commitment , and everybody joined in the fight .
now we &apos;re making scottish tartans , as you can see on the left , to sell to all people of scottish ancestors .
so just by a show of hands , how many of you all have a robot at home ?
and romo will actually stream video to this device .
you can imagine an eight-year-old girl , for example , who has an iphone , and her mom buys her a robot .
keller rinaudo : a mini robot -- powered by your phone
by the middle of february , i found myself in turin , where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 olympic teams was in the street .
i looked like a refrigerator .
by the way , 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls .
they have no control over their bodies or their lives .
the next morning , when she comes again to the so-called clinic , her first patient is waiting for her with her husband .
in any war today , most of the casualties are civilians , mainly women and children . they are collateral damage .
yes , i would love to have sophia loren &apos;s long legs and legendary breasts .
so meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand .
famously , rome had about a million citizens by the first century a.d .
and , in fact , if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age , you can trace food coming in to it .
now it &apos;s anonymous .
i believe we already live in sitopia .
we &apos;re going to see them more like this , as part of the productive , organic framework of which they are inevitably a part , symbiotically connected .
think about what you might pick .
the contest said , send in your numbers and whoever is close to two-thirds of the average will win a big prize .
so we classify people by what they picked , and then we look at the difference between playing humans versus playing computers , which brain areas are differentially active .
and the way they bargain is to point on a number line that goes from zero to six dollars , and they &apos;re bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets , and the informed player &apos;s going to get the rest .
this is from the first two seconds .
then they disappear and they &apos;re replaced by squares , and they have to press the squares that correspond to the numbers from low to high to get an apple reward .
this is a graph of the percentage of times the matcher picked right on the x-axis , and the percentage of times they predicted right by the mismatcher on the y-axis .
colin camerer : neuroscience , game theory , monkeys
this is the source of all morality , this imaginative act of empathy , putting yourself in the place of another .
i &apos;d like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people &apos;s traditions .
who knew about extension managers ?
and i began to think about how i could communicate this in book form .
over the spanish steps we go .
he gets up , leaps onto his scooter , races through the city past the church of santa maria della pace , down the alleys , through the streets that tourists may be wandering through , disturbing the quiet backstreet life of rome at every turn .
that was the first attempt , but it didn &apos;t seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was i wanted to convey about rome .
ok , if i don &apos;t open the book the whole way , if i just open it 90 degrees , we &apos;re looking down the front of the pantheon , and we &apos;re looking sort of at the top , more or less down on the square .
and i forgot to mention this : whenever he lost a pigeon , he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city .
and if you do want to see santa maria della pace , these books are really flexible , incredibly interactive -- just turn it around and look at it the other way .
and i think the key to that is self-assembly .
the other one is from the previous brick that was placed .
so you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional , two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively .
i think there &apos;s a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on earth is over , that for the next generation they &apos;re going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore .
but we &apos;d also see something very , very surprising .
nathan wolfe : what &apos;s left to explore ?
what does a typical place in the universe look like ?
the one physical system , the brain , contains an accurate working model of the other -- the quasar .
in other words , it &apos;s a matter of knowledge , not resources .
so let me now apply this to a current controversy , not because i want to advocate any particular solution , but just to illustrate the kind of thing i mean .
it poses a very fascinating puzzle for us .
so if you give just to one side or the other , you &apos;ll have tension or friction .
so as other countries in the world innovated , in the sense both of developing newer technologies , but also developing newer rules , the chinese were cut off from those advances .
if you try to change the rules in a village , you could do that , but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules .
in some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility , a delegation of control from one country to another to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities .
many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule .
you wouldn &apos;t want to let us run the cities , go out and design them .
and this will be my only comment on it .
we &apos;ve extended this to the air now with a grant from the sloan foundation .
and we have really nice t-shirts that say , you know , &quot; i heart my genitalium . &quot;
basically , any virus that &apos;s been sequenced today -- that genome can be made .
so we know lots of different pathways , thousands of different organisms now that live off of co2 , and can capture that back .
i want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time , in a very short time .
the kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the sat .
there is two ways to be past-oriented , two ways to be future .
i just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems : changing the drop-out rates of school kids , combating addictions , enhancing teen health , curing vets &apos; ptsd with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures -- promoting sustainability and conservation , reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate , altering appeals to suicidal terrorists , and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes .
some recent stories : nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom ; they &apos;re sending genes into the brain ; a robot they built that can crawl through the human body .
and here &apos;s a beautiful picture of the andromeda nebula , which is our closest , largest spiral galaxy to the milky way .
but despite that cold , you could have rain falling down on the surface of titan .
and i just want to emphasize how significant an event this is .
and then finally , the probe came to rest on the surface , and i &apos;m going to show you , ladies and gentlemen , the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system .
but the mother lode of discoveries on enceladus was found at the south pole -- and we &apos;re looking at the south pole here -- where we found this system of fractures .
carolyn porco : this is saturn
but i think the girls could do it .
violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common ; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause .
but i have seen first hand that if we do , they will multiply .
in the last year alone , thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information , and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable .
and when it fires a little spike of electricity , there &apos;s going to be a red dot and a click .
but on some trials , we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell .
and he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car .
and why is it that the wright brothers were able to figure out controlled , powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified , better funded ...
it &apos;s obvious . we go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing .
but we &apos;re also perfectly comfortable buying an mp3 player from apple , or a phone from apple , or a dvr from apple .
