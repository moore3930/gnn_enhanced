and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to preserve when we say , &quot; save the ocean . heal the ocean . &quot;
in mother &apos;s milk .
that &apos;s a tragedy for those populations , but it &apos;s also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don &apos;t know that that &apos;s toxic meat .
how many people have seen a &quot; beach closed &quot; sign ?
so what do you do ?
it &apos;s an ocean planet , and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species , but the pyramid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intricately connected .
and in a way that &apos;s a metaphor for life .
ak : it &apos;s about a boy who falls in love with a horse .
ak : a month later , we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .
come here . stand here where people can see you .
but we realized that , if that were to be happening , you wouldn &apos;t , as an audience , see the breath .
the sound that that very large chest makes , of the horse -- the whinnying and the nickering and everything -- that starts usually with one performer , carries on with a second person and ends with a third .
but of course , we &apos;ve spread to every corner of the globe and in arctic canada , where i live , we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter .
they got two times as much money .
one even asks , like you just saw , is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick ?
and we were really interested in who &apos;s more likely to offer help to another person , someone who &apos;s rich or someone who &apos;s poor .
what we found was that as the expensiveness of a car increased , the driver &apos;s tendencies to break the law increased as well .
so what do we do ?
i &apos;ve been following this change for quite a while now , and participating in it .
think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy .
and this , of course , tackles the biggest assumption of all , that business is business , and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world .
our future doesn &apos;t have to be imagined .
the pictures that you &apos;re seeing behind me are people that i visited in the last few months .
or a mother who , at four o &apos;clock , suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home .
but basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sphere was left behind you .
i really think that the number is conservative .
now , california &apos;s considering similar legislation , and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas .
we line that up with data that we record from a professional driver , and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable .
now , the strategy for driving this as explained to me was , you aim for the bush in the distance , and as the road falls away , you realize it was actually the top of a tree .
we &apos;ve started to ask the question : can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive ?
she hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees , harvest the honey and make value-added products that they marketed themselves , and that were later sold at whole foods .
that kind of technology is called &quot; mountaintop removal . &quot;
and she might not get to see that mountaintop .
another problem : unhealthy food systems and unemployment .
the recession has us reeling and fearful , and there &apos;s something in the air these days that is also very empowering .
but listen , i did feel obligated to him , and i grew up -- then i grew up .
what we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises , who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
and when i was an adolescent , i thought that i &apos;m gay , and so i probably can &apos;t have a family .
those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence .
one of the dwarfs i got to know was a guy named clinton brown .
true guilt arises only from an offense against a person , and a down &apos;s is not a person . &quot;
there are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before , making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies , or to terminate them .
&quot; so while i recognize that it would have been better for the world if dylan had never been born , i &apos;ve decided that it would not have been better for me . &quot;
the day after our son was born , the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned .
andrew solomon : love , no matter what
didn &apos;t have to worry about earning money .
it &apos;s really important . using applications is ok , but programming is absolutely fundamental .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the crank -- it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
it &apos;s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . these can talk to each other .
not something you &apos;d envy or want to do .
tell people about it ! it &apos;s got to become viral , ok ?
now at the time that i was reading this , it was the middle of the winter and i definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my new york city apartment .
so for example , jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps .
britta riley wanted to grow her own food . so she and her friends developed a system for growing plants in discarded plastic bottles -- researching , testing and tweaking the system using social media , trying many variations at once and quickly arriving at the optimal system . call it distributed diy . and the results ? delicious . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
we &apos;re going to give this away i think , chris said , after the talk .
couldn &apos;t do a lot in the main rubble pile , things were just too -- there was nothing left to do .
now notice , he nodded there , he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication .
and over here on the right , this is what we call the steven spielberg memorial module .
here we asked them to get the robot &apos;s attention and indicate when they have the robot &apos;s attention .
ritchie : can you do the same thing ? robot : yeah , sure .
they want to take over from us .
and this is what the inevitable problem looks like .
it &apos;s good to let markets move resources to their more productive use .
raise medical health care contributions ?
now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
or , &quot; do you think the government should redistribute ? &quot;
but the more we address it as a practical concern , the sooner we can resolve it , and the more time we have to resolve it , paradoxically .
remember that ?
but it might be .
it &apos;s the last thing she did , the last physical act .
it means something triggering a big emotional response , often quite a sad emotional response , but it &apos;s part of what we do .
and as a designer , i can &apos;t help meddling with this , so i pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this , and tried to understand what the individual elements were , but feeling it as i go .
that &apos;s how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel .
no one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
so we &apos;re going to have a little experiment .
the knowledge bubble that sits around the outside , the stuff that costs nothing , because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together and where do we come out ?
of course , there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels , etc .
that &apos;s a lovely idea .
we &apos;re only just holding it together .
so religions are cultures of repetition .
but if you &apos;re a zen buddhist in the middle of september , you will be ordered out of your home , made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of tsukimi , where you will be given poems to read in honor of the moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of .
we don &apos;t tend to do that .
essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
first of all , scale , might .
now this is actually a courageous talk , because you &apos;re kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters .
it seems to me that there &apos;s plenty of people in the ted community who are atheists .
i had bought a copy of this book , &quot; the universe and dr. einstein &quot; -- a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in seattle .
this is one of the largest underground labs in the world .
and you have to imagine , there &apos;s an entire sea-like lake underneath , moving .
finally , i want to take you to antarctica .
and what they have to do is they have to assemble the entire balloon -- the fabric , parachute and everything -- on the ice and then fill it up with helium .
this is a close-up of the buddhist monastery .
then the question is , what do you get ?
and it &apos;s called the &quot; espresso book machine , &quot; and in about 10 minutes , you can press a button and make a book .
but a million books , i think , actually would be a pretty good start , and that would cost 30 million dollars . that &apos;s not that big a bill .
moving images : if you think of theatrical releases , there are not that many of them .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
and you &apos;ll have a lifetime supply of good drugs .
we all know the earth is in trouble .
fungi don &apos;t like to rot from bacteria , and so our best antibiotics come from fungi .
the mycelium is sentient .
dr. boyce , at the university of chicago , published an article in the journal of geology this past year determining that prototaxites was a giant fungus , a giant mushroom .
they &apos;re very large .
we found one sample to be able to get into culture .
i actually chased the mycelium , when it stopped producing spores .
the seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .
and hopefully from that i get to learn something .
big questions .
we were taking their biomass , storing them in the basement , growing plants , going around , around , around , trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .
essentially it had done something very simple .
so i went about my business : paragon space development corporation , a little firm i started with people while i was in the biosphere , because i had nothing else to do .
i was there because i was actually modeling the mangrove portion for a carbon credit program , under the u.n .
and over time , essentially what have i been doing ?
jane poynter tells her story of living two years and 20 minutes in biosphere 2 -- an experience that provoked her to explore how we might sustain life in the harshest of environments . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
if you had an acute congestive heart failure , they could bleed a pint of blood from you by opening up an arm vein , giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis and then giving you oxygen by tent .
by the end of the 20th century , it had become more than 15 clinicians for the same typical hospital patient -- specialists , physical therapists , the nurses .
that is to say , they found ways to get all of the different pieces , all of the different components , to come together into a whole .
skill one , find where your failures are .
instead , you can make a recipe for how to have a team that &apos;s prepared for the unexpected .
and we &apos;ve come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize , as individualistic as we want to be , complexity requires group success .
we think perhaps it &apos;s a combination of factors .
i mean , there may be 100 explanations for why haiti is the impoverished nation it is , but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor .
and so , it &apos;s a very dynamic , and i think , historic and exciting community to be involved with .
and bumblebees are what we call eusocial : they &apos;re not truly social , because only the queen is , over winter .
and i think we have lost our connection , and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment .
and so with that , i think that what we can do , if we do this , we can make sure that our future -- our more perfect future -- includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows .
and at one point -- and i had some wine , i have to admit that -- at one point i said , &quot; if there was a contest , i would join . &quot;
okay , i &apos;m not the only one whistling here .
now comes the solo . i propose i do that myself .
the &quot; homo studiosus &quot; -- the studying man .
no one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal , because it was against the order of nature .
so they need a vector -- and this vector , it &apos;s normally an animal .
we have 11 and a half million root apex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area .
they have computing power , they have electrical signals .
one person &apos;s not that unusual .
it &apos;s a prank , but it &apos;s a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell .
there were several other activities .
and in fact , several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us .
and they &apos;re going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs .
cholera was reported in haiti for the first time in over 50 years last october .
i think it &apos;s time for us to apply them to water .
and then , more recently , they really began to do sort of reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were , how they worked and how they might be optimized -- how they might be made better .
and this should be presented factually , straightforwardly , with no particular spin , to all of the children in the country .
no values , just facts about all the world &apos;s religions .
they were clueless .
the question -- was domestication good for sheep ?
anybody know what this is ?
surrendered people obey god &apos;s words , even if it doesn &apos;t make sense . &quot;
you &apos;ve just heard the man .
you could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance .
here &apos;s one : &quot; god deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique .
&quot; you don &apos;t like my interpretation ?
in fact , all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating .
men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expansive listening , and you can transform your relationships .
ten million americans already have this for one reason or another , but really worryingly , 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of american teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse .
sound healing is a wonderful modality .
i wish you sound health .
the materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it .
this is a little piano circuit right in here , and this is an ordinary paintbrush that i smashed it together with .
and then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics , but let &apos;s just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over .
and then what the best part is , we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it .
and i also put this little surprise . when you open the lid of the box , it says , &quot; the world is a construction kit . &quot;
now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be , and all that would be left would be a shadow .
the light from the earth , some of it falls in , but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us .
it shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these helpfully painted curves .
in this case , they &apos;re both wobbling quite a lot .
this animation from my friends at proton studios shows looking at the big bang from the outside .
i mean , in the spirit of rising to ted &apos;s challenge to reignite wonder , we can ask questions , at least for this last minute , that honestly might evade us forever .
the united states has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women .
the story i wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an iranian artist , as an iranian woman artist , as an iranian woman artist living in exile .
for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics .
last year , i finished a film called &quot; women without men . &quot;
the green movement significantly inspired the world .
that implies a lot of trust .
and this guy has to come to the net .
and the one who is happy , even for a slapstick joke , accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself .
and itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion .
let me act compassionately .
the first was the feedback from my cousins .
this is just an excerpt from one of those letters .
they can pause , repeat at their own pace , at their own time .
you &apos;re an 80 percent bicyclist . &quot;
and the idea is , from this we can actually teach everything -- well , everything that can be taught in this type of a framework .
the outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on .
now 100 percent of their time is .
someone from their board came and said , &quot; what would you do if you had carte blanche in a classroom ? &quot;
sk : yeah , it &apos;s ready .
they told me that one of their residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things , and they wondered if she &apos;d gone bonkers or , because she was an old lady , whether she &apos;d had a stroke , or whether she had alzheimer &apos;s .
but it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
she said , &quot; did he have them himself ? &quot;
and they said , &quot; alas , grandpapa , there are no handsome young men . &quot;
and then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear .
there is a film . you &apos;re seeing a film which has nothing to do with you , or that &apos;s how people think about it .
there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons .
&quot; kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
they occasionally interest me , and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks .
edith widder : so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .
it &apos;s a scream for help ; it &apos;s meant to attract attention .
and these are flytrap anemones .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called eye-in-the-sea that uses far red light that &apos;s invisible to most animals , so it &apos;s unobtrusive .
but if it had been following the odor plume , it would have come in from the other direction .
thank you .
so this is a transection through blood .
so it &apos;s thrown out repeatedly in these loops and copied one section at a time , creating two new dna molecules .
one set of dna goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of dna -- identical copies of dna .
it &apos;s also an attention sensing system .
particularly you on the youngsters &apos; side , on this path you &apos;ve chosen , to go as far as you can .
i &apos;ll now proceed quickly , and before else , to a subject that is both a vital asset and a potential barrier to a scientific career .
consider the following principle , which i will modestly call wilson &apos;s principle number one : it is far easier for scientists including medical researchers , to require needed collaboration in mathematics and statistics than it is for mathematicians and statisticians to find scientists able to make use of their equations .
the answer deserves to be stated as principle number four .
i &apos;m the one with the blond hair .
well , what you do is , you test in animals , you test in test tubes , but there &apos;s this notion of going from the bench to the bedside , and in order to get from the bench , the lab , to the bedside , to the patients , you &apos;ve got to get the drug tested .
let &apos;s see if we can use all the tricks of the trade to figure out how to make these drugs work as financial assets ?
we talked to people who have developed drugs .
and so we started thinking about all the different things that could go wrong .
here is the old story -- we &apos;ve already heard a little bit about it : biology is war in which only the fiercest survive ; businesses and nations succeed only by defeating , destroying and dominating competition ; politics is about your side winning at all costs .
not created by the printing press , but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy .
yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students , a significant percentage would reject any offer that &apos;s not close to 50 / 50 .
commerce is ancient . markets are very old . capitalism is fairly recent ; socialism emerged as a reaction to that .
is an apollo project of cooperation possible ?
this wonderful one which i don &apos;t have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories , those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs .
all right . i &apos;m hitting it . i &apos;m punching play .
so , this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the earth .
and he came one day back to campus .
this other condition was inspired by david , my student .
what happened ?
and everybody raised their hand .
and in the third condition , the experimenter got the sheet of paper and directly put it into a shredder .
the next part i want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
now i think a little bit like the ikea effect , by getting people to work harder , they actually got them to love what they &apos;re doing to a higher degree .
why ? because now the builders loved it even more .
karl marx , on the other hand , said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing .
in a country of only seven million people , one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders , their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields .
and he didn &apos;t speak vietnamese .
sophal ear : escaping the khmer rouge
after a counseling session , a woman said to me , &quot; because you have felt me , i can feel myself again , and i want to participate again in my family life . &quot;
but , of course , i needed help and funds .
so this makes us very happy , because now we also have some evidence that this is working .
we love back-of-envelope calculations .
it &apos;s as if we &apos;ve all got 125 light bulbs on all the time , 125 kilowatt-hours per day per person is the energy consumption of the u.k .
those are lines of equal power consumption per unit area , which i measure in watts per square meter .
but i &apos;m also pro-arithmetic .
so that &apos;s some supply side options .
that &apos;s not sad , that &apos;s good , but the sad truth is , it &apos;ll only get about 25 percent of the leakiness of your building , if you do these things , which are good ideas .
how much land mass would renewables need to power a nation like the uk ? an entire country &apos;s worth . in this pragmatic talk , david mackay tours the basic mathematics that show worrying limitations on our sustainable energy options and explains why we should pursue them anyway . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
after all this time here , music is life .
the child becomes a role model for both his parents , and this is very important for a poor child .
we are going live to caracas to hear maestro abreu &apos;s ted prize wish .
well , the one advantage is that you don &apos;t have to pick them up , and people don &apos;t realize how important that is -- not having to pick up your fingers to use them .
so it &apos;s not simply looking at the quality or , if you will , the luxury of that interface , but it &apos;s actually looking at the idea of presenting things that previously couldn &apos;t be presented before .
this is another example of a page with glossary words highlighted in red .
and it really meant something to the child .
and when somebody gets up , in fact , to go answer a phone or use a bathroom or something , the empty seat becomes , if you will , that person . and you point frequently to the empty seat and you say , &quot; he or she wouldn &apos;t agree , &quot; and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial .
all right ? very big differences between the way i answered the phone the three times .
we have now lived with 1,000 elderly households in 20 countries over the last 10 years .
a retired school teacher , there she is with a social security administrator .
when intel does surveys all around the world and we say , &quot; quick response : healthcare . &quot;
classic . hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior .
and most often we can do two interventions , fix the meds mix .
it doesn &apos;t matter how we finance healthcare .
this is what someone that specializes in malware and hacking looks like .
turns out that &apos;s not cool .
which i &apos;ve covered in coffee , and i ask the receptionist to plug in this usb key and print me a new one .
it creates some very serious alerts .
we used google .
so i ran a little scan .
you see , technology &apos;s changing at a staggering rate , and that 250,000 pieces of malware won &apos;t stay the same for long .
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things .
the theme of this story is building a dinosaur , and so we come to that part of &quot; jurassic park . &quot;
now it wasn &apos;t dna ; she didn &apos;t find dna .
and try and try , we could not find dna , but she did find evidence of proteins .
&quot; the chicken is not . &quot;
and now they &apos;re making glow-rabbits and glow-all-sorts-of-things .
if you look at dinosaur hands , a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it .
jack horner : building a dinosaur from a chicken
but that black line shows what a food supply should be in a country if they allow for a good , stable , secure , nutritional diet for every person in that country .
unfortunately , our beasts are inefficient animals , and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat , so we &apos;ve lost those two , and we &apos;ve only kept this one in meat and dairy products .
parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications , tomatoes in tenerife , oranges in florida , bananas in ecuador , where i visited last year , all being discarded . this is one day &apos;s waste from one banana plantation in ecuador .
it &apos;s a living organism , cut the slice off , stuck it in a vase of water , it was all right for another two weeks after this .
secrets . i &apos;m using powerpoint this year just because , you know , i &apos;m into the ted thing .
this is from their actual book .
i go to chrysokeras .
so , i look to you , fellow member of the earth community .
there is obviously einstein , niels bohr , de fermat &apos;s last theorem , and i &apos;m not sure whether that &apos;s james coburn or richard harris .
and you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other .
that guy is rockin &apos; .
descartes .
if fibonacci had been on paxil , that would be the fibonacci series .
i knew those two were related .
am i the only one that sees this ?
so , this book that i have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in 1982 .
so the fact is that there &apos;s a lot of bad guys on the internet these days , and so we dealt with that by making walled communities , secure subnetworks , vpns , little things that aren &apos;t really the internet but are made out of the same building blocks , but we &apos;re still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust .
and i think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it &apos;s actually kind of fragile .
there is no plan b right now .
these virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world .
the second issue : your country could be under cyberattack with entire regions plunged into total darkness , and you may not even know who &apos;s attacking you .
but in doing so , they also add their own risk of triggering a conflict -- as we &apos;ve just seen , a very important risk -- and a risk we may have to confront with a collective security solution which includes all of us : european allies , nato members , our american friends and allies , our other western allies , and maybe , by forcing their hand a little , our russian and chinese partners .
i saw forests and meadows .
i love to draw the deep sea fish , because they are so ugly , but beautiful in their own way .
could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose ?
this next one here , i did a story on the census of marine life .
it was on shark finning , and i felt really strongly about this issue .

in tahltan territory alone , there are 41 major industrial proposals , some with great promise , some of great concern .
you sir , that &apos;s three , and anybody on this side here ?
audience : 23 .
audience : 321 .
does yours go higher ?
for my next number -- while i mentally recharge my batteries , i have one more question for the audience .
audience : may . may what ?
good , thank you very much .
while i explain something else -- -- i know , that you can use , right ?
i &apos;m delighted to be here .
no , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
but what i &apos;ve just made -- and i &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
i take lunch hour .
and all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
but , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink -- we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to -- not bad . pretty good .
i go to a place where a dowel splits off .
there &apos;s a new industry in town , a 22 billion-dollar , 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry : that of personal storage .
we need to think before we buy .
maybe a little more time ? &quot;
and from out of stage left comes this wild , male polar bear , with a predatory gaze .
and this image is , for humans , the beginning point of play .
so play is practical , and it &apos;s very important .
we don &apos;t know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain , because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play .
this took a long time -- i had to get homer down and put him through the fmri and the spect and multiple eegs , but as a couch potato , his brain has shrunk .
this is a book written by a consummate player by the name of kevin carroll .
and one of their projects was to see what makes meetings boring , and to try and do something about it .
and its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain .
so yeah , we &apos;re transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for .
this is made from three ingredients : beets , barley , corn , and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat , looks and tastes like hamburger meat , and not only that , but it &apos;s basically removing the cow from the equation .
so developing nations and first-world nations , imagine if you could take these wild plants and consume them , food miles would basically turn into food feet .
one reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half .
where &apos;s art ? i got productivity . i got sports .
and i came across this fantastic research by wolfgang köhler , the so-called father of gestalt psychology , from 1927 , who submitted to an audience like yourselves the following two shapes .
and in this project we &apos;ve developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles .
there is just a little test screen that shows that it &apos;s working .
and at the same time , it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar psycho-social gaze behaviors .

when they sample from animals , they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals -- the ones that are actually being hunted .
bush meat is one of the central crises , which is occurring in our population right now , in humanity , on this planet .
no comment .
i &apos;m a storyteller .
i come from a conventional , middle-class nigerian family .
my roommate had a single story of africa : a single story of catastrophe .
but i must quickly add that i too am just as guilty in the question of the single story .
i had read tyler and updike and steinbeck and gaitskill .
what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls &quot; a balance of stories . &quot;
the american writer alice walker wrote this about her southern relatives who had moved to the north .
the results were quite extraordinary .
these are , of course , not the only insights i could share , but i hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them , why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on .
but just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and ceo &apos;s , but also shop-girls -- yeah .
prevention is good , and i &apos;m doing the things that you can do to prevent alzheimer &apos;s .
and i &apos;m teaching myself to knit , which so far i can knit a blob .
so how would you run a whole country without oil ?
in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic &quot; batteries not included . &quot;
what is the cost of that battery ?
in europe where taxes are in place , that &apos;s the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel .
when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish .
hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery .
in other words at some point when we &apos;ve recovered we go up to the peak .
the indians don &apos;t even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three gallons every time .
these are perfect matches to one another .
and there was an argument . should we stop using slaves ?
the war is so worrying at present , with court cases coming up in one state after another , that i felt i had to say something about it .
now , the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things .
&quot; everybody gets absolutely frantic about it , because you &apos;re not allowed to say these things , yet when you look at it rationally , there is no reason why those ideas shouldn &apos;t be as open to debate as any other , except that we &apos;ve agreed somehow between us that they shouldn &apos;t be . &quot; and that &apos;s the end of the quote from douglas .
democrats as well as republicans parade their religiousness if they want to get elected . both parties invoke &quot; one nation under god . &quot;
mensa , as you know , is an international organization for people with very high iq .
there should be a snowball effect , a positive feedback , such that the more names we have , the more we get .
hence the phrase , &quot; tooth fairy agnostic . &quot;
and this is because the scientific worldview is so much more exciting , more poetic , more filled with sheer wonder than anything in the poverty-stricken arsenals of the religious imagination .
starting with newspapers , what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information , knowledge and culture , which led to a stark bifurcation between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital , just like any other industrial organization -- and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce .
now , if you have a little girl , and she goes and writes to -- well , not so little , medium little -- tries to do research on barbie .
but what we &apos;re seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange .
instead of building well-behaved appliances -- things that you know what they &apos;ll do in advance -- you begin to build more open tools . there &apos;s a new set of values , a new set of things people value .
this is the africa that is changing , that chris alluded to .
all the time when they talk about it you immediately think about africa .
having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury .
that smoothened out . we were able to save , just before i left , 27 billion dollars . whereas -- and this went to our reserves -- when i arrived in 2003 , we had seven billion dollars in reserves .
we are doing the same with the insurance sector .
and this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year .
but he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to 100 percent , and that is a severe flu pandemic .
this worked well for most pathogens , somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu , but not at all for hiv , for which humans have no natural immunity .
when these mutate , they change their shape , and the antibodies don &apos;t know what they &apos;re looking at anymore .
for the first time , we saw an aids vaccine work in humans -- albeit , quite modestly -- and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago .
we talked about before the h and n spikes on the surface of the flu virus .
the system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow .
will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
that &apos;s what europe is doing , so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available , but , going back to what michael specter said , the anti-vaccine crowd didn &apos;t really want that to happen .
al gore knows . it &apos;s basically everything .
if you ask them to reform the economies , they &apos;re not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo .
just add that up , all these leakages .
in fact , what we call our governments are vampire states .
as a matter of fact , we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors .
the extended family system pools its resources together .
now , it is not just this informal sector .
and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed .
huffington post , the washington post , the new york times -- all flirting with personalization in various ways .
what we &apos;re seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones .
i flew on air force two for eight years .
but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in nigeria had already written a story about my speech .
most of these expenditures are also profitable .
once it &apos;s a closed system , you will have legal liability if you do not urge your ceo to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided . the market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this .
so we live on the most fragile , little soap bubble you can imagine , a very sacred soap bubble , but one that is very , very easy to affect .
and one of the really most incredible things , i think , is that there &apos;s nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest .
well , some people say there are oil plumes .
that guide &apos;s entire calendar year is canceled bookings .
i don &apos;t know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills .
they don &apos;t even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated .
it &apos;s like taking somebody out of a burning building , treating them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building , because the oil is still gushing .
so what we really need to do is regain the idea that it &apos;s our government safeguarding our interests and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost .
the gulf oil spill dwarfs comprehension , but we know this much : it &apos;s bad . carl safina scrapes out the facts in this blood-boiling cross-examination , arguing that the consequences will stretch far beyond the gulf -- and many so-called solutions are making the situation worse . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
i think we should say it all together .
and perhaps other aspects of your personal identity -- maybe your personality and your intellect -- maybe they &apos;re also encoded in the connections between your neurons .
they contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter .
and a neuron , well , that &apos;s smaller than brain .
well , neurons , like trees , can grow new branches , and they can lose old ones .
and so the connectome is like bed of the stream ; but the metaphor is richer than that , because it &apos;s true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water , but over long timescales , the water also reshapes the bed of the stream .
can anyone guess : what &apos;s the total length of wires in your brain ?
connectomes will mark a turning point in human history .
you know , this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door , in your closet , and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf .
in addition , you can see from the diagram on the right , the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet .
you sir , come on up .
so you can see here , you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn &apos;t cause any damage .
ks : for our last technology , we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .
zk : this is something that keith and i really enjoy doing .
the problem for us chefs is that it &apos;s so freakin &apos; delicious .
as he said to me , that really pissed the french off .
amazing .
even though they were imprisoned in this garden of eden with figs and everything else .
that &apos;s how i &apos;ve been trained .
&quot; shush , &quot; he says again for the 500th time to me .
they stop . they mate with his domesticated geese , and his flock continues .
and he says , &quot; no . &quot;
what do you think of foie gras that 99.99999 percent of the world eats ?
they invented gavage in a great moment of fear for their lives , and they provided the pharaoh with gavage liver , and the good stuff they kept for themselves .
we can start by looking to farmers like eduardo .
they &apos;ve enriched the lives of billions .
oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day , plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs , raising its total cost to over a sixth of gdp .
don &apos;t worry about dropping it , it &apos;s tougher than titanium .
the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the empire state building -- remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light , but reflect heat .
such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company .
for example , our over-centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy-shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack .
now our team at rmi helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives , with some more hatching .
this profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life .
so this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out-of-school children , provoking new questions . is development assistance targeting those who most need our help ?
two years ago , on april 8th , 2010 , i called my father .
when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known , i mean , yes , lemon squeezer , toilet brush , toothpick , beautiful toilet seats , and why not -- a toothbrush ?
the big image is our story , our poetry , our romanticism .
because every generation thinks we are the final one .
that means intelligent people are in this angle . that is intelligence .
it &apos;s made of light and shadow .
because the scenario of this civilization -- about love , progress , and things like that -- it &apos;s ok , but there is so many different , other scenarios of other civilizations .
you &apos;ll noticed that almost all of them are minority .
&quot; yes , general . yes , general . &quot;
they come to respect him .
and i &apos;m working at all the energy i have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool , we need head start , we need prenatal care .
now the authorities at ccny were getting tired of me being there .
and i also had this extended network .
we have to make sure they &apos;re ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours , a country that is like no other , a country that amazes me every single day , a country that &apos;s fractious . we &apos;re always arguing with each other .
&quot; no , general . you can &apos;t pay me . i &apos;ve been paid .
they can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas , knowledge , content , designs and product .
u.k.-based interflora monitored twitter for users who were having a bad day , and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers .
and in the egyptian revolution , the revolution 2.0 , everyone has contributed something , small or big . they contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions .
they are living in happiness . they are living in their villas .
to just bring them to justice . &quot;
and when i saw the street on the 25th , i went back and said , &quot; egypt before the 25th is never going to be egypt after the 25th .
and that &apos;s actually what happened . we won .
and you &apos;ll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language .
the first is that the babies are listening intently to us , and they &apos;re taking statistics as they listen to us talk -- they &apos;re taking statistics .
it was like having mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions .
and she &apos;s listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears .
what i am trying to do is i &apos;m trying to bring those two views into one so that my images both speak to the viewer &apos;s heart but also to the viewer &apos;s brain .
and it &apos;s got tiny little particles of metal in it , which makes it magnetic .
so when i open the bottle , the alcohol molecules would spread in the air , and that &apos;s because alcohol is a very volatile substance .
compassion has many faces .
and he walked in , and somebody said something to him , we realized he was deaf , and we looked into the rags , and there was this pair of eyes .
and when i worked in the prison system , it was so clear to me , this : that many of us in this room , and almost all of the men that i worked with on death row , the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered .
why don &apos;t we train our children in compassion ?
he sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg .
suppose you like to square numbers , and frankly , who doesn &apos;t ?
together , they form a one-by-two rectangle .
now , being iranian-american presents its own set of problems , as you know .
he says , &quot; you wait . i &apos;ll be back , &quot; and he walked away .
and a few months before that , there was a white american guy in austin , texas who flew his airplane into the irs building , and i happened to be in austin that day doing a stand-up comedy show .
for example , dubai -- cool place .
&quot; on the third floor , sir . on the third floor . &quot;
so i would like to show you something i &apos;ve been working on .
now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women -- assuming the women they ask told the truth .
our self-deception becomes a positive illusion -- why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures ; why we believe romeo when he says he loves juliet ; and why single notes of music , when played together , become a sonata and conjure up meaning .
however , more often than not , animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they &apos;re treated with a particular drug .
we have three fluidic channels .
but mucus is actually very important .
this could really revolutionize and be a game changer for not only the pharmaceutical industry , but a whole host of different industries , including the cosmetics industry .
this is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab , and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we &apos;re going to require in order to link 10 or more organ chips together .
in 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle .
in the 1970s , the turnover of the red brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars .
and what i discovered is this parallel reality , another international economic system , which runs parallel to our own , which has been created by arms organizations since the end of world war ii .
but also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country .
what does it mean ? that means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have .
in europe , a similar legislation was not introduced .
i didn &apos;t look the part .
so i found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the boat hook to the oars to reinforce it .
i suppose what you mean is : what happens to the boat while i &apos;m sleeping ?
in 2007 , i did a rather involuntary capsize drill three times in 24 hours .
but , as i was approaching the end of my water reserves , luckily , our courses were converging .
if the atlantic was about my inner journey , discovering my own capabilities , maybe the pacific has been about my outer journey , figuring out how i can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world , and to take some of those things that i &apos;ve learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in .
the other point : it &apos;s about taking responsibility .
i get sick . you get sick .
and so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis , experimentation in humans , and informed consent , and you get what we call clinical study , and it &apos;s how we do the vast majority of medical work . it doesn &apos;t really matter if you &apos;re in the north , the south , the east , the west .
we cannot take the information from past trials and put them together to form statistically significant samples .
but more nontrivially , we can get our genotypes done , and although our genotypes aren &apos;t dispositive , they give us clues .
but only five percent of the people wanted out .
so i don &apos;t want to be patient . and the task i &apos;m giving to you is to not be patient . so i &apos;d like you to actually try , when you go home , to get your data .
but any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is , in fact , what you were just talking about , what was going on here , setting up ted , small-scale architecture -- at the present time can &apos;t really happen without a conversation about this , the world trade center , and what &apos;s been going on there , what it means to us .
but i want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that american architecture represents , and that these two things talk about very specifically .
yeah , it &apos;s one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it &apos;s sort of a little movie , without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page , and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it .
so they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune .
this is the work of david rockwell from new york city , whose work you can see out here today .
reed kroloff gives us a new lens for judging new architecture : is it modern , or is it romantic ? look for glorious images from two leading practices -- and a blistering critique of the 9 / 11 planning process .
when i was eight , i wanted to be a marine biologist .
and then this guy , duke &quot; the dumpster &quot; droese , stole my entire shtick .
a few days later , the gym teacher noticed the bruise , and i got sent to the principal &apos;s office .
he was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy , started therapy in eighth grade , had a personality made up of tests and pills , lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs , four fifths suicidal , a tidal wave of antidepressants , and an adolescence being called &quot; popper , &quot; one part because of the pills , 99 parts because of the cruelty .
we are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway , and if in some way we are , don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;ve made a system which is basically a live production machine , a real-time music production machine , and it enables me to , using nothing but my voice , create music in real time as i hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me .
that is literally all my voice being manipulated , and when you get to that point , you have to ask , don &apos;t you , what &apos;s the point ?
okay , here we go .
okay , that still works . okay , good .
in the heart of this ecosystem is the very antithesis of all of these values that we &apos;ve been talking about , and i think these are some of the core values that make us proud to be canadians .
it impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness , where there is 90 percent reduction of key species , like woodland caribou and grizzly bears , and it consumes even more energy , more water , and produces at least as much greenhouse gas .
the incredibly high price of flying food into these remote northern aboriginal communities and the high rate of unemployment makes this an absolute necessity for survival .
this is what &apos;s planned for 2015 .
we have an incredible gift in the boreal , an incredible opportunity to preserve our best defense against global warming , but we could let that slip away .
i , for one , was steeped in these .
he was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases , paintings of everyday objects , the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every indian .
you can violate your expectations about experience . here is an outside water fountain that i created with some friends of mine , but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate . this is something we &apos;re building for , you know , amusement parks and that kind of stuff .
and it &apos;s interesting , by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion , how much stronger the illusions are . any case , i hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness , and if you &apos;re interested in seeing more cool effects , see me outside . i &apos;d be happy to show you lots of things .
it was front page of the new york times a couple months ago .
that &apos;s okay , because check it out -- i have math to prove that it is possible .
for example , i wish i hadn &apos;t worked so hard .
now the concussion didn &apos;t heal properly , and after 30 days i was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches , nausea , vertigo , memory loss , mental fog .
that lasted for more than a year , and it was the hardest year of my life by far .
i have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life .
every single second that you are not sitting still , you are actively improving the health of your heart , and your lungs and brains .
and here &apos;s a secret from the scientific literature for you .
you still have your special mission , your secret mission .
this is some more images of it .
so i had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery .
so what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody ?
it &apos;s a definition really of euclidean space .
thinking , how can that be ? you &apos;re cheating . the lines are curved .
they &apos;ve been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
but through this sort of modality , crochet , other plastic forms of play -- people can be engaged with the most abstract , high-powered , theoretical ideas , the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics , which is where i first learned about hyperbolic space .
one approach , the one we use mainly , is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain , where there &apos;s been a genetic change in a small region of the brain .
i &apos;m not saying i believe this , but this is the standard freudian view .
which you can completely ignore .
so his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal -- he &apos;ll laugh , he &apos;ll cry , so on and so forth -- but the wire from vision to emotions is cut and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor .
the patient &apos;s not delusional .
how do you unlearn the learned paralysis , so you can relieve him of this excruciating , clenching spasm of the phantom arm ?
he said , &quot; oh , i can &apos;t move my phantom . you know that . it &apos;s painful . &quot;
it &apos;s disappeared . &quot;
bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
remember i said it runs in families ?
which one is kiki and which one is buba ?
this species lives only in the congo .
this is kanzi .
they all happened to be captured on film spontaneously , by nhk of japan .
austin , i hear you saying &quot; austin . &quot;
the rock that kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making , but difficult to handle , requiring great skill .
ss : very nice . beautiful , panbanisha .
she wasn &apos;t forced to learn the piano ; she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest .
susan savage-rumbaugh : the gentle genius of bonobos
this picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about 100 patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky .
one idea , incidentally -- and i had this hazard sign to say i &apos;m going to speculate from now on -- is that our big bang was not the only one .
but my theme is that in this century , not only has science changed the world faster than ever , but in new and different ways .
equally untidy office there , as you can see .
over nearly all that immense time , earth &apos;s appearance would have changed very gradually .
speaking as both an astronomer and &quot; a concerned member of the human race , &quot; sir martin rees examines our planet and its future from a cosmic perspective . he urges action to prevent dark consequences from our scientific and technological development .
and so many of the comments were exactly of this type , where people got money and , in fact , it made them antisocial .
people gave money to homeless people .
he said , &quot; i called a girl i wished to love . &quot;
what we see again though is that the specific way that you spend on other people isn &apos;t nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy , which is really quite important .
so we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team .
the implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product and that &apos;s the way to make yourself happier .
they &apos;re today &apos;s iraqi jews .
but washington chose to ignore iran &apos;s outreach , as it would a decade later in afghanistan , and instead moved to intensify iran &apos;s isolation , and it is at this point , around 1993 , &apos; 94 , that iran begins to translate its anti-israeli ideology into operational policy .
this is an analogy that is deliberately aimed at eliminating diplomacy , and when you eliminate diplomacy , you make war inevitable .
that &apos;s the power of taking one piece of data , another piece of data , putting it together , and showing the result .
let &apos;s now spin the world during the same year .
there are two elections every election cycle in lesterland .
really .05 percent ?
now , by corruption i don &apos;t mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of congress .
i can only find cheese . i &apos;m sorry . so there it is .
okay . so how do we do it ?
because if you want to kickstart reform , look , i could kickstart reform at half the price of fixing energy policy , i could give you back a republic .
a republic . a representative democracy .
&quot; sputnik &quot; will soon be released .
there &apos;s a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive -- at least the hypomanic edge part of it .
at ted &apos;s full spectrum auditions , comedian joshua walters , who &apos;s bipolar , walks the line between mental illness and mental &quot; skillness . &quot; in this funny , thought-provoking talk , he asks : what &apos;s the right balance between medicating craziness away and riding the manic edge of creativity and drive ?
now , to get into that , let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately when you hear that we &apos;re talking about synchrony in nature , which is the glorious example of birds that flock together , or fish swimming in organized schools .
and you see that in nature .
but in southeast asia -- places like thailand or malaysia or borneo -- there &apos;s a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies .
it &apos;s this democracy of 10,000 cells that all have to fire in unison for the pacemaker to work correctly .
now , you might think that &apos;s a bizarre idea .
it really started moving sideways and slightly up and down , rather like being on the boat .
think of the people as being like metronomes .
interviewer : right . so if we get on it , we should be able to wobble it , yes ?
and he said , &quot; this genetic resource , &quot; -- and i &apos;ll never forget the words -- &quot; stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine . &quot;
in the united states , in the 1800s -- that &apos;s where we have the best data -- farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100 named varieties of apples .
and there are a couple of answers to that question .
here &apos;s south africa . the same story .
that &apos;s at 78 degrees north .
we &apos;re going up to over a million , and someday we &apos;ll basically have samples -- about 500 seeds -- of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility .
we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future .
this is a very serious research , that you should read the underline .
laptop use to solve overpopulation . and if everything failed , there are some secondary uses .
and i think that the inspiration begins when you &apos;re very young : three-year-olds , up to 12- , 14-year-olds .
the most impressive airplane ever , i believe , was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet .
there &apos;s another one announced just last week .
the military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane was the sr71 . it went a whole life cycle , got too rusty to fly , and was taken out of service . the concorde doubled the speed for airline travel .
and then they flew a few cargo flights , and took it out of service .
i call them the net generation .
he actually moved across the street from us , and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors , and he says , &quot; you &apos;re don tapscott .
it &apos;s not about hooking up online .
sharing is about giving up assets , intellectual property .
but just as the internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government , it also drops the cost of dissent , of rebellion , and even insurrection in ways that people didn &apos;t understand .
you were born , you lived your life and you died .
you can see on the right here , there &apos;s a predator being chased away by the collective power of the birds , and apparently this is a frightening thing if you &apos;re a predator of starlings .
end to end , that would form a line that would circle the earth twice .
but cancers don &apos;t start out like this .
well , i &apos;ve just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy .
the bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy , or surgery , or radiation available .
and here is a growing list of our antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we &apos;re interested in studying .
now , obviously , what i &apos;ve shared with you has some far-ranging implications , even beyond cancer research .
for anyone out here who has cancer , what would you recommend ?
i didn &apos;t invent &quot; bejeweled . &quot; i can &apos;t take credit for that .
it &apos;s like , you know , life is not a very well-written story so we have to hire writers to make movies .
but i couldn &apos;t do that , i realized . i changed the problem .
the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right .
i didn &apos;t come up with the original idea . but this is another way i work as an inventor is to create a sequel .
which way will these fall ?
oh no , our parents are getting alzheimer &apos;s . we better do something .
that &apos;s the corner of the whole thing .
to be a woman means not to be a girl .
but what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way i have never been emboldened .
i &apos;ve seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles .
and that video became the video that went out all over the world after 9 / 11 to show what was going on in afghanistan .
so , seven years ago agnes built the first v-day safe house in narok , kenya , in the masai land .
he said , &quot; you are beautiful . you have grown into a gorgeous woman .
they pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears .
this is not extreme . it &apos;s a girl thing , what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open .
they considered all the usual culprits , and in less than 24 hours , they had selected their suspect : francisco carrillo , a 17-year-old kid who lived about two or three blocks away from where the shooting occurred .
but it happens without awareness such that you don &apos;t , aren &apos;t even cognizant of it occurring .
a good forensic expert also has to be a good educator , a good communicator , and that &apos;s part of the reason why we take the pictures , to show not only where the light sources are , and what we call the spill , the distribution , but also so that it &apos;s easier for the trier of fact to understand the circumstances .
you &apos;ll notice , which was also in my test report , all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side , which means that the shooter &apos;s face would have been photo-occluded . it would have been backlit .
we all have to be very careful .
now , mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down , you measure a longer and longer length .
and as you go through the path , you have to get more and more polite .
so here &apos;s a nankani village in mali .
and finally , well , isn &apos;t this just intuition ?
but here in africa , you &apos;ve got these nonlinear scaling fences .
and so he took me through the initiation ritual for a bamana priest .
and you can go to our website , the applets are all free ; they just run in the browser .
thank you .
at 7 p.m. on a sunday in hidden springs , idaho , where the six members of the starr family are sitting down to the highlight of their week : the family meeting .
sutherland wanted to create a system where ideas didn &apos;t just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom and be adjusted in real time .
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t underestimate the power of doing this . &quot;
it felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn &apos;t light up their world for many years to come .
we &apos;ll make sunday meals more important . &quot;
so one of my daughters threw out , you get five minutes of overreacting time all week .
adaptability is fine , but we also need bedrock .
another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from .
in fact , he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden .
the rounder it is , the more hydrophobic it is , and if it &apos;s really round , it &apos;s superhydrophobic .
we &apos;ve certainly seen that today .
sobule : the old testament god can be so petty . sweeney : don &apos;t get me started on that .
on a dark and stormy night -- really ! -- it was the 10th of july , 1856 .
i have been able , through careful invention , to transmit , with the mere flick of a switch , electricity across the ether .
mt : tesla thought he had the answer .
so when these neurons are in the motor circuit , you get dysfunction in the movement system , and you get things like parkinson &apos;s disease .
so we use electricity to dictate how they fire , and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity .
so here you really have the blues , and the areas in blue are areas that are involved in motivation , in drive and decision-making , and indeed , if you &apos;re severely depressed as these patients were , those are impaired . you lack motivation and drive .
it uses 20 percent of all your -- even though it only weighs two percent -- it uses 10 times more glucose than it should based on its weight .
welcome . if i could have the first slide , please ?
what we discovered was that two- , four- , six- and eight-legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move .
so it &apos;s a very different design . however , what &apos;s changing , what &apos;s really exciting -- and i &apos;ll show you some of that next -- is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics of nature , then nature really can become a much more useful teacher .
it didn &apos;t decrease its preferred speed at all .
like if we had a piece of tape now , we &apos;d peel it this way .
what does the animal do ? the animal has weird toes .
we also presented to nike even .
the ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
we don &apos;t live in the world our mothers lived in , our grandmothers lived in , where career choices for women were so limited .
how do we make this different ?
and then he had these two women who were traveling with him who were pretty senior in his department , and i kind of said to them , &quot; sit at the table . come on , sit at the table , &quot; and they sat on the side of the room .
why does this matter ?
and i &apos;m about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me , but i think important .
studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate .
don &apos;t make decisions too far in advance , particularly ones you &apos;re not even conscious you &apos;re making .
it goes all the way back to aristotle .
they would get dentures , and if you got dentures , you weren &apos;t going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob , you &apos;ll eat mush for the rest of your life .
now here &apos;s what does work : personalized information works .
we should take our foot off the pedal right now , and generally we do . these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down .
they went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal , works for our food , actually helps people understand what &apos;s in their food .
the after takes what was four pages -- that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that &apos;s just the general blood work .
then we use the information that &apos;s already in the lab report .
anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions : can i have my results ?
and that tool is very simply , as chris suggested , looking at us and the world from the plants &apos; or the animals &apos; point of view .
and that &apos;s when i got the idea , which was , &quot; well , what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us ? &quot;
as soon as you start seeing things from the plant &apos;s point of view or the animal &apos;s point of view , you realize that the real literary conceit is that -- is the idea that nature is opposed to culture , the idea that consciousness is everything -- and that &apos;s another very important thing it does .
and you will see , the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we &apos;ve decided ethanol is going to help us .
and the reason he &apos;s waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day , those larvae will hatch and he &apos;ll have a huge fly problem .
it &apos;s a remarkably hopeful thing to do .
that was the computer we knew .
and then the browser appeared . the browser was great , but the browser was very primitive , very narrow bandwidth .
&quot; free &quot; is a great word . you can serve it almost any way .
there &apos;s a shift .
so they &apos;d go to an antique shop , and they &apos;d look at this cup , and they &apos;d say , &quot; tell us about this cup . &quot;
and so today , leaders are faced with how to lead differently , i believe .
leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy .
and so , sort of , the crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game dynamics , really interesting things , that , if you use consciously , you can use to influence behavior , both for good , for bad , for in-between .
it &apos;s called the appointment dynamic .
you should get points for doing this on time .
why go from an a to an f or a b to a c ?
these progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world .
we can influence behavior .
there &apos;s some in the middle east , the little pockets .
and it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce , or in this case , ketchup .
do we have any ?
larry page : thank you , sergey .
and this was kind of a surprise to me , but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head , which you did by writing them down , that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources .
this is actually our &quot; cult picture . &quot;
it makes content get better , it makes searching work better , when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content .
and so basically , he thought he was dealing with something smart , and of course , you know , we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out , and it didn &apos;t quite work , and we don &apos;t have this feature anymore .
amusing ? yes . desirable ? maybe .
i &apos;m a fully paid-up member of that priesthood , and somewhere in here i have my designer glasses .
they make their own intraocular lenses .
so these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they &apos;re being applied to .
and then ideo and acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns , community outreach strategies , business models , new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water .
&quot; one does not put sugar in green tea . &quot;
it &apos;s called &quot; being true to yourself . &quot;
when , in contrast , two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected , then they may amplify one another &apos;s success by turning choosing into a collective act .
for modern americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated with options than anyone else in the world , choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is .
in other words , choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in america when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it .
even up to a year later , american parents were more likely to express negative emotions , as compared to their french counterparts .
moreover , americans themselves could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative , which has been driving their choices for so long .
and so i asked these two ladies , and the one lady told me , &quot; well , you should definitely wear &apos; ballet slippers . &apos; &quot; &quot; well , what does it look like ? &quot;
well , the three big problems have in common that they are man-made problems but they are controlled by natural forces .
then i started publishing online , and some friends from korea , they started being interested in this , and we made a boat which has a front rudder and a back rudder , so we started interacting with this , and it was slightly better , although it was very small and a bit off balance , but then we thought , what if we have more than two points of control ?
so if you &apos;re looking at the boat from this side , this might remind you of an airplane profile .
less than one week after , this is a team in eindhoven , it &apos;s a school of engineering .
well , good morning .
and i had a happy brush with convergence until , kind of , warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing .
calvin bolster : well , ed , this problem concerns the navy &apos;s viking rocket .
this new computer , built to become the nerve center of a defense network , is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid .
meanwhile , as all of this is happening , by the mid- &apos; 50s , the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely .
and it was rigged , and it became unraveled when this man , charles van doren , was outed after an unnatural winning streak , ending berry &apos;s career .
but for this part of the story , i &apos;d actually like to throw it to america &apos;s leading technology correspondent , john markoff .
hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks , where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture , or piece of text , or data across a file system , and we had no way of explaining it .
once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians .
at stake : the battle for you , the consumer , and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of america .
ph : oh , but then he remembers he works for rupert murdoch .
but i don &apos;t need to tell you this , let &apos;s throw it back to him .
this led me to starting a company called design within reach , a company dealing with simple forms , making good designers available to us , and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well , and it seems to have worked .
you &apos;ve captured it for a moment , and finding this little still life &apos;s like listening to little songs or something : it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure .
havana is a wonderful area .
and i came outside , and the valets for this car service had created , you know , quite a nice little collage of these car keys , and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that i had seen in tokyo .
but the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant , and almost an international model .
even the parts of the airplane had french names .
you should be in the art department . &quot;
and that &apos;s the way , ultimately after some ups and downs , i ended up designing the chair i &apos;m going to show you .
they will sit in them forever .
or you can pull them up where you want them .
and you need it in a different position when you &apos;re upright , then when you &apos;re reclined .
other estimates put that number at roughly double that number of infections .
what they &apos;re very good at doing is hitchhiking , particularly the eggs .
having said that , actually , your best form of protection and my best form of protection is a long-sleeve shirt and a little bit of deet to go with it .
and the second is a phenomenon that males are very , very good at finding females .
we can produce them , in a space a bit more than this red carpet , i can produce about 20 million a week .
in a single year , there are 200-300 million cases of malaria and 50-100 million cases of dengue fever worldwide . so : why haven &apos;t we found a way to effectively kill mosquitos yet ? hadyn parry presents a fascinating solution : genetically engineering male mosquitos to make them sterile , and releasing the insects into the wild , to cut down on disease-carrying species .
while i &apos;m talking i &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : how many places have you lived ?
okay ? almost like the highest in the nation .
he &apos;s a colleague . he allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
but it will also be useful for us .
they would not email you back -- but you &apos;d get an automated reply .
you don &apos;t say a prayer .
several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements : phosphorus , nitrogen and calcium .
speaking of humans , there are currently 7 billion of us on earth .
so , we get phosphorus from mines .
by symbiosis , i mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association which is also called mycorrhiza .
what &apos;s more is that in certain cases , we don &apos;t even need to add phosphorus .
in conclusion , i am a scientist and a dreamer .
so , what i thought i would bring up is another component that needs to be thought of , whenever you think about nature , and that &apos;s basically the invention of generic form in genetic evolution .
the intricacies of scale that come out of that -- you know , in the example of the nose to the face , there &apos;s a fractional part-to-whole idea .
this idea has , kind of , brought me into doing some product design , and it &apos;s because design firms that have connections to architects , like , i &apos;m working with vitra , which is a furniture company , and alessi , which is a houseware company .
so a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern .
thanks very much .
so one of the questions we &apos;ve been asking is , how much of the world is used to grow food , and where is it exactly , and how can we change that into the future , and what does it mean ?
now , a lot you will remember this from your geography classes .
nineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only in the aral sea are now wiped off the face of the earth .
but what &apos;s really important here to remember is that it &apos;s not all bad . it &apos;s not that agriculture &apos;s a bad thing .
we have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between growing food and having a healthy environment work better .
that &apos;s almost the size of south america .
we need to invest in real solutions : incentives for farmers , precision agriculture , new crop varieties , drip irrigation , gray water recycling , better tillage practices , smarter diets .
this is a shopping mall .
so the implications of that are vast , because it means that this is where employment is — 1.8 billion people — and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world , because people are actually able to earn money and live and thrive , as andrew saboru did .
now , are there downsides to that ?
robert neuwirth : the power of the informal economy
diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways .
it causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen , the internal chamber of our intestine , and then that fluid goes the only way it can , which is out the other end .
each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person -- a lot of variation on which natural selection can act .
antibiotic sensitivity was going down .
this shows you the positions of some of these dams .
and all i &apos;m saying is that we need to figure out how they &apos;ll evolve , so that -- we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck , so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go .
we talk with our hands .
well our patients have to use very code-y systems of using just their arm muscles to operate robotic limbs .
so our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation .
and i challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this .
he &apos;s about four or five times as fast with this simple little performance metric .
for 20 years , my goal was to let somebody &#91; be &#93; able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way and at the same time .
it &apos;s about seven pounds , which is probably about what my arm would weigh if i lost it right here .
but my favorite one was just when the hand was open , because i work with kids , and so all the time you &apos;re clapping and singing , so i was able to do that again , which was really good .
so rather than a super strong or super fast arm , we &apos;re making an arm that is -- we &apos;re starting with , the 25th percentile female -- that will have a hand that wraps around , opens all the way , two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow .
she was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she &apos;d received during the trial , or even what the trial had been about .
now , in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable , participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand , and must freely consent to participate in the trial .
if , for any reason , they feel that this might not be possible , then i think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place .
we &apos;re not paying the true environmental costs of our actions .
i thought i was going to study the social behavior of galapagos penguins , but you already know penguins are rare .
but we didn &apos;t even know that that affected the galapagos when i went to study penguins .
but , in fact , when we went to argentina , penguins were often found totally covered in oil .
but we &apos;ve been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go .
and you can see , he &apos;s not trying to bite .
so , they really are pretty amazing creatures .
the problem with this model is that there are some amazing messages that need to be said that aren &apos;t profitable to say .
a heroic effort is a collective effort , number one .
as long as we believe that people , our own neighbors , are selfish , stupid or lazy , then there &apos;s no hope .
now this is important , because border conflicts justify so much of the world &apos;s military-industrial complex .
in fact , the world bank predicts that russia &apos;s population is declining towards about 120 million people and there is another thing that you don &apos;t see on this map .
this is the map of the yuan dynasty , led by kublai khan , the grandson of genghis khan .
another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy .
these are pipeline routes , which emerge from kurdistan , which is an oil-rich region .
it even had an offshoot running to haifa in what is today israel , on the mediterranean sea .
more pipelines means more silk roads , instead of the great game .
i don &apos;t think it does . i think it &apos;s already part of a euro-turkish superpower .
but i believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today is far worse and far more violent .
but at that time , most of the mutant worms are still alive .
and you meet someone you really like , you get to know her .
these hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies .
they hardly get cancer , and when they do it &apos;s not as severe .
so it can &apos;t turn the genes on .
and there are certain forms of the foxo gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100 .
ck : ah , so the kinds of drugs i was talking about would not change the genes , they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity .
they &apos;re more resistant to these kinds of stresses .
we tend to view them -- and the popular press aids and abets this view -- as chemical imbalances in the brain , as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine , serotonin and norepinephrine .
do these organisms even have emotion-like states , or are they just little digital robots ?
and what this quantification showed us is that , upon experiencing a train of these air puffs , the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent , long-lasting , and also appears to be graded .
they flunk out of caltech .
gotcha .
and we found some remarkable differences .
and so we set up another crazy experiment , because we collected the smell of these larvae , put it on pieces of cloth , and then did something very remarkable .
now , on the video , on the video here , i &apos;m going to show you exactly the same thing , except that what i &apos;m showing you on the video happened one hour after i took the tablet .
as the demand for donor organs continues to rise , in large part due to the aging population , the supply has remained relatively constant .
now just about that time , the practice of surgery evolved from big to small , from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures , tiny incisions .
indeed , there is a lot of hype , but also hope that the promise of stem cells will one day provide cures for a whole range of conditions .
while still in a research phase , stem cells may one day herald a quantum leap in the field of cardiology .
we hope to have , our maestro , to have orchestras in all the countries in all americas .
what are they doing right ?
here &apos;s an interesting one .
but here &apos;s a scary one : divorce is contagious .
jenna mccarthy : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
to make progress , we need to break the code .
and second , just as in a radio broadcast , you can communicate with many receivers at once .
and you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect .
these decisions are clearly a reflection of the actor &apos;s policy .
this means that the critic must have spoken in that animal , and that the critic must be contained among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left , but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right .
come to think of it , knowing when you &apos;re wrong without a teacher , or your mother , telling you , is a very hard problem .
we need to invent what i call a personal health system .
and i know you want to look and see if those spots are still there .
and many countries are going to go brickless from the start because they &apos;re never going to be able to afford the mega-medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built .
and this happens to millions of people every year .
the first was quite simple . i finally realized some years ago that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity .
this ted stage and all of the ted stages are often about celebrating innovation and celebrating new technologies , and i &apos;ve done that here today , and i &apos;ve seen amazing things coming from ted speakers , i mean , my gosh , artificial kidneys , even printable kidneys , that are coming .
this is a log scale , so what looks like steady growth is actually an acceleration in real terms .
but there &apos;s a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world .
the next day , it started answering questions with profanities .
people are racing against the machine , and many of them are losing that race .
now , being a biologist , i was very curious about this .
and you can try this in the lobby , and look at the gecko-inspired material .
and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance .
they &apos;re climbing up a wall , or a tree .
now , of course , we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations , so we thought , &quot; oh that &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll put it in a vertical wind tunnel .
so we went , &quot; oh my god , we have to go to the field , and see if it actually does this . &quot;
we &apos;ll look at sea level rise .
you know , from an oceanic perspective , 450 is way too high .
and we &apos;ve got it worked out , and we can say , &quot; yes , co2 is causing the planet to warm up now . &quot;
this is the part of antarctica that we worry about .
this was completely unexpected .
and just so you know , 1982- &apos; 83 , that el nino killed 95 percent of all the corals here in galapagos .
imagine that .
and i chose this one because it &apos;s complicated and messy looking , right .
the main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .
and i always answered , &quot; well , i &apos;d want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for . &quot;
so we &apos;re not forcing people to travel .
but i was looking at this intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out of people just seeing these photographs .
iraq , and then iraq , and then iraq .
but it doesn &apos;t make me believe that we &apos;re in world that can live without war yet .
that &apos;s no sacrifice , that &apos;s revenge !
tzvika : i said , &quot; ok , that &apos;s bat-chen , that &apos;s my daughter .
freedom !
it &apos;s endless what you can imagine , in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience .
jehane noujaim unveils her 2006 prize wish : to bring the world together for one day a year through the power of film .
the moon is kept in orbit , according to these ideas , because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtue of their presence .
he , in fact -- there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim , he read a book , a treatise on swimming -- -- then dove into the ocean .
in detail , for instance , they couldn &apos;t get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory .
it &apos;s built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy , vibrating in different frequencies .
this is a deep question .
it &apos;s a machine that will send particles around a tunnel , opposite directions , near the speed of light .
and you have to tell me which one .
so , color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces , according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect .
we &apos;re very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes , like language .
now , when i tell you , i want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes .
so you see it that way .
are we the only ones that see illusions ?
it looks like they &apos;re going to green flowers .
but we can also do something else . we can also make music with color .
okay . so they are physically the same .
the second important myth to understand -- because we have to destroy these myths , dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them -- the second important myth to understand is the one that says that in fact corruption is only a small problem -- if it is a problem , it &apos;s only a small problem , that in fact it &apos;s only a little 10 or 15 percent , it &apos;s been going on forever , it probably will continue forever , and there &apos;s no point passing any laws , because there &apos;s little we can do about it .
okay ? this is the size of the problem .
but what were they accused of ?
now , the previous two examples i gave were to do with construction sector corruption , okay ?
so i started digging and writing and so and so on , and that work can be found , my personal work can be found at afraraymond.com , which is my name .
that is about three and a half billion u.s. dollars coming out of a small -- we used to be resource-rich -- caribbean country . okay ?
i have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country &apos;s history .
and they &apos;re different .
we make these trade-offs again and again , multiple times a day .
one example would be , people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common .
so we have trouble with the risks that aren &apos;t very common .
if , for example , terrorism almost never happens , it &apos;s really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures .
we get them from religion , from culture , teachers , elders .
we change light bulbs without even thinking about it .
and stakeholders with specific trade-offs will try to influence the decision .
but 80 years , we &apos;re just not good at .
the second , more honest way is to actually fix the model .
it made their feeling of security more match the reality .
now plants are under threat .
we have 120 partner institutions all over the world , in all those countries colored orange .
twenty-five percent of all the world &apos;s plants , by 2020 .
so what happened when the professor left the room ?
i had a question in my mind : would hispanic kids react the same way as the american kids ?
and we need to learn that principle here in the states , because we have a big debt .
mayor giuliani wanted to tear it down .
there &apos;s a point , you can stand here and see buildings by frank gehry , jean nouvel , shigeru ban , neil denari .
we loosely call them &quot; groups . &quot;
now i &apos;m not naive .
but now , as we prepare to talk , we understand how little we know .
most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups , because they were terrorists .
when mandela came out of prison after 27 years of captivity , if he had told his people , &quot; it &apos;s time to take up the arms , it &apos;s time to fight , &quot; he would have been followed .
we could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently , by engaging with civil society .
how are we going to settle and build a bigger &quot; we &quot; to deal with our issues if we don &apos;t improve our skills of communication ?
it &apos;s the kind of thing that i sit up late at night thinking about sometimes -- often at four in the morning .
she &apos;s the leading archaeologist working easter island today .
now , this is the normal way it &apos;s done .
i used to work , also while at microsoft , at a leading restaurant in seattle , so i do a lot of cooking .
after the movie came out , of course , there was a lot of interest in seti .
and there &apos;s some stuff poking out . so , you look at that , and you look up close , and you say , &quot; well , gee , that &apos;s kind of interesting . what are all of these pieces ? &quot;
these days , bits are cheap . unfortunately , that means you &apos;ve got to spend more time sorting through them .
and say , &quot; yeah , you know , i -- this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep , but that &apos;s really what works for me . &quot;
you could certainly tell the difference between a chinese restaurant and a french restaurant by what they had in a larder .
and darwinian evolution is really the core theory .
i kept getting this call from this oncologist named david agus .
so seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time , and suddenly you say , &quot; wow , it &apos;s way more complicated than we thought it was . &quot;
and many people in this audience probably wouldn &apos;t be alive if doctors didn &apos;t do this .
what we really need to get at is the process that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s happening at the level of the proteonomic actions , happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally does ?
there will be many teams like our team that work on this .
february 4th , we posted it on our website . this was before super tuesday .
stage one is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons .
because it is in stage three that many of us move .
this is their lobby .
there was no road map . no one had ever done anything like this before .
why did he do that ? because most people are not at stage five .
we move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe and then , over time , getting them connected .
and they released the first-ever world poll .
but the sound we are greeted with , as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late-afternoon light , recalls to mind a dirty men &apos;s room in the rear of a greek coffee shop .
although they make no claim to architectural beauty , they are , in their perfect temporariness , a delightful alternative to the large-scale structures that might someday take their place .
the relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate .
karen armstrong has told what i think is an iconic story of giving a speech in holland and , after the fact , the word &quot; compassion &quot; was translated as &quot; pity . &quot;
compassion cultivates and practices curiosity .
this is jean vanier .
and this trend of what rachel naomi remen is doing , how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine -- the work fred luskin is doing -- i think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the 21st century -- that science , in fact , is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism .
gandhi , too , was a real flawed human being .
and i had this idea that camp was going to be just like this , but better .
and at the risk of sounding grandiose , it is the world &apos;s loss .
okay , same thing is true in our workplaces .
steve wozniak invented the first apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in hewlett-packard where he was working at the time .
but then we hit the 20th century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality .
but he also loved his congregation , and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi .
that is great .
but what i &apos;d like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often .
they were tough in the sense that , as i grew up , both my mother and father would always say to me , it &apos;s really important that you always remember two things .
that &apos;s year by year . this comes from our friends at gapminder.com .
it is still , in most places , a gray or black box , and it looks the same .
children dress with very colorful , colorful clothes , and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids , in a computer . and i have to tell you that it &apos;s so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids .
and therefore , this is your opportunity to do better than my generation . &quot;
i do believe what chris said . i believe that you &apos;re not an accident .
when the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years , i kind of had my little crisis .
this is not my planet . it wasn &apos;t mine before i was born .
it determines , really , everything in your life .
and that is , when my wife and i got married 30 years ago , we started tithing .
and i &apos;m going , what do i do with this notoriety that the book has brought ?
and i could go five years and never , ever see a homeless person .
he got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do .
and so , i &apos;m talking to the players , because most of the nba teams , nfl teams and all the other teams have done this 40 days of purpose , based on the book .
did you know that god smiles when you be you ?
it &apos;s not going to happen , you know , in one year , but it &apos;s an important , deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children .
i &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this -- why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
so by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits -- and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
so this is a huge practical problem .
augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
and something else happened instead .
what is bioenergy ? bioenergy is not ethanol .
so you take something like this , you burn it , you put it under pressure , and likely as not , you get this . although , again , i stress : we don &apos;t know .
the oil price goes through the floor . that company goes out of business , and then you can bring the oil price back up .
because vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home .
and we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs , these transformational needs for our key employees in the company .
at age 17 , he started asking the kinds of questions that you &apos;d expect of someone with a beginner &apos;s mind .
and yet , of course , that little intangible piece of data doesn &apos;t factor into our gdp calculations .
this is a collection of things that robert kennedy said in that quote .
gdp has been our hammer .
i learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country .
but actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
so if you add rules to play , you have a game .
ao : the puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule .
and the discussion is , who cares ? right ?
it &apos;s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
right ? we normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . when he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
and what we don &apos;t often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products .
and so we kind of have this kind of moral feel-good moment .
and so we &apos;re on one planet , and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems .
it turns out that our other species has figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things that we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well .
and yet , as a movement that has to broaden its constituency , that has to grow , that has to reach out beyond our natural comfort zone , one of the challenges to the success of this movement , of getting rid of things like plastic and helping the economy shift , is people look at our movement with some suspicion .
for a kid at that age , this was like infinite speed , disappearing , and i was very inspired by that .
if we can get rid of that , then the highways will now be useful to you , as contrasted by what &apos;s happening in many parts of the world today .
well , you can &apos;t right now take off from your home because it &apos;s too noisy .
if that single-stability system , that brain that flies that aircraft , fails , or if the engine fails , that vehicle crashes . there is no option to that .
there won &apos;t be a third chance .
they thought , &quot; who would use it if you didn &apos;t ? &quot;
basically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb at a distance of about two meters .
it stays within either what we call the source , or within the device .
it will cause one to get created on the other side .
and those of you that have an iphone recognize the green center .
first , don &apos;t become a cannibal .
all right , so for some of you , this may be really , really out there .
and the saying goes , we came from dust and will return to dust .
so we did .
we take the kids to australia .
we never got the chance to say goodbye .
the family won &apos;t listen to reason .
maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go .
the overwhelming presence of hope isn &apos;t denial .
well , we collect data from satellites , from airplanes , from ground vehicles , from people .
we have to bundle adjust them . find tie points .
microsoft &apos;s stephen lawler gives a whirlwind tour of virtual earth , moving up , down and through its hyper-real cityscapes with dazzlingly fluidity , a remarkable feat that requires staggering amounts of data to bring into focus .
and the system is contained . what do i mean by that ?
the larger column that we then installed in san francisco in the installed system .
well , that &apos;s less than one percent of the surface area of the bay .
call it &quot; fuel without fossils &quot; : jonathan trent is working on a plan to grow new biofuel by farming micro-algae in floating offshore pods that eat wastewater from cities . hear his team &apos;s bold vision for project omega and how it might power the future .
you cannot be constrained by the public &apos;s opinion .
if you know nothing about china and the soviet union other than the fact about their telephones , you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades .
that &apos;s because the two countries have about the same population size .
it turns out even during the cultural revolution , china out-perfomed india in terms of gdp growth by an average of about 2.2 percent every year in terms of per capita gdp .
it &apos;s very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern .
in terms of the political changes , they have introduced village elections .
which country has the growth momentum ?
you would be sharper and more alert .
a wonderful guy named timothy prestero , who has a company called ... an organization called design that matters .
another is newton and the apple , when newton was at cambridge .
they have a feeling that there &apos;s an interesting problem , but they don &apos;t quite have the tools yet to discover them .
and i &apos;ll leave you with this story , which i think captures a lot of these values , and it &apos;s just wonderful kind of tale of innovation and how it happens in unlikely ways .
we could probably calculate the speed that the satellite is traveling , if we do a little basic math here using the doppler effect . &quot;
i mean , here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch , this little passion that had developed , then they thought they were fighting the cold war , and then it turns out they &apos;re just helping somebody find a soy latte .
so we &apos;re living in the age of the global plutocracy , but we &apos;ve been slow to notice it .
the latest poster boy for this phenomenon is david karp .
and that &apos;s no mere hypothetical example .
for all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets , it &apos;s also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed western economies .
look , i had second thoughts , really , about whether i could talk about this to such a vital and alive audience as you guys .
i was called down to the ward to see him .
so a colleague of mine from nursing called lisa shaw and i went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die .
sorry , i just feel such a , i feel such a cassandra here .
and i have one small idea , and one big idea about what could happen .
i think most people don &apos;t want to be dead , but i do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds .
and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called &quot; the hot zone . &quot; it was all about the outbreak of the ebola virus .
at first when i heard of cancer stem cells , i didn &apos;t really know how to put the two together . i &apos;d heard of stem cells , and i &apos;d heard of them as the panacea of the future -- the therapy of many diseases to come in the future , perhaps .
and while i was reading all these articles about cancer , it seemed that the articles -- a lot of them -- focused on , you know , the genetics of breast cancer , and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer -- tracking the cancer through the body , tracing where it is , where it goes .
and you think , the more highways there are in a tissue , the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases .
maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells , and this is why it seems as if it is so rare .
and the grandmother had never let any westerners ever see her .
and korea was probably the place i found to be the worst for these kids .
the end of the week came and my translator came back , because i &apos;d asked her to come back , so i could formally thank the grandmother and hyun-sook .
and my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her .
and she said , &quot; he says he knows who you are , what do you want ? &quot;
and i could be wrong , i don &apos;t know , but i wish you would come tomorrow . &quot;
and so i suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet father keene , to find out how the adoption process worked .
this is a woman who is now working at the orphanage , whose son had been adopted .
we &apos;re lying in bed , and gene and i are talking about how cool we are .
we &apos;re all choking , and there &apos;s smoke pouring through the vents , under the doors . there &apos;s people screaming .
and there &apos;s this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes in all this , and people were shouting in korean .
this is father keene with natasha at the bus stop .
people were always telling natasha how much she looks like her mother , gail .
and there &apos;s evan .
what about the idea of the plurality of the worlds , about life on other planets ?
we learn about its orbit , the period of its orbit and so on .
we were still back where copernicus was .
we know and expect that we &apos;ll see that .
so that &apos;s what we are building from the left side of the river .
life on earth is the size of the earth .
and if we are to be stewards of our planet earth and its biosphere , we &apos;d better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it .
then , uganda started to turn back , whereas zimbabwe skyrocketed , and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequency .
not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it .
so , this is the difference within tanzania .
it could be some virus types .
past and future billions .
so why ?
within an incredibly short period of time , people living in the german democratic republic produced trabants , the trabbi , one of the world &apos;s worst ever cars , while people in the west produced the mercedes benz .
they &apos;re just icons ; you click on them .
property rights : it &apos;s not the democracy , folks ; it &apos;s having the rule of law based on private property rights .
very few indians today wish that india had gone down mahatma gandhi &apos;s road .
because it &apos;s on your watch that this is happening .
that &apos;s not the way history works .
and it &apos;s a crisis that has its structural facet -- it &apos;s partly to do with demographics .
all spiders make silk at some point in their life .
there &apos;s the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web .
now , it &apos;s really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body .
if you look right here at the two red arrows , they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus .
thank you .
flickr is a photo-sharing service that allows people to take photos , upload them , share them over the web and so forth .
you can &apos;t hire everyone in a company , right ?
and worst of all , that figure at the bottom , approximately ten photos per photographer , is a lie .
this is the math underlying the 80 / 20 rule . right ?
and the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n .
the inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
and the answer to that question is , it doesn &apos;t matter , because that &apos;s not the right question .
now , this is the part of the talk where i tell you what &apos;s going to come as a result of all of this , but i &apos;m running out of time , which is good , because i don &apos;t know .
with whole grain bread , you have other obstacles .
okay , we &apos;re going to start with the first stage .
it can be in a basket . it can be in a loaf pan , but we pan it .
but i want to go back now and revisit these steps , and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation , because i really believe that all things can be understood -- and this is not my own idea . this goes back to the scholastics and to the ancients -- that all things can be understood on four levels : the literal , the metaphoric or poetic level , the political or ethical level .
the first transformation -- and , by the way , the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else .
a subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time -- it &apos;s all about a balancing act between time , temperature and ingredients . that &apos;s the art of baking .
and what we &apos;re going to attempt to do with this bread here , again , is to use , in addition to everything we talked about , this bread we &apos;re going to call &quot; spent grain bread &quot; because , as you know , bread-making is very similar to beer-making .
no , it &apos;s not — oh , why thank you .
and so forth .
i mean , there &apos;s not any traditional notation .
i was a bit mischievous . in fact , to make it more interesting , i put a space right in here , and this is the actual title of the piece .
in the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
and the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
well it turns out that the babies , the new caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
so they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
and using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
same as the other side .
well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
so what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
to produce these animations , an animator at a studio has to anticipate what &apos;s going to happen in the actual game , and then has to animate that particular sequence .
so , we simulated that as well , and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk .
what you see here is the character standing there , and there &apos;s an obstacle that we put in its way .
so that &apos;s what you see here .
we just did that for a laugh , just to see what happens .
this is something i just got last night from an animation studio in london , who are using our software and experimenting with it right now .
now , we &apos;ve just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves , &quot; can we do that ourselves as well ? &quot;
that &apos;s one project we &apos;re particularly excited about , and that &apos;s going to start next month .
incredible . that was really incredible .
shake it , and you have a heterosexual couple .
it &apos;s a children &apos;s book about indian independence -- very patriotic .
it &apos;s not enough your software crashed my mac and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my roms ! now the mac makes the sounds of silence .
this is the original mac operating system .
software is subject to another primal force : the mandate to release more and more versions .
i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s there !
so why is united states in the &quot; u &quot; s ?
the bill gates song !
so is there any hope ? the screens are getting smaller .
the lesson was : simplicity sells .
and conversely , if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- i say , &quot; piss off . &quot;
and so very simple things -- off-the-shelf technologies that we could easily find on the then-early web -- would clearly make a huge difference to that problem .
we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal .
but i wanted to share with you three areas that i &apos;m particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that i was talking about in the wired article .
and i want to give you a specific example of a new material that was discovered 15 years ago .
the whole green dream -- because it can be profitable .
and the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of 1,000 in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact .
and what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information .
and i &apos;m a product of that generation , like so many other of my peers .
certainly , in the last 15 years , we &apos;ve seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed , and just last month , a couple of weeks ago , a planet in the size-class of earth has actually been found .
how do you know it when you find it ?
well , this is what we apply to our work .
it &apos;s 115 miles of mapped passage , it &apos;s pristine , it has no natural opening and it &apos;s a gigantic biological , geo-microbiological laboratory .
these are all over the planet mars , and we &apos;re busy cataloguing them now .
and perhaps it &apos;s time we started to explore those , in the context of future mars and the moon exploration .
well , bad news : you should have kept your mouth shut , because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it .
after hitting on a brilliant new life plan , our first instinct is to tell someone , but derek sivers says it &apos;s better to keep goals secret . he presents research stretching as far back as the 1920s to show why people who talk about their ambitions may be less likely to achieve them .
and it became a world famous manuscript .
the top half is elmer &apos;s wood glue .
the prayer book is dark in both images and it comes out dark .
now we weren &apos;t actually going to put archimedes in that beam .
this was a bad idea , because philip of macedon had a son called alexander the great , and they lost the battle of chaeronea .
and institutions can learn from this .
why don &apos;t we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance of the internet .
it may come from wagyu cattle , but it &apos;s not from the original , appalachian hyogo prefecture in japan .
they did give me a tour , though .
a recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from japan -- you &apos;ll start to notice .
not only is it a technological leap forward , but i really do believe it &apos;s a bit of a cultural leap forward .
and cheval blanc is kind of an unusual wine for bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the cabernet franc grape .
but what was unexpected was that these researchers did mri brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine , and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more -- their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag .
but we &apos;re here for the good news , and the good news is that i think we can explore why this very real human effort , this very intense generation of value , is occurring .
and by this , i mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the rate , the nature , the type , the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort .
there &apos;s 100 percent up here .
and the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways .
but if you can model things for people , if you can give things to people that they can manipulate and play with and where the feedback comes , then they can learn a lesson , they can see , they can move on , they can understand .
and in this video game , there were two really big dragons , and you had to team up to kill them -- 42 people , up to 42 to kill these big dragons .
but again , those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal , to take the data , to take the observations , of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement .
so to address this problem , i put together a team of international researchers in switzerland , denmark and the u.k .
and as a final parting thought , on behalf of future archeologists , i would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth .
we did this bag for haiti , and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in haiti .
unfortunately , in our agricultural system , we haven &apos;t done a good job in the last three decades of exporting those technologies around the world .
and instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate , it &apos;s really important to look at them as one system .
understanding how to produce protein in a way that &apos;s healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers .
we actually created an artificial schism between creation and execution , as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create .
this is the modus operandi that we have today .
the second issue is a nuance of the first .
that &apos;s a lot for a client to commit to before you actually see the fruition of the concept .
and some of the seats need to actually change their direction , and change their rake , to allow that to happen .
now , if i &apos;ll take you through -- this is an early concept sketch -- take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together .
as i said , this can be done with only two people , and with a minimum amount of time .
and recently i &apos;ve been much more interested in collecting stories from reality -- so , real stories .
this is , then , how they &apos;re presented .
&quot; i can feel my cancer grow . &quot;
when i was sleeping , with a tripod and a timer .
introduction of red down here , when whales are being cut up .
this is the muktuk , or the blubber , all lined up for community distribution .
a 17-year-old student . her wish was to have been born a boy .
her wish was to marry someone with a car .
and she said , &quot; well , you know , i think i &apos;d kind of like to live my whole life in the cave . &quot;
so if any of you have any bhutan travel plans in the near future , you can go check these out . here are some images from that .
if you know anything about anatomy , that &apos;s not a good thing to get cut , and everything , of course , on the way up , and then — i still had my hands up — he pulled it out and went for my neck , and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck , and i got one straight right punch and knocked the middle guy out .
it &apos;s like i gave you a new car and you &apos;re complaining about not finding parking .
casual speech is something quite different .
and that &apos;s where texting comes in .
so julie says , &quot; i just sent you an email . &quot;
now that seems kind of mundane , but think about how in real life , if we &apos;re having a conversation and we want to change the topic , there are ways of doing it gracefully .
increasing evidence is that being bilingual is cognitively beneficial .
thank you .
we faced rwanda ; we faced bosnia , and then we rediscovered our confidence .
and these troops that we brought in -- it &apos;s a great picture of david beckham there on the sub-machine gun -- made the situation worse , not better .
and mullah mustafa -- he &apos;s the man with the pen and paper -- explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph , nadir shah had bet him that he couldn &apos;t hit me .
or in 2010 , the u.k. foreign secretary , david miliband , who said that at last we would deliver the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
secondly , we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals .
because if what we &apos;re interested in is terrorism , pakistan is far more important than afghanistan .
just briefly , what &apos;s your take on the current events there and the intervention ?
so , the technology that i want to talk about is for the third world , for the developing world , but it has , i think , much broader application , because information is so important in the healthcare system .
now , how simple can you make the production ?
so , it works very well there , but it doesn &apos;t work very well when you need more quantitative information .
do they have a common cold ?
you don &apos;t have to send out a doctor , you send out somebody who can just take the sample , and in the clinic either a doctor , or ideally a computer in this case , does the analysis .
and in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that .
it costs 50 dollars . we can probably make it for 50 cents , if we put our mind to it .
no big surprise , obama couldn &apos;t do better than kerry there .
in louisiana , about one in five white voters said , &quot; yes , one of the big reasons why i voted against barack obama is because he was an african-american . &quot;
we &apos;re going to drill down a little bit more now , into something called the general social survey .
it &apos;s about who you live with .
a few months ago , a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where i live , and she was brought in confused .
and a woman comes in with a child , and conan doyle describes the following exchange .
he began to tap on the chests of his patients , on their abdomens .
i &apos;ve often wondered , what would fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era , in the year 2011 ?
it had a beautiful facility , giant atrium , valet parking , a piano that played itself , a concierge that took you around from here to there .
and i began my ritual .
and if you shortchange that ritual by not undressing the patient , by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown , by not doing a complete exam , you have bypassed on the opportunity to seal the patient-physician relationship .
i will never abandon you .
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
and in all cases we have to ask -- what &apos;s the more likely explanation ?
in the case of galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn .
faces are important for us socially .
here &apos;s the virgin mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
it &apos;s a love story -- she &apos;s sort of the norah jones of the u.k. -- about how she much loves her guy , and compared to nine million bicycles , and so forth .
it &apos;s not only preventable ; it &apos;s actually reversible . and for the last almost 29 years , we &apos;ve been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle , using these very high-tech , expensive , state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography , before and after a year , and cardiac pet scans .
imagine : many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm .
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
nathan was the number two person at the san francisco spca .
and if i can just get enough money to tell enough people , i &apos;ll sell enough . &quot;
but they always stop and take a picture .
that most movements , most leadership that we &apos;re doing is about finding a group that &apos;s disconnected but already has a yearning -- not persuading people to want something they don &apos;t have yet .
and around and around and around it goes .
they want to be missed when they &apos;re gone .
however , undeterred due to my teenage optimism -- — i went online to a teenager &apos;s two best friends , google and wikipedia .
then , suddenly , a thought occurred that kind of put a blemish on my amazing plan here .
and so in the next two to five years , this sensor could potentially lift for pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal 5.5 percent to close to 100 percent , and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer .
where i work , in the arab region , people are busy taking up western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally western , nor are they traditionally islamic .
another character called jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions .
and when you love , how does it feel ?
how do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
i look at this person -- by the way , in desire people rarely talk about it , when we are blended into one , five centimeters from each other . i don &apos;t know in inches how much that is .
is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union ?
and then i began to ask the reverse question .
and i will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection , and i won &apos;t know how to leave you in order to go play , in order to go experience pleasure , in order to discover , to enter inside myself .
it &apos;s pretty much like the moon . it has intermittent eclipses .
and so the bands at tootsie &apos;s or at cbgb &apos;s had to play loud enough -- the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down , shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing .
it &apos;s not as big as a gothic cathedral , so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate .
and they &apos;re a lot more reverberant than la scala .
&#91; live music &#93; doesn &apos;t really change that much .
musicians who ended up there did the best they could .
and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls , so that they don &apos;t get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor .
david byrne : how architecture helped music evolve
he said , &quot; your sermons have certainly helped me . &quot;
how do we solve these three problems that i &apos;d like to mention ?
albert einstein -- i was just talking to someone , when i was speaking at princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
and it &apos;ll be on these questions : where did i come from ? why am i here ? where am i going ?
i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture .
and i said , &quot; there &apos;s one thing that we have in common in this room , all of us together , whether republican or democrat , or whoever . &quot;
the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind . &quot;
equally well known is pascal &apos;s wager .
but by faith i said , i believe him , and he came into my heart and changed my life .
i will craft my own drum .

she remembered , for example , when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital , and she had a lot of x-rays , and two of them were leg x-rays , which made sense , but six of them were chest x-rays , which didn &apos;t .
but still gayla went on , and finally she succeeded in getting a federal agency to come to town and to screen the inhabitants of the town -- 15,000 people -- and what they discovered was that the town had a mortality rate 80 times higher than anywhere in the united states .
what the research shows is that some people are blind out of fear . they &apos;re afraid of retaliation .
and what they &apos;re very prepared to do is recognize that yes , this is going to be an argument , and yes i &apos;m going to have a lot of rows with my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends , but i &apos;m going to become very good at this conflict .
i wish for her to be a nurse . &quot;
she &apos;d lie beside me and say , &quot; auntie , i wish to be well .
and then someone asked me , just before my tedtalk , a few days ago , &quot; so where is the hope ? &quot;
i will fulfill the wish .
teen pregnancy , like i said , is epidemic .
these little girls turned to him and said , &quot; we will vote you out of office . &quot;
i &apos;m talking about j.c.r. licklider &apos;s human-computer symbiosis , perhaps better termed &quot; intelligence augmentation , &quot; i.a .
when you put it all together , it &apos;s quite a computational challenge : 3,500 victims , 1,800 adjacency requests , the importance of the overall physical specifications and the final aesthetics .
why so challenging ? because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns , they can &apos;t learn to do that based on patterns they &apos;ve never seen before , and organized crime has a lot in common with this audience : brilliant people , relentlessly resourceful , entrepreneurial spirit — — and one huge and important difference : purpose .
in that last question , a surprising insight was revealed .
shyam sankar : the rise of human-computer cooperation
it &apos;s particularly important -- this isn &apos;t on the world wide web , is it ? i &apos;m about to get fired -- it &apos;s particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation .
walk the dog . have sex again .
and i understand .
she turned out to be a much bigger dog than i &apos;d anticipated .
these impacts are coming everyone &apos;s way .
many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding .
physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety , the placement of the waste and other facilities , which , if done properly , don &apos;t compromise a community &apos;s quality of life .
anyway -- ok . katrina . prior to katrina , the south bronx and new orleans &apos; ninth ward had a lot in common . both were largely populated by poor people of color , both hotbeds of cultural innovation : think hip-hop and jazz .
my agency is working closely with columbia university and others to shine a light on these issues .
you , however , are blessed with the gift of influence .
in an emotionally charged talk , macarthur-winning activist majora carter details her fight for environmental justice in the south bronx -- and shows how minority neighborhoods suffer most from flawed urban policy .
and i will talk on , is this possible ?
and it moves up with mao tse-tung getting health , not getting so rich .
and there &apos;s a lot of infrastructure things , and general human resources are there .
sweden was like ghana .
the oecd countries -- the high-income countries -- they were the ones who caused the climate change .
these are all pictures and images from africa , and it can become much better .
you can do this .
we need everything .
human rights is the goal , but it &apos;s not that strong of a mean for achieving development .
so i started taking a look at them .
you often see them in situations like this , or like this , and there &apos;s no doubt that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing and chatting and texting and gaming .
so i think there &apos;s so many different ways that people can express themselves using this , to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world .
you learn more about how computers work .
so as kids like victor are creating projects like this , they &apos;re learning important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the start .
it &apos;s scratch.mit.edu , and give a try at coding .
that for whatever reason , these three proteins have entered a space in the language of our field that &apos;s called the undruggable genome -- which is like calling a computer unsurfable or the moon unwalkable .
and so we worked with samples of material that were collected by young pathologists at brigham women &apos;s hospital .
well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn a prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical substance .
we don &apos;t have a team of salespeople and marketeers that can tell us how to position this drug against the other .
and if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky , and you just keep the shutter open , as long as your camera is attached to the hubble space telescope , it will see something like this .
the gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the big bang .
the fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you die , always in that order , that &apos;s because entropy is increasing .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at least have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy .
and so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away , there will always be some radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
so boltzmann says , we will only live in the part of the multiverse , in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles , where life is possible .
the universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so .
either it &apos;s just like that . there is no explanation .
it was a simple machine that changed my life .
i looked at my father and looked at those dry fields .
so , on stage that day in arusha , my english lost , i said something like , &quot; i tried . and i made it . &quot;
what i got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars .
so , in order to realize this dream , i actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head .
what we &apos;re doing here is actually -- for example , in this case , the book cover is matched with so many thousands , or maybe millions of books online , and checking out which book it is .
paper world is interesting to play with .
pm : there is a lot of energy here . lots of learning .
actually it was a very hard challenge .
it &apos;s going to be a place where people can meet , where you can put nature .
a kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway .
this was an old building in a favela in rio -- &#91; unclear favela name &#93; -- that we just transformed into a primary school , with high quality .
almost every year we have these landslides , which are terrible .
we had heavy traffic early in the morning and in the rush hour in the afternoon , but nothing of big concern .
a city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party , which are cities .
or just think about american jazz or american movies -- they go everywhere .
he actually used that word .
but the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this .
but still , one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings : the beauty we find in skilled performances .
they &apos;re going to be small .
we can run the score up against anybody , and then get our asses kicked in the second half -- what they call fourth generation warfare .
i was in china in august , i said , &quot; you should have 50,000 peace keepers in iraq .
what i think this really represents is lack of an a to z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states .
but here &apos;s the deal .
you &apos;re america . &quot;
the berlin wall falls . we do desert storm .
bad pentagon , bad ! &quot;
can of whup ass , the networking force .
but i know this organization doesn &apos;t change until it experiences failure .
international organizations , non-governmental organizations , private voluntary organizations , contractors .
i say , &quot; great , i &apos;m going to take the sys admin budget out of your hide . &quot;
i call it the smart dust navy .
most firemen in this country do it for free .
so about that time , the national federation of the blind , or nfb , challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently .
the system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car .
so here you can see the left camera , the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix .
but this vehicle is a prototype vehicle , and it &apos;s not going to be on the road until it &apos;s proven as safe as , or safer than , today &apos;s vehicle .
i looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
a hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what i &apos;d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
this type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
and so i agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered .
there is a -- imagine that life originated on europa , and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years .
there is something called pit lamping .
we can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding of genetic engineering , one of the things you can do with your take-it-home , do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit -- -- is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite , a place like europa , so we could colonize europa with our own creatures .
so , in anticipation , i would be this young designer in the back of the room , and i would raise my hand , and i would ask questions .
so , we had to design both the light and the light bulb .
and then , on the other side of the room , the designers are making small adjustments , sketching , drawing by hand , putting it in the computer .
this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head .
so a pretty big endeavor , and we worked on the dispensers .
and there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise , and as we sat there , over the mountains coming in from the north were these steven spielbergian clouds rolling toward us , and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley , so help me god , every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time .
good morning .
a flock of relatives descended on her .
she told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside afghanistan , and that her organization , the afghan institute of learning , had started a school in pakistan .
and i smile , and i nod , realizing i &apos;m watching women and girls using their own religious traditions and practices , turning them into instruments of opposition and opportunity .
liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades .
then things get tense .
and they need allies from their communities .
i blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary , and i posed a kind of crazy promise to the internet : that if you asked me for a hand-written letter , i would write you one , no questions asked .
and as a chemist , one of the things i wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is , could we make a really cool universal chemistry set ?
and if that doesn &apos;t seem fanciful enough , where do you think we &apos;re going to go ?
and if there was a big emphasis at the time to separate men from women , the rituals around the kaaba could have been designed accordingly .
and quite tellingly , some muslims do practice that .
and as the subtitle suggests , i looked at islamic tradition and the history of islamic thought from the perspective of individual liberty , and i tried to find what are the strengths with regard to individual liberty .
that trend is generally called islamic modernism , and it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen , not just as an intellectual idea though , but also as a political program .
but the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed islamic groups in their country actually made the islamists much more strident .
and they did not turn out to be the islamist boogyman that the dictators were always using to justify their regime .
it &apos;s gray , formless .
and researchers have used this fact in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain , recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually .
in kenya , contested presidential elections in 2007 -- we just heard about them -- quickly led to high levels of inter-ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people .
what is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story .
and significantly , there &apos;s also a clear focus on both the rights of individuals and the rights of communities .
so even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal , local leaders and international leaders have a choice , and they can make a difference for the better .
thank you .
water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the earth .
fish tried amphibian life . frogs adapted to deserts .
but when that ancient continent broke up , life got lusher .
we &apos;re molded by the same life force .
not so with movember . movember started in a very traditional australian way . it was on a sunday afternoon .
and we sat down , and i shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across australia , raising awareness for this cause , and funds for his organization . and i needed a partnership to legitimately do that .
so i cold-called the ceo of prostate cancer canada , and i said to him , &quot; i have this most amazing concept . &quot;
and they go , &quot; what , what do you mean ? &quot;
so now , that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer .
i met benki three years ago in sao paulo when i &apos;d brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples to meet with me and leaders from around the world , because we wanted to learn from each other .
and he &apos;s brought the internet and satellite technology to the forest -- both so that people themselves could monitor the deforestation , but also that he could speak from the forest to the rest of the world .
and this reminds me of something i understand lord salisbury said to queen victoria over a hundred years ago , when she was pressing him , &quot; please change . &quot;
when i asked sanghamitra , &quot; how did you get from english literature to hiv / aids ? &quot;
it &apos;s the spirit inside . &quot;
they didn &apos;t go to business school .
and if we &apos;re lucky , we can change the way our great-grandchildren will answer benki &apos;s question .
and so , when you study it , you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world .
to understand this difference in viewpoints , we have to understand the subjective truth of alexander -- his myth , and the mythology that constructed it .
you see , he had heroes , like ram -- raghupati ram and krishna , govinda hari .
two different mythologies , two different ways of looking at the world .
there are many promised lands , depending on your station in society , depending on your stage of life .
and mythology does not pay , well , until now .
how do you enhance the sensitivity of people to indian-ness .
and everybody asks me , &quot; which is the better way , this way or that way ? &quot;
those trying to have good careers are going to fail , because , really , good jobs are now disappearing .
ah . but i still want a great career .
passion , interest -- it &apos;s not the same thing .
i want to be a great friend . i want to be a great spouse .
but then you were born . &quot;
there are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography -- women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn &apos;t work well at all .
there &apos;s a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms , and that &apos;s because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret , and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause .
mammograms have been around since the 1960 &apos;s , and it &apos;s changed very little .
so if you will allow me a little creative license , i will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient &apos;s problem with a physicist &apos;s solution .
after the injection , the patient &apos;s breast is placed between the detectors .
and i &apos;m very happy to report that we &apos;re now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram .
of course we should .
we &apos;re the new technologists .
now i see some puzzled looks like , &quot; why are you asking us what &apos;s the right thing to do ?
leave him alone .
how can we use numbers as the basis for a moral framework ?
they all have two-ness in them .
that sound familiar ?
it doesn &apos;t matter what the calculations are .
hannah arendt said , &quot; the sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who choose to be evil .
in fact , find somebody from the humanities .
we determine how this will all end .
in our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds .
if you make some noise you can feel the effect .
i &apos;m just a designer . so i need them .
and you have to peel and eat one layer a day .
and the idea was to create some self-moving benches in the main exhibition room .
so while i &apos;m talking to you , the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas . sorry for that .
and the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish , by a water pump , feeds the plants above .
this is an inspiration image to lead this project of the office .
in the early &apos; 80s , some would say .
and it was a perfect drug . you could sell for -- buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar , sell it for five dollars .
this is about 1990 -- peak of the crack epidemic .
and they made them available to us .
which already , i think , foreshadows the main result that i &apos;ve talked about , about what a crappy job it was being in the gang .
now to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack -- and i &apos;m not really focusing on the negatives , but really , there &apos;s another story to tell you there -- if you look at the death rates -- just of random , young black males growing up in the inner city in the united states -- the death rates during crack were about one percent .
they just leased them -- because they couldn &apos;t afford to own the fancy cars .
they &apos;re going to come into your neighborhood .
and that &apos;s me in the background , carving around the whole formation in freefall also , with the helmet cam to film this jump .
extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step , if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge .
all right . well we will watch this space . but i have two more questions .
in the studio we do a lot of experiments .
and my idea was to make the space tangible .
the water has an ability to make the city negotiable , tangible .
the big mountains far away , they move less .
how do we create an idea which is both tolerant to individuality , and also to collectivity , without polarizing the two into two different opposites ?
i spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean , one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away .
ew : it was like it was teasing us , doing a kind of fan dance -- now you see me , now you don &apos;t -- and we had four such teasing appearances , and then on the fifth , it came in and totally wowed us .
i &apos;ve been working on a project for the last six years adapting children &apos;s poetry to music .
she died alone in 1940 in the company of her books and her dear friends .
decrescendo .
and now people from iran are talking to me .
the day after , iranians started to respond with their own posters .
you have palestine-loves-israel .
you can go and travel and meet people .
and really , we can be our own ambassadors .
the cliche of the radical architect is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment .
and we saw this guy , haibao .
you &apos;re not supposed to fly on holidays because it &apos;s bad for the environment .
we donate 1,000 bikes to shanghai .
they tried to pass a law against moving the mermaid .
and essentially , the apartments cover the parking .
so he asked us if we could actually imagine an urban master plan on an island outside the capital that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains of azerbaijan .
bjarke ingels : 3 warp-speed architecture tales
but that &apos;s a wrong problem to ask .
and since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list than there is number ones , it makes perfect sense not to want to do such a list .
and then you ask , why economists ?
what they basically show us , the average of all macroeconomic models , is that kyoto , if everyone agreed , would cost about 150 billion dollars a year .
if we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years , we could bring that incidence down to half .
i &apos;d like to have you look at your priority list and say , did you get it right ?
we have , you know , &quot; the day after tomorrow &quot; -- it looks great , right ?
they had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
meanwhile , american ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions , motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets .
she &apos;s been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty , specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over 300 million people out of indigence .
in a recent study , the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last .
indeed , the supreme court justice stephen breyer reminds us that it took the united states nearly 170 years from the time that the constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the united states .
ultimately , it &apos;s about transforming the world and making it a better place .
you will adapt to it and get used to it .
i &apos;m a big list maker , so i came up with a list .
so as a fashion designer , i &apos;ve always tended to think of materials something like this , or this , or maybe this .
you don &apos;t have to do anything to it ; you just literally watch it grow .
align it in this direction .
suzanne lee .
so i spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south china factory city called dongguan .
how much will it take to buy an apartment or a car , to get married , or to put my child through school ?
and yet , his view of the world persists , and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses , to imagine that we can know what they &apos;re really thinking .
so , if you really want to help these workers , start these small , very focused , very pragmatic classes in these schools , and what &apos;s going to happen is , all your workers are going to move on , but hopefully they &apos;ll move on into higher jobs within apple , and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement .
hazrat ali is from a poor farming family in swat .
effectively , this is the brainwashing process that has begun .
if my intention was to eradicate evil for islam , then i will be rewarded with paradise .
carolyn porco shares exciting new findings from the cassini spacecraft &apos;s recent sweep of one of saturn &apos;s moons , enceladus . samples gathered from the moon &apos;s icy geysers hint that an ocean under its surface could harbor life .
was the internet actually a place that you could visit ?
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started thinking about this , there was one cable down the western coast of africa , represented in this map by steve song as that thin black line .
and when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw , you stop thinking about the internet as a cloud .
but today , it is becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful .
we can have 3d printers today that build structures like these .
you can &apos;t create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually .
you can use software like google sketchup to create products from scratch very easily .
you can direct what color that product will be , perhaps what material .
but with mri data , we can just build the product , as you can see , very intricately .
and we forget this now , but back then the mujahideen were celebrated in this country , in america .
and it filled this old imam , it filled him with great sadness .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that we can relax .
he killed 3,000 innocent people , and that filled the muslim world with horror and revulsion , and what that meant was that his idea of jihad could never become mainstream .
time , patience , subtlety , understanding -- these are harder to give .
and they would look quizzically , and then be like , &quot; high five ! &quot;
you think i will miss the violence or the drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
even last year , i ended up hiking up mt . kilimanjaro , the highest mountain in africa .
matt cutts : try something new for 30 days
first , the coursework at caltech .
so i tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost-effective solar electricity .
on an average adjusted day , a solar cell -- because the sun &apos;s moving across the sky , the solar cell is going down with a sine wave function of performance at the off-axis angles .
and the hot air engine also was not invented by robert stirling , but robert stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved it .
that &apos;s a heat engine .
so this is the engine .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it will cool itself .
this is the map of the united states .
bill gross , the founder of idealab , talks about his life as an inventor , starting with his high-school company selling solar energy plans and kits . learn here about a groundbreaking system for solar cells -- and some questions we haven &apos;t yet solved .
our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each , on minute timescales .
and each one of the 11 chapters of the ipcc has six to ten subsections .
and so what happened was that i started just becoming an editorial illustrator through , you know , sheer whatever , sheer ignorance .
so , i hopefully am writing , you know , books that are good for children and for adults .
but you know , we said , &quot; david , who &apos;s going to know ?
who knows ? the new york timesselect , the op-ed page , asked me to do a column , and they said , you can do whatever you want .
so , &quot; my beautiful mother &apos;s family fled russia as well .
or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying ?
and a woman who lives on our street , lolita .
i thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with .
td : so , even though i &apos;m somewhat happy about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world , still , i feel a sense of impediment , when it comes to the ability that we have to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart , or a mind-to-mind , level .
td : so , every one of you who has come here is so talented , and you have so much to offer to the world , i think it would be a good note to conclude on then to just take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas and really form a strong aspiration and energy within ourselves that we will take the good that has come from this conference , the momentum , the positivity , and we will spread that and plant it in all of the corners of the world .
so if you look , you can see a lot of different machines come out of this . they all move around .
and one of the things that i think is important is that we have to get away from this idea of designing the machines manually , but actually let them evolve and learn , like children , and perhaps that &apos;s the way we &apos;ll get there . thank you .
we &apos;re now seeing outbreaks in human populations -- so far , fortunately , small events , tiny outbreaks , occasional clusters .
the result : most of the deaths have been in people under 30 years of age , robustly healthy young adults .
everything is about your town , where you live .
what they found was , the core functions -- you know you still sort of had banks , but you couldn &apos;t get people to put money in the atm machines .
nevertheless most of the governments have based their whole flu policies on building stockpiles of tamiflu .
a new study by chris murray at harvard shows that if you look at the databases that were kept by the brits in india , there was a 31-fold greater death rate among the indians .
at a minimum the british banking plan showed that telecommuting can be helpful .
and i don &apos;t know that there is any way responsibly for someone to start medicating their children with their personal supply of lipitor or something of that nature .
but we don &apos;t really know .
but if you come about it from a different perspective , you can create some more interesting , more novel concepts .
last year , i created a one-man show .
the magician looked at me and said , &quot; this is a disaster .
he said , &quot; philippe , you have been had .
i was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection .
faith is what replaces doubt in my dictionary .
so i said , now it &apos;s okay . the room is too small .
and at the end i bang my hand against the pole to dislodge the bird .
thank you . thank you .
but rather , it is their leaves that are adapted to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog .
people who grew up in a place like this did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees and forests , as i did when i was a young girl .
they danced in the forest , and we are taking this dance , my scientific outreach communications , and also linking up with environmental groups , to go to different cities and to perform the science , the dance and the environmental outreach that we hope will make a difference .
and they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses .
a unique ecosystem of plants , birds and monkeys thrives in the treetops of the rainforest . nalini nadkarni explores these canopy worlds -- and shares her findings with the world below , through dance , art and bold partnerships .
the transparency law they &apos;d passed earlier that applied to everybody else , they tried to keep it so it didn &apos;t apply to them .
and how is it possible that the volume of information can be processed that needs to in this system ?
so i can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak . it was amazing . i mean , it was amazing .
so that -- yes . yes ! my power pose .
i &apos;m not just an ichthyologist , i &apos;m a bona fide fish nerd .
we &apos;re all breathing air right now . air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen , about 20 percent oxygen . about 80 percent nitrogen is in our lungs .
it makes you loopy .
well , there are three main advantages to a rebreather .
and that , fittingly enough , is called the diluent gas supply .
it &apos;s kind of like skydiving in slow motion .
and if you &apos;re a biologist and you know about sharks , and you want to assess , you know , how much jeopardy am i really in here , there &apos;s one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately which is -- diver 1 : what kind of sharks ?
here &apos;s another new angelfish we discovered .
so a very large percentage of what is out there isn &apos;t really known .
because once you &apos;re dead , you really can &apos;t enjoy anything after that .
their groundbreaking technology records the eeg , or the electrical activity of the brain , in real time , allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions : vision , attention , language , audition .
but we are now in a new era of neuroscience , one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects , non-invasively , and find the true source of so many disabilities in children .
he built the capital over there .
moshe safdie : he was a real nomad .
shamsul wares : it was almost impossible , building for a country like ours .
so , my question : are we alone ?
so , what exactly is seti ?
even our nearest star , the sun -- its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed .
we are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process .
today , our signal detection algorithms can find very simple artifacts and noise .
and then , we &apos;d like to augment the automated search with human insight .
this past january , i traveled to a place called wais divide , about 600 miles from the south pole .
yes , i said that with a q , quadrillion .
moreover , in this 8,000-mile journey , they have to insure this ice doesn &apos;t melt .
that &apos;s called a profit .
they &apos;re not going to export your uncle &apos;s buick .
and these policies work fine without taxes , subsidies or mandates .
moreover , three-fourths of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car .
each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set , instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel .
you are paid to pick efficiency within a size class , in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three .
and make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster .
these people aren &apos;t that smart .
we launched two titles in october -- &quot; rockett &apos;s new school &quot; -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place , with a blank slate , which allows girls to play with the question of , &quot; what will i be like when i &apos;m older ? &quot;
girl 4 : we make a school newspaper on the computer .
he &apos;s invited all the best people .
brenda laurel : games for girls
he painted a beautiful vermeer .
among other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how powerful you are , it &apos;s always better to own an original than a forgery because there &apos;s always going to be fewer originals than forgeries .
they get people into a fmri scanner , and while they &apos;re lying there , through a tube , they get to sip wine .
this was recorded in 1931 .
then we asked other groups of subjects -- we gave them different restrictions and different conditions .
i use jackson pollock on purpose as an example because there &apos;s a young american artist who paints very much in the style of jackson pollock , and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars -- in large part because she &apos;s a very young artist .
now i &apos;ve been talking so far about pleasure , but what i want to suggest is that everything i &apos;ve said applies as well to pain .
and nobody really knows what epidemiology is .
in science , we don &apos;t care how many letters you have after your name .
and that &apos;s a really useful thing to describe in a scientific paper , but on the question of your own personal risk of getting breast cancer if you drink red wine , it tells you absolutely bugger all .
all the previous trials were positive , and we know this one &apos;s gonna be too . &quot;
so we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated , which is why we do trials where we control against a placebo -- where one half of the people get the real treatment and the other half get placebo .
but -- and it &apos;s a big but -- it turns out , when you look at the methods used by industry-funded trials , that they &apos;re actually better than independently sponsored trials .
that &apos;s how you can prove it statistically , but what about stories ?
i &apos;m very sorry if you have the flu , i know it &apos;s horrible , but we &apos;re not going to spend billions of dollars trying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day .
and they built beautiful cities all powered on that coal .
because you know why they &apos;re here , and you know what they &apos;re doing here .
it &apos;s because somebody else has a design for your resource .
and you feel it ; you see it every day .
and their leaders , their leaders : before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country -- and you know the reason -- before they send them off , they go to a christian church , and they pray to their christian god , and they ask for protection and guidance from that god .
it &apos;s a holy war against muslims .
and go to the website .
you have it wrong . you &apos;ve missed it .
it &apos;s an american , american soldiers , american woman who lost her loved one in the middle east -- in iraq or afghanistan .
can you go there ?
and now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do too .
year after year after year , absolutely incredible .
this is practically the model of ted .
well how else can we create new ideas ?
1996 : less than one million new university students in china per year ; 2006 : over five million .
here is gdp per capita from 1900 to 1929 .
because the truth is , when they light their candles at ours , there is twice as much light available for everyone .
in fact , we live on a mostly unexplored planet .
and that may be just the beginning !
the human juggernaut is permanently eroding earth &apos;s ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym &quot; hippo , &quot; the animal hippo .
it is an encyclopedia that lives on the internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world .
aldo leopold said this was a biological storm , a feathered tempest .
there &apos;s an ibex in spain called the bucardo .
so this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome of an extinct species with the genome of its closest living relative .
there &apos;s three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species , they &apos;re recreating extinct ecosystems in northern siberia , in the netherlands , and in hawaii .
ben novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting .
there were just 254 left .
most of that we &apos;ll do by expanding and protecting wildlands , by expanding and protecting the populations of endangered species .
and when your parent is a drug addict , it &apos;s kind of like charlie brown trying to kick the football , because as much as you want to love on that person , as much as you want to receive love from that person , every time you open your heart , you end up on your back .
when i was in the third grade , i wrote a book for the first time , &quot; the owl who thought he was the best flyer . &quot;
and to this day , i still can do karaoke to &quot; ice , ice baby &quot; without looking at the screen .
on my 14th birthday , my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever : a drafting table that i have worked on ever since .
so after this experience , my art teacher , mr. shilale , he brought in these picture books , and i thought , &quot; picture books for kids ! &quot;
the local bookstore made a big deal of it .
i &apos;ve seen people have &quot; punk farm &quot; birthday parties , people have dressed up as &quot; punk farm &quot; for halloween , a &quot; punk farm &quot; baby room , which makes me a little nervous for the child &apos;s well-being in the long term .
if the space i &apos;m sending it in is not effective , that communication can &apos;t happen .
they had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds putting the walls in . let &apos;s stop this madness of open plan classrooms right now , please .
that is not good for you .
hey , let &apos;s all be interior sound designers , take on listening to our rooms and designing sound that &apos;s effective and appropriate .
this is not a box ; these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life .
but the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn &apos;t seen the kids that attentive .
it &apos;s a human and technological revolution .
and how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat ?
so what they do is they put gelatin back in , in order to retain the texture .
well , this must be the strangest thing i found .
and the second , is that we actually don &apos;t have a clue of what all these products that surround us are made of .
and i said to her , &quot; well , your year is going to be long and arduous , dear . &quot;
i was somebody when i came .
and when my mama died two years ago at 92 , there were so many former students at her funeral , it brought tears to my eyes , not because she was gone , but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear .
the world wide web , the french are told , ought to be referred to as &quot; la toile d &apos;araignee mondiale &quot; -- the global spider web -- recommendations that the french gaily ignore .
so a tempting generalization for a child , for an adult , for a computer is that any verb that can appear in the construction , &quot; subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient &quot; can also be expressed as &quot; subject-verb-recipient-thing . &quot;
you can think of this as the language of thought , or &quot; mentalese . &quot;
and you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer , is asked to show his driver &apos;s license and holds his wallet out with a 50-dollar bill extending at a slight angle out of the wallet .
well , what does this have to do with language ?
and a similar analysis , i think , can apply to the potential awkwardness of a sexual solicitation , and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset .
i &apos;m interested in academic arguments today , and here are the things that puzzle me .
of those three , the argument as war is the dominant one .
you believe a proposition , p , and i don &apos;t .
in order to do that , well , i don &apos;t know how to do that .
and i &apos;m also thrilled to be in the foreplay section .
and so they still weren &apos;t getting it .
what they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere ; they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world .
that &apos;s a geranium pollen .
here &apos;s an interesting one for the it world : bio-silicon . this is a diatom , which is made of silicates .
color without pigments : this peacock is creating color with shape .
timed degradation : packaging that is good until you don &apos;t want it to be good anymore , and dissolves on cue .
and yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year .
you can &apos;t count what you don &apos;t see .
and that was actually an excellent business , because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood .
and in many places , they &apos;re there .
because investors saw the potential for return at a time of slowing economic growth , and so they created financial products and financial innovation tailored to the emerging markets .
and when i complained to my grandmother , a world war ii veteran who worked in film for 50 years and who supported me from the age of 13 , that i was terrified that if i turned down a plum assignment at abc for a fellowship overseas , i would never ever , ever find another job , she said , &quot; kiddo , i &apos;m going to tell you two things .
but then one author arrived , and he changed the game forever .
joe sabia : the technology of storytelling
and there &apos;s a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade-offs .
and so the question is : how could we make that back ?
and after 10 years of this , my wife eventually said , &quot; look , you know , you gotta do this thing you &apos;ve been talking about , and build the vending machine . &quot;
so this is betty . she &apos;s a new caledonian crow .
so now , students at the university of washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask .
and it uses skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages .
mind you , there &apos;s 216 million dollars &apos; worth of change lost every year , but i &apos;m not sure i can depend on that roi from crows .
the atlanta airport is a modern airport , and they should leave the gate there .
and huck gets on the raft with a property named jim , a slave , see .
and i got this in the maryland correctional institute for women .
and then he told her , get up .
it was captured on videotape -- technology -- and it was played all over the world .
he is the only model for black community ; i don &apos;t care jesse jackson .
and this is called &quot; toughness . &quot;
i mean , i can &apos;t even imagine what it &apos;s going to be like the last day i rodeo . i mean , i &apos;ll be alright .
so i brought my whole cabinet , and we met with all of the pooh-bahs of little greenville -- the mayor , the city manager , the head of the community college -- and we basically emptied our pockets and put all of our chips on the table , incentives , you name it , to convince electrolux to stay , and as we made our pile of chips , we slid them across the table to the management of electrolux .
we got a problem , folks .
and imagine what might happen , because every region has something to offer .
what if it all started here at ted ?
all the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them .
and then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites , they truly dominate the social media space , which is a space that &apos;s having a huge impact on old media .
once upon a time we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity .
this is similar to the slow heating of water in this test tube reaching the boiling point , where the instability of the water occurs and you have the phase transition to vapor .
we have applied this theory to many systems , landslides , glacier collapse , even to the dynamics of prediction of success : blockbusters , youtube videos , movies , and so on .
the chinese market collapsed , but it rebounded .
the next day , the market started to change regime , course .
they rock the mic outside my window every morning .
space is length and breadth continued indefinitely , but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in america because countries are beginning to eat like us , live like us and die like us .
alright . i &apos;m going to show you a couple of images from a very diverting paper in the journal of ultrasound in medicine .
you gotta love that . rutgers .
i said to her , &quot; you should do an experiment .
and apparently the royal court physician said to her , &quot; i am of the opinion that the vulva of your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time prior to intercourse . &quot;
which i thought was an interesting idea , theory .
she said , &quot; it was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva .
this was not idle curiosity .
because once john committed himself to putting his life back together -- first physically , then emotionally , and then spiritually -- he found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did .
but those shoes came with round nylon laces , and i couldn &apos;t keep them tied .
terry moore : how to tie your shoes
and i can show here a very good example .
and yeah , it &apos;s the sort of thing you produce when you &apos;re doodling on the phone .
yeah , it &apos;s a -- this one here , that &apos;s much better .
and you know , there you had this little sign -- i put this little sign outside the door every morning that read , &quot; please tidy room . &quot; i don &apos;t know if you have them over here .
the pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels .
i am no designer , nope , no way .
oh , oh , dad . oh , dad .
and i said , &quot; oh , girls , dad is a very important journalist , that just wouldn &apos;t do at all . &quot;
someone making the experience their own .
in fact , the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord-injured males was invented by a veterinarian .
facing the given with intent . doing things by design .
what shall we do ?
design blew it all away for a moment .
jo jo was a man who thought he was a loner but he was another man . jo jo left his home in tucson , arizona to attend a california bash . get back , get back , get back to where you once belonged . get back , get back , get back to where you once belonged .
reading his words , i welled with anger .
i then began to wonder , as i had many times before , how my life would have been different had this man not injured me , had my genes been fed a different helping of experience .
i listened to her words . i suppose they were true .
abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck , and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver in the left lane who did not let him pass .
was it evidence of guilt , an assertion that he should have been put away longer ?
i wished to tell him that , in the end , our mandate is clear : we have to rise above bad fortune .
one is hierarchical pores , and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material .
so , we &apos;ve made 20 robots in the last eight years , during the course of getting my ph.d .
sitting is so incredibly prevalent , we don &apos;t even question how much we &apos;re doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn &apos;t even occur to us that it &apos;s not okay .
nilofer merchant : got a meeting ? take a walk
i actually like that one .
i guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks .
for example , all the courageous tedtalks : &quot; people dying , &quot; or &quot; people suffering , &quot; was also one , &quot; with easy solutions around . &quot;
and yet , speculative though the idea surely is , i aim to convince you that there &apos;s reason for taking it seriously , as it just might be right .
how ? well according to einstein &apos;s math , if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy , sort of like a uniform , invisible mist , then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive , repulsive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observations .
it has internal inconsistencies , unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar -- extra dimensions of space .
in this context , the laws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many numbers .
and when it comes to planets and their distances , this clearly is the right kind of reasoning .
because the theory predicts that the big bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded , tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world , yielding a distinctive fingerprint , a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots , across space , which powerful telescopes have now observed .
are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion ?
now , you notice he &apos;s sitting .
why not just , instead of pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad , why not use your body just to lean on the chair -- again , relaxed ?
it &apos;s very , very interesting that men , more than women , tend to be more competitive here .
now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to milo .
thank you very much indeed .
i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes .
and there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes .
i &apos;m not even a humanitarian aid doctor , and i can &apos;t tell you the times of how helpless i &apos;ve felt to have people dying in front of me , and i couldn &apos;t save them .
because , if you don &apos;t know yet , everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms , comes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains and define our memories , our beliefs , our feelings , our plans for the future .
because the idea was to actually turn on this brain-machine interface and have aurora play the game just by thinking , without interference of her body .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
this is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously .
so , let &apos;s start off in china .
she went to high school .
how many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more females in the world ?
so research has shown , if you look at people who live under two dollars a day -- one metric of poverty -- two percent of that take-home pay goes to this basket here , in education .
we don &apos;t have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed .
the foreign missionary opened the door , knew exactly what had happened , took her to a nearby fistula hospital in addis ababa , and she was repaired with a 350-dollar operation .
he does the transportation and distribution , and she does the production and sourcing .
so you see how transformative little bits of help can be .
here was a woman who had worked in darfur , seeing things that no human being should see .
now language &apos;s subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship , in books you can &apos;t read , phrases you can &apos;t use and words you can &apos;t say .
these upright apes evolved on the african savanna about two million years ago , and they made these splendid hand axes that fit wonderfully into your hands .
and most importantly for this , it &apos;ll tell us why we have language .
let &apos;s imagine that you are really good at making arrowheads , but you &apos;re hopeless at making the wooden shafts with the flight feathers attached .
now having evolved language , though , we did something peculiar , even bizarre .
our modern world is communicating with itself and with each other more than it has at any time in its past .
thank you .
so that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible , that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line .
and the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
ken went and ran his models , and found that it did .
and it turns out , i woke up the next morning , and i started to calculate this .
now , suppose that space aliens arrived .
it &apos;s not a good idea , but it &apos;s just important .
should we do serious research on this topic ?
over a five year period following september 11th , when the american media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders , most notably weapons of mass destruction , i chose to look inward at that which was integral to america &apos;s foundation , mythology and daily functioning .
this is a u.s. customs and border protection room , a contraband room , at john f. kennedy international airport .
this is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into america are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine , where they are tested for diseases including exotic newcastle disease and avian influenza .
and after i took this photograph , they constructed a wall around the world church of god to mimic the set-up of mosques in afghanistan or iraq .
he was convicted by an all-white jury of rape , kidnapping and vehicle theft .
william gregory was convicted of rape and burglary .
i put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem .
and we found through this whole process , we found this great little manufacturer in virginia , and if his body language is any indication , that &apos;s the owner — — of what it &apos;s like for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer , you &apos;ve got to see what happens here .
you can see the united states and california and san diego , and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around .
i &apos;m going to double-click on uranus , and we can see uranus rotating on its side along with its moons .
if you want to keep going , if you want to change the camera angle , you can do that , and because of that , i can show you that voyager 1 doesn &apos;t just fly by saturn .
it was clean , efficient , there was no high , there was really no danger , it had no street value .
we &apos;re wired for dangers that are immediate , that are physical , that are imminent , and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endogenous opioids come in .
people have also wanted to deconstruct .
it wouldn &apos;t do anything but press this bar .
and if you stick your tongue out at this baby , the baby will do the same .
we are very acutely aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it .
but very similarly , the only one that survived there was happiness .
princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development , which is really true .
well don &apos;t talk rat , but we have a clicker , a standard method for animal training , which you see there .
especially in africa where t.b. and hiv are strongly linked , there is a huge common problem .
throughout last year , we &apos;ve been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we &apos;ve been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between 30 and 40 percent .
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
for one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .
so , it &apos;s empathizing the other person being touched .
now the astonishing thing is , if you have pain in your phantom limb , you squeeze the other person &apos;s hand , massage the other person &apos;s hand , that relieves the pain in your phantom hand , almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged .
that little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube , and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another morina flower , just on the right species , what happens ?
isn &apos;t that cool ?
there is an invisible beauty all around us , each grain with a story to tell ...
heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer .
bernadine healy , dr. healy , was a cardiologist .
it was a study to specifically ask , what &apos;s going on with women ?
cellulite here , cellulite here .
and if you look carefully , you can see that there &apos;s a black blush right there .
these are female and male stem cells .
you now , hopefully , have a more personal relationship with your heart .
we observe the cells in a plate , and they &apos;re just on the surface .
and after one week , it &apos;s beating .
well that &apos;s exactly the journey that my family began five and a half years ago .
and over the course of the next half-year , he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form , &quot; water . &quot;
what about the visual context ?
dr : she offers water , and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water .
and we get this wordscape , except now words are not assembled in my living room .
so a lot of people are following this person -- very influential -- and they have a propensity to talk about what &apos;s on tv .
listen very carefully .
and primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry , just the simplest of shapes .
so , for example , when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around , to selectively create a visual logic .
you &apos;ll be able to figure that out .
right there -- those are hickory nuts .
then , this is a house based on a budweiser can .
then , another bathroom upstairs .
never mind that it doesn &apos;t affect our lives at all .
apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste .
&quot; oh , just looking for some header material , &quot; waiting for that kudos .
&quot; so i thought palm harbor village was over there . &quot;
so if i &apos;m eating spaghetti , and i know i &apos;m alone , i can eat like a backhoe .
i see you don &apos;t have designer jeans .
but you don &apos;t say that , because they &apos;re the guys you &apos;re targeting .
and when they do , they find that behind the glass , they find me .
there &apos;s the egyptian god horus , which symbolizes prosperity , wisdom and health .
all of this is leading -- computer addiction , just to cover that : the most frequent thing we do is use digital devices .
here &apos;s my brain .
it meant that when i was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in 50 minutes , i might score an f .
i was fortunate to find a dentist who applied this entire universe of technology you &apos;re about to see to establish that if he repositioned my jaw , the headaches pretty much resolved , but that then my teeth weren &apos;t in the right place .
and i &apos;m just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed .
and during my time in coma , she had been laid to rest in her hometown of phoenix .
this down here , if the camera can see that , that is a small antenna .
simon lewis : don &apos;t take consciousness for granted
the error margin is narrow . here i put life expectancy at birth , from 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years .
where are the different countries ? i can show you africa .
i can split arab states . how are they ? same climate , same culture , same religion -- huge difference . even between neighbors .
and if i go down and look at niger , where there was such a terrible famine , lastly , it &apos;s like this . the 20 percent poorest of niger is out here , and the 20 percent richest of south africa is there , and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in africa .
and that &apos;s a quite clever guy , huh ?
but it slightly bores me .
and it was at indiana i got the impression that , you know , the gene was likely to be dna .
and certainly , neither crick or i were chemists , so we tried to build a model . and he knew , francis knew wilkins .
well , if the peak ph that cells have is around seven , those hydrogen bonds couldn &apos;t exist .
and we knew it was big because , you know , if you just put a next to t and g next to c , you have a copying mechanism .
and on both occasions , you know , one of us was missing the tie .
but wigler , besides looking at cancer cells , looked at normal cells , and made a really sort of surprising observation .
now , we don &apos;t have really any evidence of it , but i think , to give you a hypothesis , the best guess is that if you &apos;re left-handed , you &apos;re prone to schizophrenia .
that is your best case outcome when you get sued by a patent troll .
they &apos;re not under nda either .
so unfortunately i &apos;m not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem .
they really enjoyed each other &apos;s company .
they shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish .
but to get us started , i want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world .
and it happened so fast in the united states , however , that even just last month jon stewart said this : jon stewart : where is polio still active ?
we &apos;re not trying to control polio .
so it was a massive effort .
now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years , much longer than it should have -- but once it was built , the results were striking .
these are children like umar .
but as we tried these extraordinary things , as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics , we went back to the vaccine -- it &apos;s a 50-year-old vaccine -- and we thought , surely we can make a better vaccine , so that when they finally get to these kids , we can have a better bang for our buck .
the huge social movement that &apos;s been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children .
give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year .
and she took us on a journey and revealed something very special to us -- her own daughter , eight days old .
dj : now one of the big things , of course , everybody knows that cats hate water , and so this was a real revelation for us .
we &apos;re on the edge through a large part of the time .
and the only way we thought we could without scaring her is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make -- a hiss and a sound .
dj : so at this stage , i guess , we had very , very firm ideas on what conservation meant .
dj : so what our investigations have shown is that these lions are essential .
it &apos;s so queer that physicists resort to one or another paradoxical interpretation of it .
moving to the other end of the scale , our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light . if they had , our brains would be much better at understanding einstein . i want to give the name &quot; middle world &quot; to the medium-scaled environment in which we &apos;ve evolved the ability to take act -- nothing to do with middle earth .
a whirlpool , for steve grand , is a thing with just as much reality as a rock .
i &apos;ve speculated that bats may see color with their ears .
one way to think about that is by counting planets .
treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate , but it &apos;s a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next .
we were looking forward to rebuilding it , but eight months after we moved in , i suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect .
it was then i realized that i could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight , giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible .
he : thank you , chad .
what we can see here is the metal sheet , this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator .
well , there is still a lot to explore in its early days . and there &apos;s not many people working in this field .
my ted wish . there &apos;s a vital story that needs to be told and i wish for ted to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era .
&quot; cala a boca , galvao &quot; actually means something very different .
and again , that was very shocking to many twitter users , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
it turns out that in many cases atoms are much more mobile than bits .
and you &apos;ll discover that there are parts of the globe that are systematically cut off .
even within wikipedias , where we &apos;re creating their own content online , there &apos;s a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the wikipedia authors are based , rather than to the rest of the world .
and so the people who founded foko club in madagascar weren &apos;t actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country .
who &apos;s going after chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
i can ask her what to read .
and every week on this television show , dhani travels to a different nation of the world .
just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den . &quot;
i remember in iraq , for example , that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy .
after i speak to you today , i &apos;m going on a radio program called &quot; any questions , &quot; and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never , ever say that they don &apos;t know the answer to a question . it doesn &apos;t matter what it is .
nasa , for example , serves thermal-stabilized sweet-and-sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts .
so , fortune cookies : invented by the japanese , popularized by the chinese , but ultimately consumed by americans .
because it doesn &apos;t look like chinese food to them .
this is actually in the library of congress ; it is a pamphlet published by samuel gompers , hero of our american labor movement , and it &apos;s called , &quot; some reason for chinese exclusion : meat versus rice : american manhood against asiatic coolieism : which shall survive ?
there &apos;s indian chinese food , korean chinese food , japanese chinese food , where they take the bao , the little buns , and they make them into pizza versions , and they take -- and they -- like , totally randomly they &apos;ll take chinese noodle dishes , and they &apos;ll just ramen-ize them .
you know , there are a bunch of them , including lee &apos;s china in omaha -- which is actually run by koreans , but that &apos;s another point -- and a bunch of them named china buffet .
jennifer 8 . lee : the hunt for general tso
so these three psychiatrists , after about two or three weeks of observation , laid him down on a table , connected his temples to a very small source of current .
it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english , no one could read or write english .
it was impossible . so they decided there was no therapy , there was no treatment . but there was one treatment , which actually had been pioneered at the hartford hospital in the early 1940s , and you can imagine what it was . it was pre-frontal lobotomy .
well , the gilbert and sullivan fans in this room will remember &quot; ruddigore , &quot; and they will remember mad margaret , and they will remember that she was married to a fellow named sir despard murgatroyd .
accidents happen . something from childhood comes back to haunt you .
gb : well , of course national identity remains important .
and i would say that national interest and , if you like , what is the global interest to tackle poverty and climate change do , in the long run , come together .
gb : i think every religion , every faith , and i &apos;m not just talking here to people of faith or religion -- it has this global ethic at the center of its credo .
and you have politicians who have -- you &apos;re elected . in a way , you can &apos;t say that .
but we did get an agreement on climate change .
and then the secretary general of the united nations came up to speak to god and said , &quot; when will our international institutions work ? &quot;
and so in the reverse engineering process that we know about , and that we &apos;re familiar with , for the textile industry , the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things .
but you can do other things .
it &apos;s edible , so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food .
i &apos;m also interested in creating new technologies for the arts and to attract people to science and technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and booing -- i hope not -- to help make some of its next decisions .
the operator says , &quot; just take it easy .
it &apos;s a norm . it &apos;s a social norm .
the threat to worry about is whether or not we &apos;re getting our fair share of strangeness .
it simply makes the point that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity .
and it &apos;s not a banal story -- after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the &apos; 70s .
later on , in france , i loved eavesdropping on grownups &apos; conversations , and i would hear all sorts of stories about my father &apos;s previous life , especially that he had &quot; done &quot; world war ii , that he had &quot; done &quot; the algerian war .
and with his only diploma , his primary education certificate , he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner .
all the movements stopped at falsifying .
in order to write the book , i asked my sister questions . i wanted to know who my father was , who was the father she had known .
he was much younger in those days , and my father agreed to make false papers to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting .
we &apos;ve had the same , roughly , abilities that developed civilizations as we know it .
and i can tell you , you enter the disciplinary research in each of these , you find something remarkably important , the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves , that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet , the decade when we have to bend the curves .
and could we even , thanks to major advancements in earth systems science , identify the thresholds , the points where we may expect nonlinear change ?
in fact , there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change , that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative , a transformative gear , across scales .
and we need a transformation .
see , for instance , in this picture .
because when i decided to go into advertising , i wanted to do -- i wanted to airbrush naked people on ice , for whiskey commercials , that &apos;s what i really wanted to do .
i had a chance to go to florence , in -- i think it was &apos; 94 , and i saw ghiberti &apos;s &quot; door of paradise . &quot;
i got some photographs from them .
i ended up narrowing the subject to monet &apos;s &quot; haystacks . &quot;
that &apos;s why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that .
and they are around three billion such letters long .
perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed .
and one question that you may then want to ask is , what happened when we met ?
we call this group of humans , that we then described for the first time from this tiny , tiny little piece of bone , the denisovans , after this place where they were first described .
we cannot predict the future .
how can we bring more natural light into the airplane ?
and this is combined with a top-down approach , because what we are doing in our daily life is we train our muscles , we train our skeleton , and it &apos;s getting stronger .
most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long-stay hospitals . this is a long time ago .
those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others .
there are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled , but there are those that are gifted .
and in fact , we are very interested in those first two years of life , because those liabilities don &apos;t necessarily convert into autism .
they start over here , they love people &apos;s eyes , and it remains quite stable .
and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities .
then they give you 10 minutes .
if you don &apos;t get an opening shock , you don &apos;t get a parachute -- you &apos;ve got a whole new problem set .
and when we took off from the airfield , america was at peace .
and i went up to apologize to him , and he said , &quot; stanley , i thought you did great . &quot;
probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference , the ages , had changed so much .
and you have to watch and take care of each other .
and it isn &apos;t always fair .
and in the course of the exhibition -- which was contentious , controversial and ultimately , for me , life-changing in my sense of what art could be -- a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other .
and mohammed ali said , &quot; me , we . &quot;
for me , it is about re-imagining this cultural discourse in an international context .
as norwegian social scientist evelin lindner has observed , &quot; pessimism is a luxury of good times ...
and we can see world-changing values in something as humble as a cell phone .
that &apos;s understandable and important .
now , all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis .
i started with that sentence about 12 years ago , and i started in the context of developing countries , but you &apos;re sitting here from every corner of the world .
two months later -- and this is now documented in the information technology for international development journal -- that accents had changed and were remarkably close to the neutral british accent in which i had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer .
i mean , if there &apos;s stuff on google , why would you need to stuff it into your head ?
one of the referees who refereed the paper said , &quot; it &apos;s too good to be true , &quot; which was not very nice .
remember , from the hole in the wall .
the granny cloud sits over there .
i started writing english questions on the blackboard .
we could change everything .
it wasn &apos;t going to be written down . it was no news .
and being a theater person , what i know and love about the theater is that when the audience comes in and they suspend their disbelief , when you see men walking or women walking with a platter of grass on their heads , you know it &apos;s the savanna .
and this material really did work for a woman equally as well .
so i went from theater , doing &quot; the tempest &quot; on the stage in a very low-budget production many years ago , and i love the play , and i also think it &apos;s shakespeare &apos;s last play , and it really lends itself , as you can see , to cinema .
bono : they &apos;re mythologies .
it &apos;s my company &apos;s trials by fire .
we have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things .
now , when you look at some of the data on the screen above , things like heart rate , pulse , oxygen , respiration rates , they &apos;re all unusual for a normal child , but they &apos;re quite normal for the child there , and so one of the challenges you have in health care is , how can i look at the patient in front of me , have something which is specific for her , and be able to detect when things start to change , when things start to deteriorate ?
we think that the race is on to do something differently .
and the women said , &quot; you know , jacqueline , who in nyamirambo is not going to buy doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall american woman ? &quot; and like -- -- it &apos;s a good point .
but as human beings , we also want to see each other , and we want to be heard by each other , and we should never forget that .
so that &apos;s about 50,000 people affected .
it &apos;s a 40-year-old company , it understands manufacturing .
we can continue going along at 12 dollars a net , and the customer pays zero , or we could at least experiment with some of it , to charge one dollar a net , costing the public sector another six dollars a net , give the people the dignity of choice , and have a distribution system that might , over time , start sustaining itself .
we &apos;ll be showing the video at the end , but before we do , i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted .
so the machine would get started , it would travel some distance , reacting along the way , hit play on an ipod or a tape deck or something that would start playback .
but as much as the small stuff stinks , we needed somewhere to start , so that we would have somewhere to go .
i mean , &quot; curiosity &quot; -- excuse me .
as a matter of fact , this is by far the most important commission that leonardo has ever had , and for doing this great masterpiece , he was named the number one artist influence at the time .
well , we believe , again , that this should be the beginning , the very first step , to do real conservation , and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation , the technique , materials , and also if , when , and why we should restore , or , rather , to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting .
we induce cells , okay , say , skin cells , by adding a few genes to them , culturing them , and then harvesting them .
but that &apos;s not even all of it , because once a drug is approved , tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments .
and the biggest problem came in the last 25 years : it went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent .
this was the full size of the original creature .
some things he showed as a celebration at the very end .
and matt &apos;s plane was on the cover of popular science last month , showing what this can lead to . and in a while , something this size will have gps and a video camera in it . we &apos;ve had one of these fly nine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour with just a little battery in it .
and so i just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there , but you can fill in whatever you want . this is not a forecast .
and i wanted to let you know , a lot of the things you &apos;ve heard about australians are true .
i fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages .
- 1 = 31 .
lucas again , in 1876 , showed us - 1 , 21 digits long , was not prime .
but i came to a realization about my own ability .
this is all seven harry potter novels , because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end .
it can take a randomly shuffled rubik &apos;s cube .
we thought it might be there , and we went and found it .
however , we now believe that this is the first sighting of a new disease , which is now an epidemic spreading through tasmania .
one in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives .
in fact , jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you .
the vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor , a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs .
my personal aim is to defeat the tasmanian devil cancer .
out of four british people , three said that they were optimistic about the future of their own families .
and it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
he found that the students were willing to pay the most not to get a kiss immediately , but to get a kiss in three days .
but it also changes objective reality .
the average likelihood is about 30 percent , &quot; the next time around they would say , &quot; yep . still think it &apos;s about 11 percent . &quot;
and what he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s passing a small magnetic pulse through the skull of the participant in our study into their inferior frontal gyrus .
the key here really is knowledge .
what happened ? the industrial revolution , europe and america became the dominant center of the world .
so we &apos;re seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power .
in the 1980s , as america went through a transition in the reagan period , between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the silicon valley economy of california , that was the end of america .
but you might ask , well so what in any case ?
the united states is the only superpower , and it &apos;s likely to remain that way for two or three decades .
and that &apos;s going to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the 21st century .
and they stay high regardless of the political innovations .
that &apos;s one actor , the security council .
the united nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts ; it &apos;s called the peace building commission .
that is not a good idea .
and to date , there has been a sort of a schizophrenia in the donor community , as to how to build basic services in post-conflict sectors .
but , if we put money into the core budget , we know that there aren &apos;t the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent .
other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways .
now these are examples of new orleans rebuilding in this way , but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind .
sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems , agriculture , even major cities . this is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the mekong delta .
but we can simply no longer rely on established norms .
t : i don &apos;t want to let myself down .
is english a tsunami , washing away other languages ? not likely .
but in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table -- peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of rickety .
and her answer shocked me . it stunned me .
and they weren &apos;t flashing in anger , they were flashing in love , intense love for her students .
i was creating a lesson for students on africa .
there &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
it &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
i thought i was failing as a teacher . why would she do this ?
everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the winners are not gloating .
but he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .
but i don &apos;t try to deny them that reality of being human .
live with them ; love them .
this becomes an isosceles triangle -- again , very shaky .
if you , as a matter of fact , put four marbles inside , you simulate the molecular structure of methane , ch4 .
there are four pictures .
and this is what newton talked about 400 years back , that white light &apos;s made of seven colors , just by spinning this around .
and we &apos;re just trying to see possibilities .
but this has come as a great boon for them .
and there were lots of passengers on the ship , and they were getting bored , so the captain invited them on the deck .
the nearest we &apos;ve come is with aramid fiber .
and in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes .
so they were paid to collect it from the restaurants .
the more vegetation we lose , the more that &apos;s likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification .
and when you think about nature , often you think about it as being all about competition .
and if you think about the carbon in that , that would have come out of the atmosphere , into the sea and then locked away in a building product .
so my name is amy webb , and a few years ago i found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion .
are the families going to get along ?
and that was my entire month &apos;s rent .
i wanted somebody was jew ... ish , so i was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture , but wasn &apos;t going to force me to go to shul every friday and saturday .
she said she is &quot; silly , nice and friendly . &quot;
remember , i &apos;m somebody who said that i speak fluent japanese and i know javascript and i was okay with that .
a year after that , we were married , and about a year and a half after that , our daughter , petra , was born .
and i &apos;m almost sure most of you have thought , &quot; oh , come on , can &apos;t you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies ? &quot;
so we &apos;re actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision , and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better .
but a few kids are sad and blue because they &apos;ve forgotten their coat .
now i &apos;d like you to remember that result , and put it in the context of another group of technology users , a group which is actually much revered by society , which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking .
so that &apos;s really the crux of the research , and to do that , we need to go one more step .
none of you . and you probably have had that feeling , right , picking up an education game and sort of feeling , hmm , you know , it &apos;s not really fun , it &apos;s not really engaging . so what we need is really a new brand of chocolate , a brand of chocolate that is irresistible , that you really want to play , but that has all the ingredients , the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can &apos;t recognize but are still working on your brains . and we &apos;re working on it , but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together , people that work in the entertainment software industry , and publishers , so these are not people that usually meet every day , but it &apos;s actually doable , and we are on the right track .
now we get another result , still very simple .
it doesn &apos;t take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation ; just something that happens , naturally , things with rules as simple as these can do it .
or let &apos;s try asking about , i don &apos;t know , the international space station .
you know , i &apos;ve realized that wolfram alpha actually gives one a whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing , in which one &apos;s starting not just from raw computation , but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge .
this is just an example of one of these computable documents .
actually , i haven &apos;t shown these before , but here are a few of the candidate universes that i &apos;ve looked at .
are you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe ?
and this has already saved millions of lives , and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in sub-saharan africa .
i invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality .
he came home once a year .
i told my father , &quot; i will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school . &quot;
we were taken care of .
so i had to come up with something to do with the morning , because there &apos;s good news in the morning .
i wanted to do something .
and i looked at her , i remember that day , and i saw something beyond what i was seeing in angeline .
move out , because as you change your world , as you change your community , as we believe that we are impacting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time .
this is something i call the 50-20 paradox .
visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than they &apos;re using credit cards .
we &apos;re going to go through four value-shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors , that offer new management principles .
they &apos;ve just instituted dynamic pricing .
also a really interesting company is gore-tex .
perfect example of that is patagonia .
then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling , which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled .
but , at the same time , this is also a tremendous opportunity .
i &apos;m telling you where i &apos;m insecure .
now in the early 1970s , in ankara , that was a bit unusual .
ironically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the like-minded is one of the greatest dangers of today &apos;s globalized world .
the child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
i love writing in turkish , which to me is very poetic and very emotional , and i love writing in english , which to me is very mathematical and cerebral .
he was looking for a turkish woman in the book because i happened to be one .
some people criticized , others praised me for writing about the turkish-armenian conflict .
if it cannot take us there , it is not good literature .
as long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity .
instead , these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property .
it &apos;s a 28-page software patent , but i will summarize what it covers . spoiler alert : unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger .
he records a song called &quot; blind willie mctell , &quot; named after the blues singer , and the song is a voyage through the past , through a much darker time , but a simpler one , a time when musicians like willie mctell had few illusions about what they did .
just look at google maps here . there &apos;s block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
so i want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do .
it &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
so below the ice , there &apos;s an ocean of liquid around the whole moon .
well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing .
and one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics , just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that describes transistors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.4 times the mass of the sun .
i think that &apos;s a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the structure of atoms here on earth .
and after it visited all four of those planets , carl sagan , who &apos;s one of my great heroes , had the wonderful idea of turning voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited .
he said this , he said , &quot; nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate , that our triumphs are complete , that there are no mysteries in nature , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
the visualization you see forming behind me is called collusion and it &apos;s an experimental browser add-on that you can install in your firefox browser that helps you see where your web data is going and who &apos;s tracking you .
this is nothing . i am being stalked across the web .
thank you .
and people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; john , what are you doing ? &quot;
well , that just ended communication .
the first story is i didn &apos;t have any money -- that &apos;s a sign i used a lot .
now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
well , my journey kept going on .
i was walking through el dorado -- it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or infamous prison -- in venezuela , and i don &apos;t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .
i didn &apos;t know who i would be if i changed .
on my ninth birthday , my parents couldn &apos;t give me any food to eat .
but if i didn &apos;t believe it , i wouldn &apos;t even try , and then i would die .
textbooks and the library were not my playground .
you have to choose to believe in hope .
nuna , it has been already 10 years that i haven &apos;t seen you .
year 2000 , there was a big expo in germany .
for example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
so he never trusted me , but i didn &apos;t give up .
and in 2008 , in chengdu , sichuan area in china , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
finally i met a very nice mayor in onagawa village in miyagi .
i write books and magazine articles .
so fetuses are even learning about the particular language that &apos;s spoken in the world that they &apos;ll be born into .
but actually , the nine-month-long process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that .
but others wouldn &apos;t be discovered for many years .
when the planes struck and the towers collapsed , many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster -- the overwhelming chaos and confusion , the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris , the heart-pounding fear for their lives .
and keep your eyes on the big screen .
but audiences don &apos;t come to see the magician die , they come to see him live .
it &apos;s a uniquely human achievement .
brothers jonny , robbie and tommy mizzone are the sleepy man banjo boys , a trio of virtuoso bluegrass musicians who play with dazzling vivacity . did we mention they &apos;re all under 16 ?
it &apos;s the lift , it &apos;s a series of buttons in the lift .
so you walk for another hundred yards , expecting perhaps another sign , that might courteously be yellow , in front of you and saying &quot; trains . &quot;
let &apos;s face it , most of us -- how many of you actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine ?
then there are other things that don &apos;t cost much and achieve absolutely nothing .
the excitement from using multi-tracking , the way i did in the piece you will hear next , comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers , all generated from a single source .
it &apos;s essentially got a battery , a button and an infrared led , and it turns on -- you guys can &apos;t see it -- but it turns on whenever i push the button .
youtube has really changed the way , or changed the speed , in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world .
and for the first time , i began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people .
and i think the way that we go through that sometimes can , first of all , disembody a group of people , individuals out there in the world .
i was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .
a few months later , i went back to uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner , matthew , and i had kind of built , and took pictures of seven of my new friends , posted their stories , these stories of entrepreneurship , up on the website , spammed friends and family and said , &quot; we think this is legal .
imagine if you &apos;re speaking with somebody who &apos;s growing things and making them flourish , somebody who &apos;s using their talents to do something productive , somebody who &apos;s built their own business from scratch , someone who is surrounded by abundance , not scarcity , who &apos;s in fact creating abundance , somebody with full hands with something to offer , not empty hands asking for you to give them something .
and so , as i have been thinking about this , i &apos;ve been wondering : how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to catalyze all of us to make tomorrow better than today ?
but the good news is i don &apos;t think i need to stand here and convince you to care -- i &apos;m not even going to try .
is there alien life out there ?
this suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high .
the alternative is that civilizations don &apos;t last very long , but destroy themselves .
why not ? so find your monotask spot within the multitasking world .
actually he did , but it turned out to be the u.s. air force , which doesn &apos;t count as extraterrestrial intelligence .
so this means that over the course of the next two dozen years , we &apos;ll be able to look at a million star systems , a million star systems , looking for signals that would prove somebody &apos;s out there .
and i kept waiting for the men in black to show up . right ?
normally when you look out into the universe , you &apos;re looking back in time . all right ?
i mean , in the 18th century , in the 18th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library , if you could find the library , right ?
this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science , because seti involves all kinds of science , obviously biology , obviously astronomy , but also geology , also chemistry , various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of , &quot; we &apos;re looking for e.t. &quot;
let me just say , look , my job is a privilege because we &apos;re in a special time .
cephalopods -- head-foots . as a kid i knew them as calamari , mostly .
so , he &apos;s bluffing . let &apos;s do it backwards -- i thought he was joking when he first showed it to me .
after i was invited by ted , i did some digging , because that &apos;s what we do , to know about my host .
you find elephants , rhinos , monkeys , pigs , etc .
in a way , this was like the second birth for the child , after 3.3 million years , but the labor was very long .
and among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included : first , this skeleton documents , for the first time , how infants looked over three million years ago .
you know , that is very exciting for us , because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively , and that evolution is in the making .
that &apos;s what i call positive african attitude .
we used to think the solution to pollution was dilution , but that has proved to be no longer the case .
the sargasso sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat .
it &apos;s protecting five world heritage sites .
we can also tag and track fishing vessels .
and i think , jeez , i &apos;m in the middle of a room of successful people !
now a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionaires .
right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to youtube every single minute .
now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
and archie cochrane , as the camp doctor , was one of the first men in to clear up the mess .
if we don &apos;t supply vitamins to the prisoners , it &apos;s a war crime . &quot;
three pieces of data is nothing .
i &apos;m not trying to solve the middle east problem .
you could use it in an industrial context .
you see how this works , right ?
so i say , okay , fine .
nevertheless , archie managed to get permission to do this .
it isn &apos;t easy .
there are many science-based analyses of this , but they all draw the same conclusion -- that we &apos;re living beyond our means .
there are so many ways we can improve the way we do things .
and that &apos;s what will happen to us .
i could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this , but i won &apos;t because , if you want to see it , that evidence is all around you .
but this time it &apos;s not a tiger at the cave mouth .
you can read the details , but in summary , we can transform our economy .
this could be our finest hour .
at worst , possession -- that he &apos;d been seized by an evil jinn , a spirit out to deceive him , even to crush the life out of him .
like fundamentalists of all religious stripes , they have no questions , only answers .
call this naive if you like .
one is leverage .
and he gave an interview in december .
we &apos;ve got to limit other mandatory spending .
that &apos;s where the ability to engineer microbes , the ability to engineer tissues , and the ability to engineer robots begin to lead to a reboot .
the team from taiwan was a little bit more ambitious .
so there are now nine women walking around boston with re-grown bladders , which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life .
and this stuff is moving very quickly , and by the way , that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight .
and it &apos;s the 150th anniversary of the publication of &quot; the origin of species . &quot;
and so , as a consequence , a few years later , another scientist -- perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him , but building on the invention of the first one -- came up with a second cure .
and people were very angry , and they called him horrible names .
one thing that &apos;s interesting : if you look at frontal-impact crashes -- when the car crashes , the front hits into something -- indeed , what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better .
so this is going to be a crash where they &apos;re going to slam this thing forward into a wall at 30 miles an hour , and see what happens . ok ?
and then here &apos;s the six-year-old in the seatbelt , and in fact , they get exactly within , you know , within one or two points of the same . so really , for the six-year-old , the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever .
it &apos;s almost like this thing here , which you can &apos;t even see . &quot;
there &apos;s simply no economic model that that would be possible .
and i started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe on all the computers .
i have three kind of general things i would like to say , three consequences of this .
the web , in some sense , is kind of like a black hole that &apos;s sucking up everything into it .
in a certain sense , the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras .
so besides physically coming out again into this idea that it &apos;s not just virtual , it &apos;s actually going out to things .
and so we are in the middle of this thing that &apos;s completely linked , down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has .
and thirdly , it &apos;s going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment , and we will be in the middle of it .
and within a week i had come to believe that the second coming of christ had occurred , that it was sun myung moon , and that i had been specially chosen and prepared by god to be his disciple .
their mates were chosen for them .
and so if you looked at my brain , or any brain that &apos;s infected with a viral memetic infection like this , and compared it to anyone in this room , or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis , i am convinced it would look very , very different .
we make physical things , buildings that become a part in an accretional process ; they make cities .
and what i &apos;m interested in is not the styling of that , but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity .
and the idea was the relationship of the space , which was made up of the fold of the image , and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration , and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space , which were in dialog .
well , that immediately turned into something much broader , and as a scope .
this is the first sketch of a high school in pomona -- well , whatever it is , a model , a conceptual , kind of idea .
the new capital competition for berlin , four years ago .
and we spent some time with conan , believe it or not , and then that led us to , kind of , the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic , architectural .
so i would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves .
we populated all the ecologies .
think about bittersweet chocolate ; or think about the acidity of yogurt -- wonderful -- mixed with strawberry fruits .
now if you think about the gut , the gut is -- if you could stretch it -- 40 meters long , the length of a tennis court .
so what happens if the big brain in the integration overrides the signal ?
so our research -- and i think the research also at the universities -- are now fixing on these points to say : how can we actually -- and this might sound trivial now to you -- how can we change cooking ?
now , all people share the same raw , adaptive imperatives .
what is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth ?
i spent 30 years living amongst the people of chinchero and i always heard about an event that i always wanted to participate in .
take a direct north-south bearing , you find to your astonishment that it bisects the intiwatana stone , goes to the skyline , hits the heart of salcantay , the second of the most important mountains of the incan empire .
the gourd is a feminine aspect ; the stick is a male .
and then of course , as we reached our final destination , a place called mamancana , we were in for a surprise , because the farc were waiting to kidnap us .
they &apos;re unique facets of the human imagination .
but first , i need to talk to you about what i consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category .
this recycling system has been in place for the last billion years .
if you &apos;re in china , you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull .
they used to use a plastic packaging buffer , but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance with our grown material .
now he confused me from the very start , because light doesn &apos;t cool things down .
so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment , it seemed like the more he said , the less i understood .
now that assumes half-hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of 35,000 dollars , and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time , and given that there are some apparently 30 million powerpoint presentations created every day , that would indeed add up to an annual waste of 100 billion dollars .
perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury of just sitting in an audience with no other purpose than to witness the human form in motion .
we &apos;re not top on people &apos;s lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on .
imagine this half of the audience each get out coins , and they toss them until they first see the pattern head-tail-tail .
it takes longer , on average .
if it &apos;s a tail , you crack open the champagne .
the natural thing to do after you &apos;ve done that -- and that &apos;s what this project , the international hapmap project , which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries .
well , you &apos;re right to be a bit skeptical , because that &apos;s not the answer .
here &apos;s a more topical example of exactly the same thing .
so if a family suffers from one cot death , you &apos;d put them in a high-risk group .
we know the children died .
and everyone said , &quot; well , that &apos;s fine . he &apos;s an expert . &quot;
so what about circuit breakers ?
and i &apos;m pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition , the 2009 ces innovation award .
same was true for china .
on the one hand , he wants to satisfy people &apos;s need of a social network , which is very important ; people really love social networking .
and also , recently , very funny debate between the beijing environment ministry and the american embassy in beijing because the ministry blamed the american embassy for intervening in chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of beijing .
it became the media platform of 300 million readers .
they even name themselves -- you know , use the name of this world-changing battle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab .
but from february to april this year , weibo really became a marketplace of rumors .
and also , like facebook and google , they claim they are friends of the mouse , but sometimes we see them dating the cats .
now if you had to pick a sense to lose , i have to be very honest with you and say , we &apos;re better at restoring hearing than we are at restoring any sense that there is .
now actually , this is quite crude in comparison to our regular inner ear .
in fact , most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad .
but it certainly wasn &apos;t the way the music was intended .
this is ... does somebody know ?
when i was 12 years old , i was one of the first few people in singapore who underwent cochlear implantation .
when i look around this tedxamsterdam venue , i see a very special audience .
it means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets .
as the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt , my father was an excellent marksman .
violence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years .
war is simply no longer the best option , and that is why violence has decreased .
it takes hard work , often behind the scenes .
it can be compiled into this -- into zeros and ones -- and pronounced by a computer .
if you change the spell again , you change the sequence again .
and all the hard pitches are actually below him .
women are much more in balance because they don &apos;t have that idea that they &apos;re going to be able to do 100 pull-ups .
i realized that my technologies had to make sense when i finished a project .
it took us half a century to adopt the telephone , the first virtual-reality technology .
a personal experience , when i was at mit -- computer taking up about the size of this room , less powerful than the computer in your cell phone .
it &apos;s the same thing here . we can &apos;t predict any particular project , but the result of this whole worldwide , chaotic , unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable .
we &apos;d like to actually turn that program off .
and this is less futuristic than it may sound .
we &apos;ve already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions out of the several hundred .
we &apos;ve demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this .
and you walk around , and it points to things .
and whatever they were doing just before they got the reward , they repeat that particular pattern .
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines , our pattern-seeking brain processes , to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that i &apos;ll come back to .
people that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this , which is allegedly patternless .
and if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists , they go away .
and what pattern do you see here ?
this is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle .
that is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning , intention and agency , often invisible beings from the top down .
but that &apos;s not what the &quot; 9 / 11 truthers &quot; think .
girl : no .
they are grown completely in a ball of dung .
but it doesn &apos;t flinch . it knows exactly where it wants to go , and it heads off in that particular direction .
well , they &apos;re looking at celestial cues in the sky , some of which you and i can &apos;t see .
so all we &apos;re interested in here is comparing the temperature of the beetle against the background .
but it &apos;s walking forwards , and it &apos;s actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it .
if he &apos;s using path integration , then it should end up in the wrong spot over here .
it &apos;s okay to applaud the laws of physics , but essentially what &apos;s happening here -- -- is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules is influencing the combustion properties of propane , creating a visible waveform , and we can see the alternating regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency , and the height is showing us amplitude .
and it &apos;s fascinating . at this moment in time , all the rest of the skaters turn their lines 90 degrees to stay out of his way .
there &apos;s still going to be no audio , but what i am going to do is i &apos;m going to render the sound visually in real time at the bottom of the screen .
now i &apos;m not actually sure that he did say that .
we were both thundering through this incredible siberian dawn , and part of me felt a bit like a cross between jason bourne and wilfred thesiger . part of me felt quite proud of myself , but mostly i was just utterly terrified .
there is a sort of misconception nowadays that it &apos;s all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure .
and there are obviously all kinds of things .
because even if you didn &apos;t do it right the first time , you &apos;ve learned the lessons , which are going to stand you in very good stead the next time .
i want somebody who knows , who can change the world out there .
any time you go backwards , any time you skip a step -- imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing , or the heights are different heights .
here he is . one little guy , black jeans and stuff , on a totally empty stage .
i want to know your product , and that &apos;s very important .
and i &apos;m thinking , &quot; this is really , really great . &quot;
and that is how to pitch to a vc .
that took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the earth .
this reminded the ancient egyptians of their god khepri , who renews the ball of the sun every morning , which is how that dung-rolling scarab became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the pharaoh tutankhamun .
and i really don &apos;t think it &apos;s that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that i &apos;m going to use now to click on the term for &quot; hand , &quot; go to the page for &quot; hand , &quot; where i found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia i &apos;ve found in a long time . it &apos;s simply this : the back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar .
and for me , i quickly landed on this one : the earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid , which is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls .
and worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , the economist .
how did this happen ?
step one : woman says , &quot; i want to have a baby . iskam baby . &quot;
untrusting -- you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so i &apos;m going to install cameras .
they can still hunt , but they can &apos;t be social .
for example , it &apos;s been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala , in the area where it controls emotions .
in fact , play improves our work .
it does work in bulgaria , you guys . two reasons .
you guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , aren &apos;t going to feel it .
seriously , we need to band together .
we &apos;ve gone to this world of many to many , where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting .
you could scroll back through it , but interestingly , if you were watching it live , there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets , you had no control over when you would read them .
so during the chicago mayoral election there was a parody account .
in this particular case , he &apos;s talking about drone strikes .
these were just some of the things i &apos;ve made .
the guild system : that means when i was an apprentice , i had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master .
so this gave me the possibility because now i was a journeyman , and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world .
and if this is the end of my five minutes , i want to tell you that i actually did survive , which was a surprise .
&quot; you &apos;ve got to make something good out of something bad , &quot; i started to say to my friends , neighbors , my sister .
my children , davey and henry .
we subscribed to a lot of magazines , did our homework , but really everywhere you look around , we were surrounded by images like this .
and instead , when the baby was placed in my hands , it was an extraordinary moment .
av : i don &apos;t want to embarrass him too much . but i am going to give him three seconds .
in the process of preparing this , we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time , because here in the western world , less than 50 percent of us live near our family members , which i think is part of why this is such a tough period .
in a survey , 74 percent of women said that miscarriage , they felt , was partly their fault , which is awful .
and part of what happens , i think , in your &apos; 20s and &apos; 30s , is you start to learn to hedge your happiness .
and if you have the right expectations and expectation management , we feel like it &apos;s going to be a pretty gratifying experience .
and this just didn &apos;t work until we could cross this line that says high-definition .
this is -- we have a fairly complex process that , you know , software and musicians and so on , but when we &apos;re all done , we know that the ear is the final arbiter .
the whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity .
it says right now , we think music is notes and how they &apos;re played .
and on the sweet spot on the stage , tatum starts playing ...
i &apos;ve been a civil servant , and i &apos;ve been in charge of policy for this guy as well .
and i think you can see around us now , some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism which could grow .
the biggest sector , by far , will be health -- already 18 percent of the american economy , predicted to grow to 30 , even 40 percent by mid-century .
and they &apos;ve been given new momentum by the crisis , by the need for better answers to joblessness , community breakdown and so on .
then , people said monarchy dominated everywhere because it was rooted in human nature .
let me tell you a little bit about savings rates , a little bit about language , and then i &apos;ll draw that connection .
all of this information is obligatory . chinese doesn &apos;t let me ignore it .
if , on the other hand , you speak a futureless language , the present and the future , you speak about them identically .
would you mind squeezing as hard as you can , in your dominant hand , this device so i can measure your grip strength ?
if savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure , smoking is just the opposite .
how did those students get all that knowledge ?
perhaps you have a computer scientist who &apos;s a genius .
i love it that we have a global language .
let me tell you a story about two scientists , two english scientists .
use it to spread great ideas .
and brian allen was able , in a miraculous flight , to get the gossamer albatross across the english channel , and we won the 100,000-pound , 200,000-dollar prize for that .
what &apos;s the population of the earth ?
this enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if she &apos;s sliding along on the ocean waves .
how old were you when you invented that ?
he experiences himself , his thoughts and feelings , as something separated from the rest , a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness .
and he had a lump of iron .
he thinks , &quot; what can i do to fix up this dog ?
what is this ? &quot;
but , you know , after all , they &apos;re nice to me .
and we see the mother in every being .
and then the fourth step , you go to what is called &quot; lovely love . &quot;
but actually they are cruel to themselves .
one thing we mustn &apos;t think is that compassion makes you miserable .
why is that important ?
all of these are possibilities .
anyone who tells you that we understand life , walk away .
anything else is more complicated .
their behavior is predictable .
one of them is from mr. einstein , and he says , &quot; everything should be made as simple as possible , but not simpler . &quot;
george whitesides : toward a science of simplicity
that &apos;s the idea of creativity .
so , you &apos;re in a big corporation .
now , six amateur astronomers , working with the internet , with dobsonian digital telescopes -- which are pretty much open source -- with some light sensors developed over the last 10 years , the internet -- they can do what jodrell bank could only do 30 years ago .
and we allowed users , readers , two places where they could contribute to the paper : the letters page , where they could write a letter in , and we would condescend to them , cut it in half , and print it three days later .
and i was having dinner with this guy called timothy chan .
imagine you could take all the children in education in britain , and one percent of them were co-developers of education .
but this project changed the way that i thought about connecting to people .
in the end , it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services .
so here &apos;s a series of projects over the last few years where i &apos;ve been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection .
zf : so what i did was i took those voicemails , and with their permission , converted them to mp3s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails .
so one of them was fairly straightforward .
so i asked her , &quot; what does it feel like when you feel this way ? &quot;
it &apos;s blind experiments . they also gave me normal people and everything .
and it does have some consequences .
okay , so that &apos;s the first case of matricide .
this is a picture about a year ago .
it &apos;s called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation .
so , that &apos;s one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine .
the lhc is certainly , when it turns on in summer , going to write the next chapter of that book .
raise your hand if you do . oh , wow .
smiling can help reduce the level of stress-enhancing hormones like cortisol , adrenaline and dopamine , increase the level of mood-enhancing hormones like endorphin and reduce overall blood pressure .
but i told him no , i &apos;m sorry , compromise in colors is gray , and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime .
and this was not a misplaced feeling .
we put the citizen first , and not the clerks .
make a city beautiful , curb corruption . edi rama took this deceptively simple path as mayor of tirana , albania , where he instilled pride in his citizens by transforming public spaces with colorful designs . with projects that put the people first , rama decreased crime -- and showed his citizens they could have faith in their leaders . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
they understood more than we did people &apos;s innate need to be connected .
the grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models , the old analog models of control and command .
in nigeria , open-source sms tools are being used by the red cross community workers to gather information from the local community in an attempt to better understand and mitigate the prevalence of malaria .
the disastrous earthquake in haiti taught humanitarian groups an unexpected lesson : the power of mobile devices to coordinate , inform , and guide relief efforts . at tedxrc2 , paul conneally shows extraordinary examples of social media and other new technologies becoming central to humanitarian aid . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it needs months and years .
and that &apos;s not all .
for example , it &apos;s said that there are more people in india with access to cell phones than toilets .
i first experienced these feelings with my grandmother .
ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says , the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me .
so she took me along to translate .
and then the next planting season , when they sang the dirge , they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born .
he just sat there watching me cry for an hour .
and so , i remember night after night , you &apos;d hear all these men , these really hardened criminals , huddled around john james , reciting , &quot; take that , spidey ! &quot;
&quot; libation , north carolina , 1999 .
when enough stars come out , they create a galaxy .
second theory is : could we upgrade ?
and as it continues , one of the things that &apos;s going to happen this year is we &apos;re going to discover the first 10,000 human genomes , because it &apos;s gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing .
and it turns out that as we discover these things , we human beings really like to change how we look , how we act , what our bodies do .
you can image it in two colors , which means you can download this information as binary code directly into a computer .
there really needs to be more research on this .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about the challenges in building these and some of the terrific opportunities for applying this technology .
so one of the advantages of this design is , when you scale things down , the robot naturally becomes agile .
the robots can be used for transporting cargo .
and the obstacles can be moving .
so again the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands 100 times a second , which then translates to the motor commands 600 times a second .
so his algorithm tells the robot what part to pick up , when and where to place it .
i &apos;m a professor , and we &apos;re passionate about education .
so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture .
a bit counterintuitive , right ?
think of the kids today . their childhood &apos;s a bit different .
i mean , really open your mind with this .
what can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future ?
i have two tentative male hands .
and it means that you now eat products , which can come from all around the world .
and today , bread now is associated with obesity , which is very strange .
if we do this , if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming we are going , actually , to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands -- among whom i have lived for many years , working without electricity and water , to try to improve their food production -- we relegate them to poverty .
what you see is that we &apos;ve started in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture , which was sort of small-scale and low-control .
food is as important as energy , as security , as the environment .
every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .
how do you make a mountain bike for your arms that doesn &apos;t have the mountain bike cost and complexity ?
so we teamed up with continuum , a local product design firm here in boston to make the high-end version , the developed world version , that we &apos;ll probably sell primarily in the u.s. and europe , but to higher-income buyers .
and i know we &apos;ve all seen images enough to make us numb , of the tragedies that we &apos;re perpetrating on the planet .
this is basically a base wherein we are trying to gather and learn virtually everything about the biodiversity of this incredibly complex forest system , and try to hang on to what &apos;s there , make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean , and of course , having a good time too .
this male snake , 12 feet long , met another male king cobra .
north central india , the chambal river is where we have our base .
suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river , dead .
and now &#91; these &#93; new elements of human intolerance for river creatures like the gharial means that if they don &apos;t drown in the net , then they simply cut their beaks off .
and they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing .
whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush .
this is a representative patient who at the time was 73 -- totally needed to have a bypass , decided to do this instead .
the fortuneteller says , &quot; i give smokers a discount because there &apos;s not as much to tell . &quot;
and these things occur within hours . this is a study : a high fat meal , and within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less -- and you &apos;ve all experienced this at thanksgiving .
you know , i don &apos;t like talking about the atkins diet , but i get asked about it every day , and so i just thought i &apos;d spend a few minutes on that .
while your cholesterol level has remained the same , the research findings have changed . &quot;
and finally , i said , i wonder if there &apos;s any relationship between how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth , whichever group they happened to be in .
and at the end of it , somebody said , &quot; hey , swami , what &apos;s the difference between wellness and illness ? &quot;
bb : there were many changes ...
we went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with david , and we ruled out , of course , swapping actors .
after many years of starts and stops on this project , and making that tough decision , they finally decided to greenlight the movie .
and then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer-generated character .
the subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras , and those cameras can , frame-by-frame , reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject &apos;s doing at the moment .
but we needed to get a database of him doing more than that .
and the software would tell us that , well , in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here , and it concludes moving in frame 32 .
we had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months .
we went about getting evidence of what was going on .
let &apos;s see if you can get something else . &quot; and we got the bear surrendered to -- we set up a sanctuary . we have four sanctuaries in india .
and the qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past that they &apos;ve lived all their lives .
we were in the desert , in wadi rum , in a small jeep .
i think the camel is the best designed animal in the world . &quot;
and they &apos;re similar . they have to kind of consciously open their nose .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants -- you know what i mean , like , &quot; br-r-r ! &quot;
and so we started thinking .
i &apos;m the go-to animal when the oasis is dry .
keith bellows : the camel &apos;s hump
so let us start with the first one .
bc : there &apos;s a horror movie in there somewhere .
but your face was absolutely straight when you twisted the lid down on the round tin where the matches , you said , are always stowed .
it &apos;s called &quot; to my favorite 17-year-old high school girl . &quot;
much later , as a student , i went to a very different garden , a zoological garden in arnhem where we keep chimpanzees .
and that &apos;s why many of you have a dog at home , which has all these characteristics also .
one is that the chimp on the right has a full understanding he needs the partner -- so a full understanding of the need for cooperation .
they develop several of these alternative techniques that we did not approve of necessarily .
also , we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion are highly empathic .
and here you have the two color tokens .
and we did that originally with capuchin monkeys .
she tests a rock now against the wall .
so here &apos;s his first follower with a crucial role ; he &apos;s going to show everyone else how to follow .
so , as we &apos;re told that we should all be leaders , that would be really ineffective .
thank you for that reaction .
i also tried to be the safest person i could be , because that &apos;s a part of health .
but the over-eating and over-drinking , definitely .
so i basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes -- throw in some sunflower seeds .
cheese ? chocolate ? where did that come from ?
a couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article .
my colleagues tal yarkoni and russ poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published .
but these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date , many of them children , and spect imaging involves a radioactive injection , so exposing people to radiation , potentially harmful .
maybe some cylindrical containers with some symbols on them .
so how big do you think that is ?
but deciphering the script is a very challenging task .
the answer is : if you look at the left-hand side of the two texts , you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a cramping of signs , and it seems like 4,000 years ago , when the scribe was writing from right to left , they ran out of space .
in the rest of the cases , typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer .
when this result was first published , it was highly controversial .
this suggests that the same script , the indus script , could be used to write different languages .
and so seven stars would stand for &quot; elu meen , &quot; which is the dravidian word for the big dipper star constellation .
space , we all know what it looks like .
the line carried the telephone signals that would later make bell a household name .
now any astronomer will tell you , this is the telltale sign of something that doesn &apos;t originate from earth .
artist-technologist honor harger listens to the weird and wonderful noises of stars and planets and pulsars . in her work , she tracks the radio waves emitted by ancient celestial objects and turns them into sound , including &quot; the oldest song you will ever hear , &quot; the sound of cosmic rays left over from the big bang .
because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do , a little bit tired , we do suffer .
you know , we really learned everything in the &apos; 60s .
i won &apos;t even say what they do . but he feels it .
robert thurman : we can be buddhas
we now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet , but who we will meet through the internet and through all the modern means of communication ; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with ; and i believe that this makes this a unique age in human history , and it is the start of what i would call the creation of a truly global society .
i was with nelson mandela a year ago , when he was in london .
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility , not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years .
last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death : &quot; don &apos;t worry . the united nations are coming . &quot;
but if you wanted to really do research , what do you have to do ?
the foot is distributed along the whole leg .
not just with the traditional foot , but also the leg , and even of the body .
but of course , we can deal with that because we can produce artificial spines .
this is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered when she figured out how lizards can run on water itself .
this is what it looks like close up -- here &apos;s the ant foot , and there &apos;s the glue .
there &apos;s enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields .
so the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right , attempt to make that climb , and ultimately put it on the robot .
since we are such a visual species , it &apos;s hard for us to really understand this , so i &apos;ll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it .
many mammals have to produce contact calls when , say , a mother and calf are apart .
anybody looking at this picture will know this dolphin is surrounded , and clearly his behavior is being disrupted .
the acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours .
in &apos; 95 they all sang the normal song .
imagine that whale listening from 500 miles .
one strategy is if your call &apos;s down here , and the noise is in this band , you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band and communicate better .
endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision , and it &apos;s very important to try to reduce this .
at the same time , we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems .
before i introduce the person responsible for the worldwide telescope , i just want to leave you with this brief thought : when i ask people , &quot; how does the night sky make you feel ? &quot;
there &apos;s a 10 percent differential between getting ba &apos;s and all graduate programs , with guys falling behind girls .
drugs , you want more of the same -- different .
however , the approach i built here is actually high-resolution , low-cost , and probably most importantly , very scalable .
this keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go .
i grew up in a traditional mexican family .
we were victims of the spaniards .
but , fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something .
it means it &apos;s determined and effective , but not violent .
i think anyone who has stepped foot on this land -- not to mention all mexican people -- will agree that it &apos;s not difficult to love mexico .
but no one can kill the spirit of true mexicans .
if you figure out what up and down really are , it &apos;s a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything , but then you add in sideways .
and you could play with the rhythm .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
there &apos;s a piece that i recently developed which was all about that , a moment . and what i do as a creative artist is i develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects .
i always drove motorcycles . and when i bought my first car , it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents &apos; house . interesting .
the next piece that i &apos;m going to do -- which is the cylinders piece , if you want to get that up -- it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago , which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs . i love ceramics and all of that .
and so thinking back , i was thinking those of us in silicon valley were really focused on products or objects -- certainly technological objects .
so , prada new york : we were asked by rem koolhaas and oma to help us conceive the technology that &apos;s in their retail store in new york .
there &apos;s lots of room , so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved .
so this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time .
the fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself underwater . ) and the last thing i &apos;ll talk about is approtec , which is a project that i &apos;m very excited about .
everything , i would say . everything that matters except every thing and except matter .
and on the photograph , he wrote with a flourish , &quot; to horse face , with love from geoffrey dickens , m.p. &quot;
interesting . i &apos;m , as you can guess , not a materialist , i &apos;m an immaterialist .
because that &apos;s where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are .
electricity , you can &apos;t see that .
the first is ludwig wittgenstein who said , &quot; i don &apos;t know why we are here .
what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space .
so you have five million , that is , five million authors and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit .
what you &apos;re seeing is year by year frequency of &quot; thrived &quot; and &quot; throve &quot; over time .
we can say , &quot; well how fast does the bubble burst ? &quot;
here &apos;s a simple way to do it .
why can everyone do it ?
google has started to digitize 15 million books .
most people are entirely unconscious of these filters .
we &apos;re becoming desensitized .
it &apos;s a waltz .
that &apos;s why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill .
it was consistent .
a couple months later , i was in manhattan , and i tweeted for a crash pad , and at midnight , i &apos;m ringing a doorbell on the lower east side , and it occurs to me i &apos;ve never actually done this alone .
right at this same time , i &apos;m signing and hugging after a gig , and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $ 10 bill , and he says , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , i burned your cd from a friend . &quot;
because they weren &apos;t with us on the sidewalk , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd , an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them .
then i went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street to say , &quot; they exist . &quot;
slim and his friends went through the country and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere to show the diversity in the country .
education is so essential .
street artist jr made a wish in 2011 : join me in a worldwide photo project to show the world its true face . now , a year after his prize wish , he shows how giant posters of human faces , pasted in public , are connecting communities , making change , and turning the world inside out . you can join in at &amp; lt ; a href = &quot; http : / / www.insideoutproject.net / &quot; &amp; gt ; insideoutproject.net &amp; lt ; / a &amp; gt ;
and he wrote a story basically saying , well , this is all well and good , but you know what , we don &apos;t know diddley squat about brains and no one has a clue how these things work , so don &apos;t believe what anyone tells you .
one is -- the most basic one is -- people like to know things .
and theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences .
it &apos;s got a lot of cells in it too , right ?
do you feel like you &apos;re moving a thousand miles an hour ?
maybe you &apos;re scratching yourself , or picking your nose , i don &apos;t know , but you &apos;re not doing anything right now , but you &apos;re being intelligent ; you &apos;re understanding what i &apos;m saying .
and on top of it , we have this memory system called the neocortex .
it may take a second to figure out what it was , but something happened .
what &apos;s the fourth one ? that &apos;s how we test it . it &apos;s all about prediction .
it &apos;s an automatic playback . and prediction of future inputs is the desired output .
and i &apos;m most excited about how we &apos;re going to use them in science .
i certainly support the start vote .
i think what we need is action . &quot;
working for peace is very creative .
that &apos;s what i got stuck doing -- the landmine campaign .
she was mesmerized .
and there &apos;s nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma .
but the main concern for the environmentally-interested students -- and they are right -- is about the future .
but until they have the same energy consumption per person , they shouldn &apos;t give advice to others -- what to do and what not to do .
thank you steel mill .
by the time the subject reached the last page on the survey , the page had been dynamically updated with the 10 best matching photos which the recognizer had found , and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo .
imagine that you are the h.r. director of a certain organization , and you receive résumés , and you decide to find more information about the candidates .
so in yet another experiment , this one with students , we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior , including pretty sensitive questions , such as this one .
which brings me back to the garden of eden .
alessandro acquisti : why privacy matters
and the fact is , people learn from people they love .
and so the kids are raised in a certain way , jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure -- sat prep , oboe , soccer practice .
the second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking .
but i think this research shows that the british enlightenment , or the scottish enlightenment , with david hume , adam smith , actually had a better handle on who we are -- that reason is often weak , our sentiments are strong , and our sentiments are often trustworthy .
time magazine asked americans , &quot; are you in the top one percent of earners ? &quot;
and then the final thing i &apos;ll mention is something you might call limerence .
i &apos;m talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation , the third-largest organized crime , a $ 10 billion industry .
yes , there were eight men who defiled me , raped me , but that didn &apos;t go into my consciousness .
and we are silent about them .
she earns around 12,000 rupees .
but it is not nice to bring them to our homes .
i &apos;m asking you to help them , accept as human beings -- not as philanthropy , not as charity , but as human beings who deserve all our support .
for one thing , i just do not do uniforms .
it &apos;s steampunk . what we have is an electric velocipede .
so , it &apos;s not that we have good words and bad words .
i think we should study all the words , because when you think about words , you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts .
that &apos;s 500,000 more words . so that &apos;s a lot .
for instance , there &apos;s ebird , where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings .
you know , it &apos;s pretty to look at for a while , but then it dies .
is the beloved paper dictionary doomed to extinction ? in this infectiously exuberant talk , leading lexicographer erin mckean looks at the many ways today &apos;s print dictionary is poised for transformation .
and what was really most exciting -- and i think richard wurman discovered this at least 20 years before i did -- was that all this stuff is connected .
the time scale on which ted operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines .
the police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial , and when steve titus was put on trial for rape , the rape victim got on the stand and said , &quot; i &apos;m absolutely positive that &apos;s the man . &quot;
i study the opposite : when they remember , when they remember things that didn &apos;t happen or remember things that were different from the way they really were .
and as part of this training exercise , these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive , hostile , physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes and later on they have to try to identify the person who conducted that interrogation .
well , to my surprise , when i published this work and began to speak out against this particular brand of psychotherapy , it created some pretty bad problems for me : hostilities , primarily from the repressed memory therapists , who felt under attack , and by the patients whom they had influenced .
i mean , another way to think about this is , which would you rather have , a kid with obesity , diabetes , shortened lifespan , all the things that go with it , or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory ?
before this switch was thrown , we didn &apos;t have in-car navigation systems giving turn-by-turn directions , because back then , gps couldn &apos;t tell you what block you were on , let alone what street .
imagine what we could do with a world full of gps dots .
we then talked about her coming to my lab and us performing a radio sweep of her car , but i wasn &apos;t even sure that would work , given that some of these devices are configured to only transmit when they &apos;re inside safe zones or when the car is moving .
some call it &quot; the invisible utility . &quot;
i remember vividly the week it all came together .
i hold out hope that we &apos;ll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of , some yet uninvented technology .
and so i made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as an email .
and we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
and it very slowly , over a few minutes , sort of painfully goes up , and then it gains momentum and it looks like it &apos;s almost about to fall .
so those who are &quot; yes , &quot; raise your hand . &quot; for . &quot;
and so far there are only three major sources of that -- coal and gas , hydro-electric , which in most places is maxed-out -- and nuclear .
when you add all these things up -- saul griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take to get 13 clean terawatts of energy from wind , solar and biofuels , and that area would be roughly the size of the united states , an area he refers to as &quot; renewistan . &quot;
so my premise here is that nuclear energy puts out more carbon dioxide , puts out more air pollutants , enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up than real renewable energy systems , namely wind , solar , geothermal power , hydro-tidal wave power .
well , right now in the united states , 50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution , and vehicles are about 25,000 of those .
for example , cellulosic ethanol , to power the entire u.s. vehicle fleet , this is how much land you would need .
and i want two of each for the mics .
and i want to support stewart brand &apos;s position .
however , there &apos;s a basic arithmetic problem here .
and just now in england they had a cold spell .
ooooh .
it became part of us , and we believed in it .
fool me once ...
now here are the facts .
compare that with the ruling elites in both developed and developing countries , i think you &apos;ll find the party being near the top in upward mobility .
in essence , the organization department runs a modernized version of china &apos;s centuries-old mentoring system .
ninety-three percent of china &apos;s generation y are optimistic about their country &apos;s future .
income per capita will be near the top of all developing countries .
thank you . thank you . thank you . thanks .
because , by western definitions , a so-called civil society has to be separate or even in opposition to the political system , but that concept is alien for chinese culture .
in fact , the greatest wealth . if you think about these other asteroids , there &apos;s a class of the nickel iron , which in platinum-group metal markets alone are worth something like 20 trillion dollars , if you can go out and grab one of these rocks .
the difficulty is getting there , and clearly , the cost to orbit is key .
today &apos;s commercial markets worldwide , global commercial launch market ?
we &apos;ve had a lot of accomplishments and it &apos;s been a tremendous success .
if you have a matching grant , it &apos;s typically two or three to one .
we &apos;re going after an orbital prize .
unicef thinks that that &apos;s good news because the figure has been steadily coming down from 12 million in 1990 . that is good .
no one , not andrew carnegie , not john d. rockefeller , has ever given as much to charity as each one of these three , and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is highly effective .
he was a student at princeton in philosophy and math , actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis last year when he graduated .
possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of asteroids that might collide with us , but actually to deflect them .
that started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys . &quot;
if we abstract this process , and simplify it as much as possible , then we could start with a single sheet of paper , one surface , and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces .
in general , if we make a small change to the folding ratio , which is what you &apos;re seeing here , then the form changes correspondingly .
and unlike traditional architecture , it &apos;s a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail .
there &apos;s a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical .
but look what happened in the course of that century .
you weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail .
it &apos;s called hutchinson-gilford progeria , and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging .
so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4,000 that are waiting for answers .
suppose we could do this instead on human cells .
i think it &apos;ll be the goal of the poets and the muppets and the surfers and the bankers and all the other people who join this stage and think about what we &apos;re trying to do here and why it matters .
in fact , research has shown that the more the world is flat , if i use tom friedman &apos;s analogy , or global , the more and more people are wanting to be different .
it &apos;s a natural component for bringing people together , discussing ideas -- in the same way we &apos;re doing here at ted .
we will open the museum in a few days , and i welcome all of you to get on qatar airways and come and join us .
sm : going back to straddling between east and west , last month we had our second doha tribeca film festival here in doha .
we all seem to think that , you know , if we look down on the ground , there &apos;s nothing there .
and walked off . and i didn &apos;t expect that , because i expected one of these ...
my mother told me to take it smaller .
and i had to make them square .
i noticed that the house was occupied .
i experimented with a -- i found a dead fly .
in america they say a period stop .
this one , i would say , was a serious challenge .
and the whole thing is sort of symmetrical .
and these doctors or these masters , these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition , refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies .
when he says , &quot; i am the spirit , and i am the way , &quot; and when the prophet muhammad said , &quot; whoever has seen me has seen god , &quot; it is because they became so much an instrument of god , they became part of god &apos;s team -- so that god &apos;s will was manifest through them , and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos .
for what defines humanity , perhaps biologically , is our physiology , but god defines humanity by our spirituality , by our nature .
well , at some point , all children become aware of death .
you take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects , and you remind one group that they &apos;re going to die but not the other , then you compare their behavior .
but the idea that science can cure death is just one more chapter in the story of the magical elixir , a story that is as old as civilization .
woody allen , for example , who said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen .
it makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers , whether before your birth or after your death .
i hosted a television show by that name on pbs .
&quot; i believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives , &quot; i wrote these men .
so we decided that we needed a set of rules , and we came up with a number .
and i got to the end -- he was crying and i was crying -- and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and if you did see the sanjay special , you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis .
people were incredibly drawn .
he &apos;s about five-foot three and a half on a good day , standing fully upright in cowboy boots .
you nearly fall with one leg , then you catch yourself with the other .
i want you to live . &quot;
he was born three and a half months premature , and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive .
now , along -- derek and i met when he was four and a half years old , and at first , derek , i thought you were mad , to be honest , because when you played the piano , you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard , and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way .
it &apos;s no use having that kind of raw ability without the technique , and luckily , derek , you decided that , once we did start learning , you &apos;d let me help you learn all the scale fingerings .
and i say , &quot; no , it &apos;s not brave at all , because if you ask for something that derek doesn &apos;t know , you &apos;re invited to come and sing it first , and then he &apos;ll pick it up . &quot;
so this is one of derek &apos;s heroes .
and despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey-ness and tripodism , it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts .
and you didn &apos;t even notice it happened .
i &apos;ve been studying chimpanzees in tanzania since 1960 .
and not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves -- modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose -- the beginning of tool-making .
we know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- &quot; self &quot; as opposed to &quot; other . &quot;
so , this is a pretty grim picture .
there &apos;s little brochures all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future , i beg that you pick up that brochure .
we want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral histories .
but the kids do ask me -- and this won &apos;t take more than two minutes , i promise -- the kids say , &quot; dr. jane , do you really have hope for the future ?
jane goodall : what separates us from chimpanzees ?
so we start simple , we make some structures that may have some of these characteristics of life , and then we try to develop that to become more lifelike .
so some things that are missing is , for example , if you had a flow of energy through a system , what we &apos;d want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy in order to maintain itself , much like living systems do .
so remember , these are primitive things , so dancing protocells , that &apos;s very interesting to us .
so we &apos;re able to then see the self-assembly of these oil droplet bodies again that we &apos;ve seen previously , and the black spots inside of there represent this kind of black tar -- this diverse , very complex , organic black tar .
so by making these chemical , artificial life experiments , we hope not only to understand something fundamental about the origin of life and the existence of life on this planet , but also what possible life there could be out there in the universe . thank you .
what they are is an addition of tadpoles that are named after a local bureaucrat whose decisions affect your water quality .
there &apos;s a lot of people in manhattan are .
because , many of you will know , that the biggest pollution burden that we have on the new york , new jersey harbor right now is no longer the point sources , no longer the big polluters , no longer the ges , but that massive network of roads , &#91; those &#93; impervious surfaces , that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners or the oily hydrocarbon waste in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure washes it straight into the estuary system .
it &apos;s built as a barn raising , using open source hardware .
and i want to show you a few of the technological interfaces that have been developed under the moniker of ooz -- which is zoo backwards and without cages -- to try and reform that relationship .
when a fish swims underneath , a light goes on .
thank you .
it is beautiful , and it has long been a part of our history .
and because we make this material , we grow this leather from the ground up , we can control its properties in very interesting ways .
andras forgacs : leather and meat without killing animals
autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head .
that &apos;s a huge power-generating capability , a mobile power-generating capability .
my dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets .
she &apos;s not going to go anywhere . &quot;
our community deserved a new way of doing things .
thank you .
many people tell me that you are a photojournalist , that you are an anthropologist photographer , that you are an activist photographer .
when i was a kid , it was more than 50 percent rainforest .
we created an incredible amount of pictures , and the result -- lélia did the design of all my books , the design of all my shows . she is the creator of the shows .
a lack of oxygen in the water .
my friends , it &apos;s very easy to do . we did it , no ?
and on my weekends i would go up , just like all the other tourists , to the top of the empire state building , and i &apos;d look down on this landscape , on these ecosystems , and i &apos;d wonder , &quot; how does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals ?
so the city basically extended to city hall park .
the white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds .
here is the beaver . and here is the stream , and the aspen and the alder and the willow .
so if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th , and lex and third , maybe there was a stream in that block .
so when you &apos;re watching &quot; law and order , &quot; and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the new york court house , right into the collect pond , 400 years ago .
fill in the blanks .
and they may not want to live exactly like us .
they &apos;re actually managing to talk north americans out of driving cars , which is a pretty great thing .
how we build things can change as well .
all throughout the developing world , people are going directly to cell phones , skipping the whole landline stage .
and it &apos;s all about this question , in a very artistic and indirect kind of way .
we get so little news about the developing world that we often forget that there are literally millions of people out there struggling to change things to be fairer , freer , more democratic , less corrupt .
basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips .
i hope that that turns out to be true .
and you &apos;d think that would be a pretty big problem for a law , but congress seems not to have let that bother them too much .
taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay .
we share written things , we share images , we share audio , we share video .
you don &apos;t have millions and millions of dollars , but you can call your representatives , and you can remind them that you vote , and you can ask not to be treated like a thief , and you can suggest that you would prefer that the internet not be broken .
time warner has called and they want us all back on the couch , just consuming -- not producing , not sharing -- and we should say , &quot; no . &quot;
this is a defibrillator , and this is a device that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm , and these have saved many lives .
that software has to receive and decode the radio signal , and then figure out what to do with it , even if it &apos;s just music that it needs to play on the radio , and that software that does that decoding , if it has any bugs in it , could create a vulnerability for somebody to hack the car .
you remotely unlock the doors through the computer that controls that , start the engine , bypass anti-theft , and you &apos;ve got yourself a car .
and so the researchers asked themselves , &quot; i wonder how many times very secure , important , sensitive conversations are happening on these two-way radios where they forget to encrypt and they don &apos;t notice that they didn &apos;t encrypt ? &quot;
a human &apos;s not going to think it &apos;s the supreme might .
it changed my life .
&quot; you didn &apos;t get a government job ? &quot; i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of mahatma gandhi .
i asked a forester -- high-powered , paper-qualified expert -- i said , &quot; what can you build in this place ? &quot;
unfortunately , they &apos;re almost half german , they &apos;re so precise .
and they actually monitor and supervise 150 schools for 7,000 children .
men are restless , men are ambitious , men are compulsively mobile , and they all want a certificate .
and they haven &apos;t collapsed .
i knew which woman i would like to take .
i &apos;ll end with a quotation by mahatma gandhi .
you see 12 intelligent computer agents , the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you .
we &apos;re working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n-dimensional schrödinger equation in time .
and yet in two million years the human brain has nearly tripled in mass , going from the one-and-a-quarter pound brain of our ancestor here , habilis , to the almost three-pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears .
because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs , and a year after winning the lotto , lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives .
who are these characters who are so damn happy ?
and then finally -- you know , the best of all possible worlds -- some of you recognize this young photo of pete best , who was the original drummer for the beatles , until they , you know , sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up ringo on a tour .
we &apos;re going to give you one as your prize to take home .
the patients , bless them , say , &quot; ah , doc , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve got a memory problem ; that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
&quot; dogbert &apos;s tech support . how may i abuse you ? &quot;
so you have to give me one . you have to make a choice .
we could do it so that when you take the two pictures , you &apos;d have four days to change your mind , or we &apos;re doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it . which course would you like to be in ? &quot;
i love photography , i love rockets , and i &apos;m going to talk to you about a hobby that can scale and show you some photos that i &apos;ve taken over the years with kids like these ; kids that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry and eventually become maybe another richard branson or diamandis .
voices : it &apos;s going ballistic . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
when lexus wants to sell you a car , they &apos;re telling you a story .
i need to go to the mall , and you know your father now , he takes a nap in the afternoon , and i got to go .
&quot; i got a surprise for you , baby ! &quot;
puts it in reverse . fifty-five out of the driveway , in reverse .
&quot; you weren &apos;t there , don &apos;t start . &quot;
but you know .
well , i stood up to her .
now , when this kid says i got to look , you know .
engine &apos;s still running -- mine , not the car .
with her is a young man -- husband , brother , lover , it &apos;s not my job .
if we started today , 10 years from now , at the end of this window of opportunity , those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent .
it required that it was completely trivial : that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car , go get it , drive it .
congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world and is , again , wirelessly enabled .
these laptops , when a child opens them up , they communicate with every single child in the classroom , within that school , within that village .
we could have a coast-to-coast , free wireless communication system .
my mom left nairobi , kenya .
2008 , 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason , too .
but it turns out , i jumped on a plane , and i ended up walking a red carpet between sarah silverman and jimmy fallon and martha stewart .
i love the way that they &apos;ll stare slack-jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand , soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs .
and he even put out a book called &quot; rosey grier &apos;s needlepoint for men . &quot;
there was lasagna , there was casseroles , there was brownies , there was butter tarts , and there was pies , lots and lots of pies .
we &apos;ve got fashion magazines , house party scenes .
there &apos;s a new place in new york where the crowds are thickest -- ground zero .
your work is highly sensual , even hedonistic .
dr : yeah .
and then everyone was up on the roof , so i ran up there .
and we met with him .
he had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead .
i think this is , obviously , substantially different from anything we &apos;d ever thought about doing before , just by the nature of it .
and it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago , but perhaps isn &apos;t now , which is , not many of us love the world trade center as a piece of architecture , as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza .
but were you conscious of memorials ? the vietnam memorial ?
zzzzzzip for safety .
now , when the kid on the right doesn &apos;t get up , we know they &apos;ve had a concussion .
so how do we guarantee the safety of our kids ?
speak up also with coaching staff .
in the 17th century , a doodle was a simpleton or a fool -- as in yankee doodle .
here &apos;s the real definition : doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think .
thank you .
luckily , those patents did not exist everywhere .
this shows you a patent landscape .
the company , gilead , that holds the patents , has licensed the intellectual property to the medicines patent pool .
more importantly , he makes his money by selling these mobile recharge coupons , you know , for the prepaid subscriptions .
the main thing is a fix-it-locally culture , which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn &apos;t have to go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed .
and we took it back to this little tinkering setup of a mobile phone repair shop , and then the magic happens .
and that &apos;ll make such a huge difference on the system , because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel , often sometimes seven to 15 kilometers , sometimes by foot , to get a simple health check done , is very , very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care .
so we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the asha worker .
and i started to see the world in a whole new way , like pairs of people connected to each other .
this here shows , on the y-axis , the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and , on the x-axis , the degrees of separation between the two people .
now , i want to be very clear : we do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all .
and not only do we show them , but others can read them .
because human social networks , whenever they are mapped , always kind of look like this : the picture of the network .
and now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you -- was spreading through the network ?
and so it is not just what &apos;s happening to these people -- whether they &apos;re losing weight or gaining weight , or becoming rich or becoming poor , or becoming happy or not becoming happy -- that affects us ; it &apos;s also the actual architecture of the ties around us .
more years were added to average life expectancy in the 20th century than all years added across all prior millennia of human evolution combined .
after all , aging is not a piece of cake .
we &apos;ve asked older and younger people to view faces in laboratory studies , some frowning , some smiling .
we &apos;re more appreciative , more open to reconciliation .
and democracy was the political innovation which protected this freedom , because we were liberated from fear so that our minds in fact , whether they be despots or dogmas , could be the protagonists .
but despite our electoral mandate , the markets mistrusted us .
we were led by our fears .
let &apos;s throw democracy at the problem .
let &apos;s see if we can &apos;t design a european agora , not simply for products and services , but for our citizens , where they can work together , deliberate , learn from each other , exchange between art and cultures , where they can come up with creative solutions .
it &apos;s rather the other way -- more closed borders and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out of some of the different parts of the european construction .
being a shy , little , skinny asian kid growing up in the silicon valley with low self-esteem , those guys made me believe in something bigger .
and then another thing opens , you close that .
and that &apos;s what i want to focus on -- the one who takes the best part of the meat .
we promise that the powder river country will henceforth be closed to all whites .
communal ownership of reservation lands ends .
they were tired of ghost dances .
frequently , grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents , due to alcoholism , domestic violence and general apathy , cannot raise them .
shrugging our shoulders in the dark ?
and what it was was oral rehydration salts .
it &apos;s not even unique to poor people in india .
this machine is really strange , and one of the consequences is that people are weird .
i think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing .
how is that possible ? let &apos;s go to something else .
same thing here : you had an intuitive response to this that was very quick .
turns out , go home and do the math , the nine to 11 is a bigger change . that person has saved more gallons .
i &apos;ve been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior .
we &apos;re spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now .
sendhil , thank you so much .
but you have to have the right tools .
it &apos;s like a wall to the electricity .
annmarie thomas : hands-on science with squishy circuits
we steamed up the windows permanently , and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they &apos;ve learned into the steam in the window .
hold the hand like this , palm up .
i think it &apos;s enough with water for me . the other guys can talk about -- cheers .
yeah . thank you .
ok .
zoe : stop . lg : yeah .
here -- shortcuts . i talk about shortcuts .
when i lift the heap , i peek .
we can take some over there later . so now , i will drop the cards .
so , i use the queen , and here &apos;s five of clubs .
so now , that was the reason , right ?
and we switch this to the king .
another suit . lg : diamonds , perfect .
but it was -- did you hear ?
lg : good . good . two -- -- thank you .
so here , all the cards are face down -- you agree ?
and then , king , after exactly five seconds .
he sounds something like this .
and suddenly , the music took off . it took flight .
and then there &apos;s a very small group .
did anybody think while i was playing , &quot; why is he using so many impulses ? &quot;
now , he gets excited . that &apos;s excitement , you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
would you think of somebody who you adore , who &apos;s no longer there ?
now , i had an amazing experience . i was 45 years old , i &apos;d been conducting for 20 years , and i suddenly had a realization .
i learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz , one of the rare survivors .
so , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , take a look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of everyone we &apos;re testing here today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
that &apos;s actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks .
think about your own work .
lets go to madurai , india and test this . &quot;
around the desire to do things because they matter , because we like it , because they &apos;re interesting , because they are part of something important .
then they present all of the stuff that they &apos;ve developed to their teammates , to the rest of the company , in this wild and wooly all-hands meeting at the end of the day .
well-compensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time .
dan pink : the puzzle of motivation
i think we could roll the tape , admin .
it &apos;s made of stainless steel , quite thick .
so it &apos;s a floating island with water , fresh water , that can fly from place to place .
it can generate about a million kilowatts , in order to be bright enough to be visible in daylight .
they say , &quot; really ? how many ? &quot;
so in the for-profit sector , the more value you produce , the more money you can make .
they raised more money more quickly for these causes than any events in history , all based on the idea that people are weary of being asked to do the least they can possibly do .
well , you put those five things together -- you can &apos;t use money to lure talent away from the for-profit sector , you can &apos;t advertise on anywhere near the scale the for-profit sector does for new customers , you can &apos;t take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers that the for-profit sector takes , you don &apos;t have the same amount of time to find them as the for-profit sector , and you don &apos;t have a stock market with which to fund any of this , even if you could do it in the first place , and you &apos;ve just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for-profit sector on every level .
so we &apos;ve all been taught that charities should spend as little as possible on overhead things like fundraising under the theory that , well , the less money you spend on fundraising , the more money there is available for the cause .
that &apos;s about 300 billion dollars a year .
you know , this little office of the conductor .
so that &apos;s a sort of a tradition .
yeah , that was very short , but you could see it &apos;s a completely different figure . right ?
you &apos;re using us as instruments , not as partners .
once like a muti , and you &apos;ll -- -- clap , just once .
so it &apos;s a different kind of , a very spiritual but yet very firm control .
but of course it &apos;s not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy .
it &apos;s not feedback . it &apos;s an &quot; mmmm ... &quot; yeah , it comes from here .
but you can see the music on his face .
this bottle of oil , distilled over a hundred million years of geological time , ancient sunlight , contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor -- equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you .
if just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms , it would offset all the savings that we need to make , in carbon , over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change .
but the world isn &apos;t second life .
the idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology .
we need international legislation from copenhagen and so on .
as we see the spread of it , we see national hubs emerging .
and these budgets are the key for our future ; they &apos;re the key for our kids .
only one state says they don &apos;t have to balance the budget .
and california &apos;s not unique .
that &apos;s something i think is very , very important .
we need to take the fact that the current employees , the future liabilities they create , that should come out of the current budget .
this one entered her left hemisphere , and knocked out her broca &apos;s area , the speech center of her brain .
and on the many times i saw nathaniel on skid row , i witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments , from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode .
chris is a great friend of mine from my university days , but secretly , i hate him .
so i decided to evaluate different experiences i had in my life from the point of view of the five senses .
respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
there &apos;s also the six emotions and that elusive x-factor .
if you have kids , you know what i mean .
of course this is an infantile story , but thinking up one sentence after the next is the same thing a professional writer like me does .
there &apos;s no need .
of course , there were kids who had to .
look what i found .
some people turn into rockers like this .
however , acting majors are not supposed to act .
why we cannot be something is not important .
&quot; who is it that can tell me who i am ? &quot; -- a great line from king lear .
professor van allen told me about observations of venus , that there was intense microwave radiation .
by 15 years later , evidence of global warming was much stronger .
the biggest reservoir , the ocean , was the least well measured , until more than 3,000 argo floats were distributed around the world &apos;s ocean .
shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker , so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer .
the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use .
a large fraction of species will be committed to extinction .
i &apos;m a stunt coordinator . and as well as perform stunts i often design them .
here &apos;s a bit more .
they did it by remote control .
high falls , they &apos;re old fashioned stunts .
and that &apos;s centre point in london .
i spoke with him on the phone a few months ago .
you can just see them there , popping open .
he left the company because he saw , as some other people in the space suit industry , an emerging market for space suits for space tourists .
i &apos;m confident that we &apos;ll find one .
now each year , as new snow lands on the glacier , it melts in the summer sun , and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice , and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier , forming big networks of caves , sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock .
not long after we mapped snow dragon , brent discovered this new cave not very far away .
and this beautiful quartz crystal was also found in the back of snow dragon .
we have a huge vested interest in it , partly because it &apos;s education that &apos;s meant to take us into this future that we can &apos;t grasp .
they just switched , that was it .
i &apos;ve got two kids . he &apos;s 21 now ; my daughter &apos;s 16 .
they &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life . but they &apos;re rather curious , and i say this out of affection for them .
when i was a student , if you had a degree , you had a job .
it &apos;s really prompted by a conversation i had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of ; she &apos;s called gillian lynne -- have you heard of her ? some have . she &apos;s a choreographer and everybody knows her work .
we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we &apos;ve talked about . and the only way we &apos;ll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are . and our task is to educate their whole being , so they can face this future .
in a thick arabic accent , my brain went , &quot; berfect . &quot;
now , while preparing for the tour , i had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive .
and the lebanese , brilliant lebanese , nemr abou nassar , we featured in our first tour , has just been performing in l.a. &apos; s legendary comedy clubs .
thank you .
third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
i work for the federal government .
but look at this closely and you can see that actually they &apos;ve crossed a different threshold .
and then in 2003 i started parikrma humanity foundation from my kitchen table .
my god ! what a bonding exercise that was .
and again , there were people who laughed at me and said , &quot; don &apos;t be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students .
more than 90 percent of our non-teaching staff are all parents and extended families .
they are really excelling .
he can tell you stories in english of the thirsty crow , of the crocodile and of the giraffe .
and he graduated with his doctorate from harvard , and he set up a little consulting shop in white plains , new york .
you should be looking for the perfect pepsis . &quot;
there are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain ; there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy ; and there are people who like it extra chunky .
but you will never , ever say to someone who asks you what you want that &quot; i want a milky , weak coffee . &quot;
for the longest time in the food industry , there was a sense that there was one way , a perfect way , to make a dish .
and for that , we owe him a great vote of thanks .
you don &apos;t have the pustules or the redness and inflammation .
every single one of you has it , because you have the risk factor for it , which is being alive .
but everyone is responsible .
of the five senses , vision is the one that i appreciate the most , and it &apos;s the one that i can least take for granted .
which , incidentally , makes me the opposite of dean kamen , because i &apos;m a comic book artist , son of an inventor , and he &apos;s an inventor , son of a comic book artist .
what it comes down to , really , is four basic principles : learn from everyone , follow no one , watch for patterns , and work like hell .
vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage , as well .
the distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny , the penny marshall to the marshall plan to &quot; plan 9 &quot; to nine lives : it &apos;s all the same .
but even though we &apos;re only experiencing it one piece at a time , that &apos;s just where the technology is right now .
and whether it &apos;s the opening line from &quot; one hundred years of solitude &quot; or the fantastical stream of consciousness in &quot; autumn of the patriarch , &quot; where the words rush by , page after page of unpunctuated imagery sweeping the reader along like some wild river twisting through a primal south american jungle , reading márquez is a visceral experience .
what i want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives -- comedy as the philosopher &apos;s stone .
his intent is to be funny .
there are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol than the perfect punchline .
but back in 2009 , the question joel and i kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address climate change were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science .
caroline lavelle : casting a spell on the cello
washington , d.c. is solemn .
i find it &apos;s actually getting really hard to be serious .
and that kind of passion drove me into very serious play , a kind of play i could never do now because i &apos;m too well-educated .
and the public theater actually had much better advertising than this .
the best way to accomplish serious design -- which i think we all have the opportunity to do -- is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job .
and we did . and it was play .
that was the play part of the job .
and then this funny thing happened .
well , philip anderson may have been right .
it &apos;s as if , as they were growing , they just forgot the tail part .
now i don &apos;t know how you &apos;d feed a child like that but -- we don &apos;t know how fast the molas grow in the wild , but captive growth studies at the monterey bay aquarium -- one of the first places to have them in captivity -- they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months .
so what are we trying to find out ? we &apos;re focusing on the pacific .
and everything from the kidney , to the testes , to the back bone , to the fin muscle to -- i think that ís pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten .
so rather than just being some sunbathing slacker , they &apos;re really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature .
leds are smaller , they &apos;re cheaper , they &apos;re longer lasting , they &apos;re more efficient .
this piece , actually , will be on display down in the sierra simulcast lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show .
usman riaz is a 21-year-old whiz at the percussive guitar , a style he learned to play by watching his heroes on youtube . the fellow plays onstage at tedglobal 2012 -- followed by a jawdropping solo from the master of percussive guitar , preston reed . and watch these two guitarists take on a very spur-of-the-moment improv .
and so it transpired that a horse was killed , a god was made sin-free , a brahmin &apos;s ego was appeased , a woman ... was ruined , and a one-eyed monkey was left ...
for me it came very early .
so , why aren &apos;t governments blaring this on television ?
here , father , your eight-times folded cotton sari .
too small for detection , it &apos;s your built-in protection .
and unless this is actually internalized , it won &apos;t happen .
and if somebody answers , that shall be my wish . &quot;
he built this machine , and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works , with these little bits . and it &apos;s an idea that goes way back .
such a computer would open up universes , which are , at the present , outside the range of any instruments .
they were real soldering-gun type guys , and they actually built this thing .
what &apos;s code , what &apos;s hardware ?
&quot; here lies mouse . born : ? . died : 4 : 50 a.m. , may 1953 . &quot;
he &apos;s still ahead of some of the stuff that &apos;s being done now .
every time there was a new , fast machine , he started using it , and saw exactly what &apos;s happening now .
we &apos;ve been doing that since , you know , since we started pcr and synthesizing small strings of dna .
aunties , uncles , you can continue to put your hands up , aunties and uncles as well .
in 10 years , it &apos;s set to double : 300 billion dollars a year .
stacy does her best , but she &apos;s third-generation as well ; she was never taught to cook at home or in school .
fast food has taken over the whole country ; we know that .
but i &apos;m killing them .
and the way i look at it is : if you don &apos;t have knives and forks in your school , you &apos;re purely endorsing , from a state level , fast food , because it &apos;s handheld .
they &apos;ll be having two bottles . ok ?
so , supermarkets .
if you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
the problem is they all want to roll out what they &apos;re doing to the next school , and the next , but there &apos;s no cash .
but interestingly , they have a sense of humor .
and unfortunately , for mortals like you and me , we probably can &apos;t understand it very well .
but what about the real cybercriminals ?
and he said that he had so much money stashed in his upper-east side apartment at one point that he just didn &apos;t know what to do with it and actually fell into a depression .
max vision , aka iceman -- mastermind of cardersmarket .
and baron-cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills , and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities and skills because they have lost their way socially or been duped .
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller , mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more , and living in detached buildings , you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of .
the reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now : the baby boomers retiring -- and then there &apos;s a gap , generation x , which is a small generation .
this was a little grocery store , a food lion grocery store , that is now a public library .
today , the transit , the main street and the new housing have all been built .
it &apos;s very successful , and it &apos;s helped to prompt -- eight of the 13 regional malls in denver have now , or have announced plans to be , retrofitted .
and the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit .
their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia , but they &apos;re less diverse than cities .
&quot; looking at your vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; is a full day &apos;s work . &quot;
we were having a conversation about menopause , and we got onto the subject of her vagina -- which you &apos;ll do if you &apos;re talking about menopause .
and i wanted to stop doing the &quot; vagina monologues &quot; because it felt too daunting . i felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events , but doesn &apos;t intervene on their behalf .
what has also happened is in the course of these travels -- and it &apos;s been an extraordinary thing -- is that every single place that i have gone to in the world , i have met a new species .
there &apos;s a woman named esther chavez who i met in juarez , mexico . and esther chavez was a brilliant accountant in mexico city ; she was 72 years old ; and she was planning to retire .
but , being a vagina warrior , she kept going , and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness .
it &apos;s not a typical mindset for most americans , but it is perforce typical of virtually all hungarians .
in those early days of the final solution , it was handcrafted brutality ; people were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river .
he had installed the heavy equipment for his new process in an abandoned store in the vicinity of kings mountain , and for two months these 16 men would live and work together , mastering the new process .
and just as clearly , it is saying , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
but they did , they did like each other .
he said , &quot; it &apos;s a what ? &quot;
and in about 1997 , the then-director philippe de montebello gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 . we normally have these very long lead-in times .
it wasn &apos;t just your standard installation .
they know what they &apos;re looking for .
there is no government to protect them .
as my mother said , we are the future hope , and the men are only killing in somalia .
and i thought , maybe i can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist .
that &apos;s the best part .
i &apos;m going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72 percent of the planet , so buckle up .
i believe in just enriching the economy .
we went down into the rift valley .
but the only logical &#91; explanation &#93; was that there were hot springs .
so , we wanted to accelerate this process .
you &apos;re looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs .
this ship sank 1,500 years ago .
we can then build a command center .
why do we have programs to build habitation on mars , and we have programs to look at colonizing the moon , but we do not have a program looking at how we colonize our own planet ?
tom friedman , in his recent new york times article , captured , in the way that no one else could , the spirit behind our effort .
dan jurafsky : does lufthansa serve breakfast and san jose ? well , that sounds funny .
you can break up the material , for example , into these short , modular units of eight to 12 minutes , each of which represents a coherent concept .
now , how do you grade the work of 100,000 students if you do not have 10,000 tas ?
and the really amazing thing is , because there were so many students , it means that even if a student posed a question at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , somewhere around the world , there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem .
personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well , because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30-year-old problem .
so let &apos;s go back even further , to plutarch , who said that , &quot; the mind is not a vessel that needs filling , but wood that needs igniting . &quot;
because it &apos;s like the stage is an optical illusion , for some reason .
&quot; surviving the slammer : do &apos;s and don &apos;ts . &quot;
emily levine : richard . what did i say ?
you make yourself the active voice .
so this whole subject-object thing has relevance to humor in this way .
and it was like being psychoanalyzed .
&quot; no , you take the prize .
i love connections .
and the mother goes through a second red light .
and thank you for inviting me into it .
we are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago .
remember , we &apos;ve only been an advanced civilization -- an industrial civilization , if you would -- for 200 years .
somewhere in the amazon forest is the marginal tree .
i hope they &apos;re right .
number five , one of my favorites : reversal of the earth &apos;s magnetic field .
there &apos;s a flip side to it . in studying stars like our sun , we &apos;ve found that they go through periods of diminishment , when their total amount of energy that &apos;s expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent .
you know , you go to a restaurant , you eat fish , i got news for you , it &apos;s all farmed . you know , you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it &apos;s a wild fish , cause they &apos;re not going to tell you . we &apos;re giving away the code .
i don &apos;t have a good answer for this one .
we finally have , just in the last year , the technology to stop this cold .
we know about this stuff .
there are a few key points .
so the complexity of this system that we &apos;re looking at , the one driven by the sun -- upper portion , mostly -- and the lower portion is partly driven by the input from heat below and by other processes .
seconds after this video was taken , people in beijing , people in sydney , people in amsterdam , people in washington d.c. were watching this .
it &apos;s a new world .
climate change , ocean acidification , dissolved oxygen , carbon cycle , coastal upwelling , fishing dynamics -- the full spectrum of earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume .
we &apos;re about to ride the wave of technological opportunity .
when earthquakes take place , massive amounts of these new microbes we &apos;ve never seen before come out of the sea floor .
oceanographer john delaney is leading the team that is building an underwater network of high-def cameras and sensors that will turn our ocean into a global interactive lab -- sparking an explosion of rich data about the world below .
it &apos;s not , perhaps , the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners .
and i think that &apos;s also part of life .
i think that is the progress of cities .
and as wondrous as it is , it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification that we have often come to be admired .
unexpected versus habitual .
so i believe that my main interest is to memory .
world without risk would not be worth living .
it &apos;s political . there is so many parties to this project .
not just for new york , but for the world .
the question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport ?
then we &apos;ve got the model s , which starts at around 50,000 dollars .
em : well , as i mentioned earlier , we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption , so i &apos;m quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar .
so that seems like a win for the consumer .
you decided to build a space company .
em : since our primary competitors are national governments , the enforceability of patents is questionable .
so progress on this &quot; let &apos;s make it reusable , &quot; how is that going ? that was just a simulation video we saw .
through most of our life , we get through life by reasoning by analogy , which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations .
and in the center of kunene region is the village of sesfontein . this is where i was born .
i was born in 1971 .
joshua kangombe saw what was happening : wildlife disappearing , poaching was skyrocketing , and the situation seemed very hopeless .
the second element is that we wanted to have a life , a better life where we can benefit through many things .
the black rhino -- they were almost extinct in 1982 .
john kasaona : how poachers became caretakers
what &apos;s the context of this meal ?
this is an easy sell .
but it &apos;s not all about the seafood .
put it on four plates .
there &apos;s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world .
they are powered by the sun . solar panels power them .
we &apos;ve done films . we &apos;ve done books . we have more coming .
we &apos;re now at the columbia glacier in alaska .
these changes in the alpine world are accelerating .
on up to iceland .
the interior of greenland is to the right .
because i believe we have an opportunity right now .
it turned out , in every single case , they came out of the indian educational system .
process innovation is different from product innovation .
india has the youngest growing population in the world .
there were many epidemics there .
and i really didn &apos;t know what i would do , but friends of mine began telling me about children shooting other children with guns .
this reminded me of clustering that we &apos;d seen also in infectious epidemics , for example cholera .
and then a bunch of community activities for changing norms .
so anyway , additionally , there was still this problem , and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems .
&quot; on the other hand , i don &apos;t have to get up at four every single morning to milk my labrador . &quot;
no , feel free to follow along on your blackberries or your iphones if you &apos;ve got them .
rives : wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
but if he were here -- he might remind us , as he does in the wrap-up to his fine autobiography , that on this day bill clinton began a journey -- a journey that saw him go on to become the first democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades .
they begin to be attracted towards earth .
and we can see them dividing throughout .
what we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups -- so the chemotherapy treated group and the tumor treating field group -- was the same .
there &apos;s none of the tiredness .
her cancer continued to grow .
it receives the least rainfall in the country , lowest rainfall .
they collect 100 thousand liters in one season .
but they can be opened for ted people .
this town was established 800 years ago .
but the nearest would be &quot; glory , &quot; a reputation .
it is a structure for maintain , for centuries , by generations , without any department , without any funding , so the secret is &quot; &#91; unclear &#93; , &quot; respect .
so , look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater , and also create something through a tire from a jet plane , and used in a camel cart .
anupam mishra : the ancient ingenuity of water harvesting
again , in the west , we have private sector debt of 200 percent of gdp in spain , the u.k. , and the u.s .
and they &apos;re looking at africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade out to 2050 .
because what people want is what politicians try , they don &apos;t always succeed , but they try and deliver .
because the question really is , what happens next ?
and that tells me this : that africa is going to go from a $ 2 trillion economy today to a $ 29 trillion economy by 2050 .
so that &apos;s why i &apos;ve always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours .
so you may wonder , why on earth are they doing it ?
i &apos;ll just give you a very short list of reasons why authoritarian deliberation may actually help the dictators .
now it &apos;s all available online .
i &apos;ve later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men , better known as the &quot; man box . &quot;
i think back to my father .
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good .
there ain &apos;t no first time .
and they asked me how was it , and i say to them , &quot; it was good , &quot; and i zip my pants up in front of them , and i head for the door .
and i just don &apos;t think that &apos;s what india &apos;s all about , or should be all about .
and of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they &apos;re seen .
but what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones .
she &apos;s illiterate , so she can &apos;t read the french subtitles .
as a student in the mid &apos; 70s , i knew what the image of india was then , if there was an image at all .
but , the issue is that when i talked about that example , it &apos;s not just about talking about india , it &apos;s not propaganda .
we have to overcome our poverty . we have to deal with the hardware of development , the ports , the roads , the airports , all the infrastructural things we need to do , and the software of development , the human capital , the need for the ordinary person in india to be able to have a couple of square meals a day , to be able to send his or her children to a decent school , and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves .
so after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources i had , i went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . it &apos;s actually available on the market .
actually our body doesn &apos;t hate these .
this thing can be stuck , like that little green triangle up there , sort of symbolizing this right now .
it is the process by which animals de-animate , appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed .
the next day , she was doing so well , they wanted to run tests on her .
and so , we were thinking about that , about this relationship between these things , and thinking about whether or not that &apos;s what happened to the skier .
so , i thought , &quot; wow , i have to get some of this . &quot;
and one of the things we wondered -- i &apos;m sure some of you out there are economists , and you know all about supply and demand .
and also the wonderful scientists and businesspeople at ikaria .
but darwin shows that it &apos;s just false .
the term is owed to niko tinbergen , who did his famous experiments with gulls , where he found that that orange spot on the gull &apos;s beak -- if he made a bigger , oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder .
he &apos;s a computer scientist , reginald adams a psychologist , and there i am , and we &apos;re putting this together into a book .
we pay taxes , we vote occasionally , we watch the men and women we choose rule rule more or less without us .
mayor nutter of philadelphia said , we could never get away here in philadelphia with the stuff that goes on in washington , the paralysis , the non-action , the inaction .
imagine david cameron wandering around the united kingdom asking , &quot; how am i doing ? &quot; he wouldn &apos;t like the answer .
they came , they stayed , and they found ways and are still finding ways to work together , city-to-city , and through inter-city organizations .
we can create not a league of nations , which failed , but a league of cities , not a united or a dis-united nations , but united cities of the world .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens every time , every time you do this with adults .
don &apos;t know what they do with that , but they have one .
we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important .
even one like , say , tickle me elmo -- which , despite its ingenuity , really only does one thing , whereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices .
mckim published a paper in 1966 , describing an experiment that he and his colleagues conducted to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity .
and they experimented with plywood for many years without necessarily having one single goal in mind .
at ideo there &apos;s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel sometimes about the environment .
some of it &apos;s embarrassment and some of it is because they just don &apos;t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid .
so when a kid dresses up as a firefighter , you know , he &apos;s beginning to try on that identity .
and if we &apos;re running design studios we need to be able to figure out , how can we transition designers through these different experiences ?
but then i stopped , because i figured , &quot; oh , you know , i made it .
he said , &quot; no . but it can buy prozac . &quot;
richard st. john : success is a continuous journey
the most transformative experience i &apos;ve ever had -- in that single moment , hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing , people together , the shared vision .
and lo and behold , people started uploading their videos .
i &apos;ll stop it there in the interest of time .
from malta , madagascar , thailand , vietnam , jordan , egypt , israel , as far north as alaska and as far south as new zealand .
this will be a premiere today .
and obviously intentions are not the only thing , so here is another example for one of these applications .
it demands that we optimize ourselves , that we control ourselves , that we self-manage continuously because that &apos;s the only way in which such a liberal society works .
but really it means excellence .
a good life -- a life that you say you as a designer consent to by saying , &quot; in the good life , goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair .
now the students and i enjoyed the class , but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern , the teaching technology isn &apos;t .
one student wrote , &quot; now i &apos;m seeing bayes networks and examples of game theory everywhere i look . &quot;
they got this statement of accomplishment .
and he lives in the sand , and he catches things that go by overhead .
so this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second , and i &apos;m playing it back at 15 . and so this is slowed down 333 times .
it &apos;s a very beautiful structure .
so the next and final question was , well , how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if they &apos;re able to break open snails ?
here &apos;s that same orientation that we saw earlier .
that &apos;s the smashing part of the heel on both these images , and it gets worn away . in fact , i &apos;ve seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh .
and when you listen to some of the presentations here -- and the extraordinary range of human capability , our understandings -- and then you contrast it with the fact we still call this planet , &quot; earth : &quot; it &apos;s pretty extraordinary -- we have one foot in the dark ages .
because it &apos;s a problem we have .
fish do not sit in seats .
she gets about that close and then she pulls away .
but after that encounter i really did want to go back with that animal and dance .
now , we evolved in rather more challenging times than these , in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws .
first , of course , they killed some of the deer , but that wasn &apos;t the major thing .
well , it &apos;s a stupid excuse , but it sort of kind of makes sense , doesn &apos;t it , because you &apos;d think that whales eat huge amounts of fish and krill , so obviously take the whales away , there &apos;ll be more fish and krill .
and the opportunities for this are developing more rapidly than you might think possible .
isn &apos;t it an amazing thought that every time you wander into a park or down an avenue or through a leafy street , you can see the shadows of these great beasts ?
so we need new stories , new heroes and new tools .
here we are , back to our hero , the oyster .
so we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project .
and the second one is : when can we eat the oysters ?
and so , in fact , they concocted a couple of early , you know , founding public-health interventions in the system of the city , one of which was called the &quot; nuisances act , &quot; which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river .
he found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick .
so an entire philosophy , a body of knowledge about the natural world that had been empirically gleaned over centuries , goes away .
so , two months later , i went into tibet , and i started interviewing the people there , taking my photographs . that &apos;s what i do .
so this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons .
i wanted him to get an experience in the islamic world and i also wanted him to -- i was going there to work with a group , do a story on a group called the kalash , that are a group of animists , 3,000 animists , that live -- very small area -- surrounded by islam -- there &apos;s 3,000 of these kalash left ; they &apos;re incredible people .
and this is in peru , where the kids told the story about a river that they cleaned up .
this is an old mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather .
it &apos;s a very large number of galaxies .
you see the whole big picture ?
so let me show you some of nature &apos;s patterns that are the result of this .
it &apos;s hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience , it &apos;s hard to see the pattern of this .
it should be called invisible matter , but the dark matter we &apos;ve made visible .
and so you know when you first saw this picture , it didn &apos;t mean quite so much to you .
and then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on .
since then we &apos;ve had wmap , which just gives us higher angular resolution .
and this is an extraordinary thing , right ?
so i quit my degree , i headed off to the himalayas , i became a monk , and i started studying meditation .
it &apos;s a very uncomfortable way to live life , when you get this tight and stressed .
that &apos;s the potential of meditation , of mindfulness .
at the time , i was finishing up school , and i was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies .
so for six days , i lived in front of a webcam .
because embracing the shake for me wasn &apos;t just about art and having art skills .
and then we unplugged .
why does this matter ?
we get to edit , and that means we get to delete , and that means we get to retouch , the face , the voice , the flesh , the body -- not too little , not too much , just right .
and one day i came in and a woman who had lost a child was talking to a robot in the shape of a baby seal .
these days , those phones in our pockets are changing our minds and hearts because they offer us three gratifying fantasies .
it &apos;s as though we &apos;re using them as spare parts to support our fragile sense of self .
technology is making a bid to redefine human connection -- how we care for each other , how we care for ourselves -- but it &apos;s also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction .
and i did know how the alumni of various schools back in the 30s judged coaches and athletic teams .
there are some things that helped me , i think , be better than i would have been . i know i &apos;m not what i ought to be , not what i should be . but i think i &apos;m better than i would have been if i hadn &apos;t run across certain things .
so that was the ideas that i tried to get across to the youngsters under my supervision .
that &apos;s my job . i &apos;m paid to do it . pitifully poor , but i am paid to do it .
i &apos;d never seen that before , but he did .
that &apos;s what really matters : if you make effort to do the best you can regularly , the results will be about what they should be .
i mention in my book , &quot; they call me coach . &quot;
in fact , in the last 10 years , the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled , while in the same time , the actual number of transplants has barely gone up .
plus we have stem cells .
we then take a scaffold , a biomaterial -- again , looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt -- we then shape that material , and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time -- very much like baking a layer cake , if you will .
and there &apos;s a 3d elevator that then actually goes down one layer at a time each time the printhead goes through .
so while we &apos;ve been talking today , you can actually see the printer back here in the back stage .
i became the captain of the team , and that was great .
i pulled them aside .
so in other words , what &apos;s happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company &apos;s sugar rush problem , a problem the economists call &quot; the coincidence of wants , &quot; in approximately 60 seconds .
i mean , it &apos;s amazing to think that , in every single minute of this speech , 25 hours of youtube video will be loaded .
so my co-author , roo rogers , and i have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption .
yet , that car sits idle for 23 hours a day .
we &apos;ve gone from traditional car-ownership to car-sharing companies , such as zipcar and goget , to ride-sharing platforms that match rides to the newest entry , which is peer-to-peer car rental , where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day to your neighbor .
stayed when everybody else was dropping out .
so , this was told to me in a setup of elders .
caitria o &apos;neill : that was me in front of our house in monson , massachusetts last june .
why ? it had to be done . we found pastor bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure .
so this is what filled our days .
disaster relief is essentially a backwards political campaign .
chris and bill have volunteered their time to use operations and partnerships .
but if you give locals the tools , if you show them what they can do to recover , they become experts .
so , these are the cities of the future , and we have to engage them .
i thought they might be playing king of the hill , but i was wrong .
and then you get sultanbelyi , in turkey , where it &apos;s even built to a higher level of design .
this here , on the right-hand side , is what &apos;s called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- it &apos;s a hotel .
you &apos;re allowed to have an elected government , collect taxes , provide municipal services , and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
little did i know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true .
but think of it . these men , who hadn &apos;t had the educational opportunities i &apos;d had , helped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law by their dedicated help .
and his machine , which was as big as a washing machine , was launched on the 13th of january , 1976 .
do you love being read to ?
it &apos;s something that a group of countries and the world blind union are advocating , a cross-border treaty so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception , we can transport those books across borders and give life to people , particularly in developing countries , blind people who don &apos;t have the books to read .
the average lifespan &apos;s more than doubled since 1840 , and it &apos;s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day .
and one final thing . wish people like me luck , okay ?
how can we possibly give each student even one hour a week of one-on-one attention ? &quot;
let &apos;s sell pirate supplies . &quot; this is the pirate supply store .
she took over as executive director .
they &apos;re allowed to go home at 5 : 30 p.m. , enjoy their family , enjoy other hobbies , get outside , play .
the teachers are going to tell us how we &apos;re most useful . &quot;
and this became an ongoing thing . more and more books .
and a lot of them had been former educators or would-be educators , so they combined with a lot of local designers , local writers , and they just took the idea independently and they did their own thing .
it &apos;s clearly not school , even though they &apos;re working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables , pencils and papers , whatever .
i know that for a fact . so , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
and i &apos;m very aware that when you say the word &quot; god , &quot; many people will turn off immediately .
we demand an explanation from god .
do they ? i don &apos;t feel we can sing that song again in church , after what &apos;s happened .
perhaps there is a great , cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering so that everything will work out ok in the end .
in the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life .
by seeking intimate connection with your inwardness .
and each one of those is really kind of summing up the most important things for the united states at that time .
and so the profile is sort of for your average san francisco neighborhood : a lot of young people .
so , with that little bit of technology , humans went from a small band of 10,000 or so -- the same number as neanderthals everywhere -- and we suddenly exploded . with the invention of language around 50,000 years ago , the number of humans exploded , and very quickly became the dominant species on the planet .
you put energy into the right kind of system and out comes wasted heat , entropy and extropy , which is order .
your cat wants more food .
nuclear energy , fission , is really bad idea for bombs .
so , technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket .
you see , i grew up in war-torn iraq , and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we &apos;ve only seen one side of it .
this is where we conceive of rape and casualties as inevitabilities .
there are two sides of war .
and last , but not least , we need to invest in peace and women , not only because it is the right thing to do , not only because it is the right thing to do , for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today , but it is for the future .
thank you .
now i grew up in the &apos; 60s and i &apos;ll admit it , actually , my childhood spanned the &apos; 60s , and i was a wannabe hippie and i always resented the fact that i wasn &apos;t really old enough to be a hippie .
the difference between arts and sciences is also not constructive versus deconstructive , right ? a lot of people think of the sciences as deconstructive .
and then you have artists , and you all know this is true as well , artists will say things about scientists because they say they &apos;re too concrete , they &apos;re disconnected with the world .
and this isn &apos;t really the information you need to operate in everyday life and figure out how to participate in this democracy and determine what &apos;s going on .
but that &apos;s the work i &apos;m doing with biosentient corporation trying to figure out how do we integrate these things ?
you know , there &apos;s also something called the &quot; complete idiot &apos;s guide ? &quot;
and cape cod , there are idyllic roads , and all of us can drive in this room .
and this also happened , so i have five daughters now .
the great graphic designer paul rand designed the ibm logo , the westinghouse logo .
i had clients in japan to make really complex stuff like this .
computer programs are essentially trees , and when you make art with a computer program , there &apos;s kind of a problem .
so , i wanted to play with cheetos in some way .
the ten laws and three keys -- i won &apos;t go over them because that &apos;s why i have a book , and also that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the web for free .
and i can &apos;t help but enjoy looking at everything in the world .
the mit media lab &apos;s john maeda lives at the intersection of technology and art , a place that can get very complicated . here he talks about paring down to basics .
we have work to do . and we can mobilize resources and political will . but the political will has to be mobilized , in order to mobilize the resources .
csi : climate .
this was from nature magazine . these are concentrating solar , renewable energy plants , linked in a so-called &quot; supergrid &quot; to supply all of the electrical power to europe , largely from developing countries -- high-voltage dc currents .
this was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet .
connect with people . become very active as citizens .
and so that gives me an opportunity , because every design show that i curate kind of looks at a different world . and it &apos;s great , because it seems like every time i change jobs .
and it was great , because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know , scientists would tell designers , you know , i don &apos;t know what style is , i &apos;m not really elegant .
in australia they did it -- this research company , called symbiotica .
it &apos;s only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first &quot; pretty &quot; -- if we can say so -- scientific presentations .
also , i can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans and maybe invest in this kinko &apos;s store . but it really is a big change .
we always think that robots will take care of us , and instead they designed these robots that are very , very needy .
but i &apos;m hoping that this particular exhibition will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going -- which is always , hopefully , a portrait a few years in advance of where the world is going .
and on the vertical axis you &apos;ve got the number of attacks .
so what ?
we see it start . and we see it grow up to the stable state the wars around the world look like .
we all , i think , believe in compassion .
because , after all , god is just .
it entails understanding the pain of the other .
he said , &quot; god wants bread . that &apos;s it . god wants bread . i know what god wants . &quot;
the rabbi came in and saw what was going on .
but about 10 percent of the time , after the patient has recovered from one of those events , pain persists .
the lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on -- caused excruciating , burning pain .
we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet , and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics .
we know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left .
this was 50,000 years ago , so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope , or something like that out in the desert , but it probably would not have caused global devastation .
it &apos;s right here .
well , let me ask you , what happens if you &apos;re standing in the middle of the road and a car &apos;s headed for you ? what do you do ? you do this .
and you can hit it again . that &apos;s kind of ham-fisted . you might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever , so you don &apos;t do that .
so ...
because as we heard yesterday , countries can lose stars from their flags , but they can also lose press freedom , as i guess americans among us can tell us more about .
the small one was , i just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes , so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years .
it &apos;s business anywhere .
it &apos;s a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m .
we believe that in the last 10 years companies that we &apos;ve financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world .
but that is what happens if you &apos;re in business of independent media , and if you are a banker for independent media .
and we came up with this idea of issuing bonds , press freedom bonds .
thank you .
now , yeah , what do we mean by beautiful ? that &apos;s one thing .
that &apos;s wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical .
because they use mathematics we already have .
the more and more symmetry you have , the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory .
here &apos;s what newton himself said : &quot; nature is very consonant and conformable to her self . &quot;
life can emerge from physics and chemistry , plus a lot of accidents .
no schooling was possible for him , except a few weeks here , a few weeks there .
and his great friend speed went to his side and said , &quot; lincoln , you must rally or you will die . &quot;
in 1863 , when the emancipation proclamation was signed , he brought his old friend , joshua speed , back to the white house , and remembered that conversation of decades before , when he was so sad .
my relationship with him began on a rather curious level .
and there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth -- all the romantic trappings .
he once said that he laughed so he did not cry , that a good story , for him , was better than a drop of whiskey .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced i learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father .
he said , &quot; how often do you make these horrible wishes ? &quot;
it &apos;s about the size of a rugby ball .
and cyrus makes a declaration .
and that change , that great historic moment , was made possible by cyrus , the king of persia , reported for us in hebrew in scripture and in babylonian in clay .
and xenophon &apos;s book on cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the founding fathers of the american revolution .
it &apos;s a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event , two different religious takeovers of a political fact .
islamic revolution , no more cyrus ; we &apos;re not interested in that history , we &apos;re interested in islamic iran -- until iraq , the new superpower that we &apos;ve all decided should be in the region , attacks .
and for me , to take this object to iran , to be allowed to take this object to iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what iran is , what different irans there are and how the different histories of iran might shape the world today .
every time a young baby learns something new -- to focus its eyes , to mimic a movement or a facial expression , to pick something up , to form a word or to sit up -- new synaptic connections are being built in the brain .
if a child soils its nappy at 8 : 30 , he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again .
across europe , a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community-based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential . when i first started to work in romania nearly 20 years ago , there were 200,000 children living in institutions , and more entering every day .
and that fascinated me , because i &apos;d been messing around with a camera most of my life .
how do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day , the 21st of september ?
and we invited everybody , and no press showed up .
i &apos;m really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry , their art , their literature , their music , their sport , whatever it might be .
and obviously he never came down . the statement was never made .
and after lots and lots of meetings obviously , i &apos;m delighted that this man , ahmad fawzi , one of my heroes and mentors really , he managed to get unicef involved .
you can &apos;t just expect it to work . you have to get out and work . &quot;
obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
why don &apos;t we all team up ? why don &apos;t we bring truce to life ?
if you put one drop , one drop of something , in that water , it &apos;ll change it forever .
i was introduced to robyn , the swedish pop star , and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion .
we do more than that .
and the orthopedic center was closed .
well without thinking , i told him &quot; come tomorrow .
it &apos;s not a priority . &quot;
the stump or cast prosthesis was made , and he was starting the real physical rehabilitation .
no need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
only one week -- one week try and not a single day more .
and you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them .
well don &apos;t think that the changes in afghanistan are over ; not at all . we are going on .
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view .
and when they fail , a nation literally suffers .
several , for me .
and by the way , it &apos;s continued to .
but , for me , i asked the question , &quot; well , where are these leaders coming from ?
but i was moved almost to tears because i understood what was happening to this young man .
and it gives me a lot of hope .
this is just a tiny part of the sky the kepler stares at , where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars , all at once , every half hour , and very precisely .
i &apos;m showing here venus , earth and mars -- three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live .
i know you &apos;re there because i can hear you , but i can &apos;t see you because i normally wear glasses .
but the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead .
hunting and fishing ? what is it ?
now , it may bring a certain amount of comfort , but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so .
and the strange thing -- folks , you may have noticed this too .
hmm . you &apos;ve heard of it .
i don &apos;t know what we &apos;re doing , believing in all this nonsense over all these years .
that &apos;s really sad to hear , and it hasn &apos;t helped them one bit , hasn &apos;t solved any of their problems .
and when it does , it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities , can fix it , can source the parts and keep it saving lives .
the nurse was there .
now you &apos;ve heard me mention oxygen a few times at this point .
it has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts .
what if you &apos;re in surgery and the power goes out ? no lights , no oxygen -- and your anesthesia stops flowing . it happens constantly in hospitals throughout the world , turning routine procedures into tragedies . erica frenkel demos one solution : the universal anesthesia machine . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
king ibrahim njoya of the bamum kingdom of cameroon developed shü-mom at the age of 25 .
it is about food , but it &apos;s not about cooking , per se .
we didn &apos;t know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility .
what they didn &apos;t tell us is that some carbs are better than others , and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food .
and those moms bought and prepared food .
in new york , an orange was a common christmas present , because it came all the way from florida .
and this took care of the situation resoundingly .
think of the frozen chicken nugget .
how much livestock do you need to produce this ?
less meat , less junk , more plants .
imagine your last hamburger .
all right , so let &apos;s take four subjects that obviously go together : big data , tattoos , immortality and the greeks .
why the greeks ?
the interesting thing , the original thing , would be to threaten somebody with immortality .
now , the human cost of that is obvious , once you start to think about it -- the suffering , the loss -- it &apos;s also , economically , enormously wasteful .
now , the exact figures here , we should take with a big grain of salt , but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial .
i think that &apos;s a big , big problem .
mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial -- caffeine , alcohol , nicotine , immune system enhancement , vision enhancement , anesthetics -- we take that very much for granted , but just think about how great progress that is -- like , having an operation before anesthetics was not fun .
it &apos;s also interesting to think about what other things are -- so if these all enabled great values , why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be ?
and then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities .
and i &apos;m wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces .
but then i started dreaming of having six colors .
jh : so many forces there .
and then there are all these forms that we don &apos;t know what they are , but they &apos;re equally well-resolved and complex .
and to interface with it , with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do , giving them pigment and paint just like an artist , it &apos;s a good ally .
i decide that i &apos;m going to get my very own piece of bazooka bubble gum .
she was tied up and thrown into the ring for other dogs to attack so they &apos;d get more aggressive before the fight .
i love contemporary art , but i &apos;m often really frustrated with the contemporary art world and the contemporary art scene .
i figured out their bios , their passions in life and their art styles , and i started making their work .
and i love to dig a hole .
and within this project , he &apos;s doing a smaller project called &quot; artists in residence . &quot;
so hopefully what happens is you never use it , and it &apos;s an heirloom that you pass down .
they &apos;re butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage .
so this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we &apos;ve become .
and i have to say , vera kind of scares me .
it shows these women playing with these toys .
they have to obey four simple laws .
and you might say , &quot; can you really be that specific ?
well , there are other ways of making a flap .
it &apos;s free . it runs on all the major platforms -- even windows .
and what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand .
whether you look up or look down , how do you get it up in space ? you &apos;ve got to get it up there in a rocket .
so they need to figure out how , in a computer , to flatten an airbag .
this is a 100,000-volt tesla coil that i built in my bedroom , much to the dismay of my mother .
in my mother &apos;s day , she didn &apos;t go to college .
i first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago .
and basically what you &apos;ll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy .
if you read management books now , a leader is somebody who can foster creativity , who can get his -- get the employees -- see , i still say &quot; his &quot; -- who can get the employees to talk to each other , who can basically build teams and get them to be creative .
i mean they have much larger vocabulary .
she &apos;s the man now . &quot;
then we have our bud light guy who &apos;s the happy couch potato .
and husbands can drag their wives across , if their wives don &apos;t feel ready .
so , turns out finding a memory in the brain isn &apos;t all that easy .
could we use , let &apos;s say , pharmacological drugs to activate or inactivate brain cells ?
whenever a mouse is in fear , it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box , trying to not move any part of its body , and this posture is called freezing .
after a kind of long , awkward period of time , steve broke the silence .
we can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box .
thank you . xl : thank you .
so my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience , i tried to understand : where -- in everyday life , in our normal experience -- do we feel really happy ?
that &apos;s why you can &apos;t hear more than two people .
you see that these people define success as something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it .
so , arousal is the area where most people learn from , because that &apos;s where they &apos;re pushed beyond their comfort zone and to enter that -- going back to flow -- then they develop higher skills .
means &quot; where were you born and raised and educated ? &quot;
of course , if anybody asked me then , &quot; where is your home ? &quot;
they move to new york city .
and i thought , &quot; anything that works for a 15-year-old boy ought to work for me . &quot;
that &apos;s not the point .
music : dj shadow .
there was an enormous gap in the world when i grew up .
they will start flying .
can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ?
but it &apos;s a very important role .
but this graph is after taking into account all of these known risk factors .
and what was remarkable about it was in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body , we thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin , or nerve transmission .
well , i &apos;m an experimental dermatologist , so what we did was we thought we &apos;d have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight .
and what we &apos;ve shown is that doing a sham irradiation -- this is the thick line here -- this is shining uv on the arm so it warms up but keeping it covered so the rays don &apos;t hit the skin .
we think they &apos;re then stored in the skin , and we think the sunlight releases this where it has generally beneficial effects .
entrepreneurs are people -- because we have a lot of them in this room -- who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it .
but kids could be entrepreneurs as well .
i open up chapter eight talking about budgeting .
and i knew she wouldn &apos;t want me to go get them , so i just did it anyway .
and then i would go back to the other end of the beach and sell them to the rich kids .
i saw there was money in garbage .
so i love that recurring revenue model i started to learn at a young age .
so i just packaged them . i &apos;m like 12 , right ?
he said , &quot; i work too damn hard for my money . i &apos;m not going to see you ever waste a penny . &quot;
maybe four nights out of the week read them bedtime stories and three nights of the week have them tell stories .
don &apos;t medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really , really freaking bad .
but we have a major shortage of organs .
and this is actually real photography , timed photography , showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days .
this was an injured urethra on the left side .
here we take a scaffold , and we basically -- scaffold can be like a piece of paper here .
it takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ .
it &apos;s now being seeded with cartilage .
we then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply .
if you present with a diseased wind pipe we &apos;d like to take cells from your windpipe .
but actually method a is the correct approach .
i was invited to meet with leading educators from the newly free eastern europe and russia .
either we have lost touch with those values or , no better , believe they need not or cannot be taught .
on a more personal note , this betrayal of our principles , our decency , our hope , made it impossible for me to avoid the question , &quot; what will i say , years from now , when people ask , &apos; where were you ? &apos; &quot; as president of a leading liberal arts college , famous for its innovative history , there were no excuses .
mediation and improvisation also assume a special place in this new pantheon .
while these past weeks have been a time of national exhilaration in this country , it would be tragic if you thought this meant your job was done .
now , i know what you &apos;re thinking .
and not only food , right .
and so they &apos;re beautiful , but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this .
and for that to happen , you need ideas like fair use to be central and protected , to enable this kind of innovation , as this libertarian tells us , between these two creative cultures , a commercial and a sharing culture .
the creator doesn &apos;t have any rights .
imagining that i had this deep conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws in the dmca .
so here &apos;s the lessons of openness that i think we need to learn .
and eventually these bigshot executives whip out their blackberries and they say they have to make really important phone calls , and they head for the exits .
in fact , everything was better than fine .
and this was really disappointing to doug , because before this time he was proud of what he did .
it was cancer . it was the bad kind .
that they should achieve what bandura calls self-efficacy , that you can do what you set out to do , and that you can reach a place of creative confidence and touch the snake .
you &apos;ll see broad bacterial groups , and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe , it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group .
i am collaborating with charlie brown .
jessica green : we &apos;re covered in germs . let &apos;s design for that .
and he was reading it in their library in the far east .
and our pc version became quite mature .
and according to fortune magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
and this , this was special . mister pants , or splashy , to his friends , was very popular on the internet .
they sell mister splashy pants shirts and pins .
i am a native of burkina faso .
fundraising was not an easy task .
and the kids , they love it .
my most recent project in gando is a high school project .
there &apos;s a new quality in this work .
so these are my illusion glasses .
make a wish .
and unlike anything else we &apos;ve just seen , virtual or not.voice : signed card detected .
it will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
you know , 2,000 years ago , europe : breakdown -- the fragmentation of the holy roman empire .
india , the united states , indonesia , brazil -- all of them are multiracial .
the chinese view the state as an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family -- not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
it &apos;s kind of arrogant .
when did that last happen ?
but i want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
and &quot; beatjazzers &quot; become as common as d.j. &apos; s .
inside your heart a voice is calling .
and the warmth of her body and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks , and i started to cry .
i started when i was 15 years old .
so i went back there with a 28 mm lens .
the army will shoot you , and hamas will kidnap you . &quot;
we didn &apos;t push the limit ; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought .
we &apos;re hungry for culture .
and they would put a number : &quot; please call this number if you know what &apos;s going on in providencia . &quot;
you might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008 .
for each project we do a film .
they asked me , &quot; please , make our story travel with you . &quot;
so now my wish is : i wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project , and together we &apos;ll turn the world inside out .
and as i think about the mesh and i think about , well , what &apos;s driving it , how come it &apos;s happening now , i think there &apos;s a number of vectors that i want to give you as background .
first , they really understood that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir .
and so basically even if you think it &apos;s 10 percent , 90 percent of the time , something that costs us a lot of money -- personally , and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things -- 90 percent of the time it &apos;s sitting around .
the opposite , as we know , is also true , often more true .
there &apos;s a pop-up general store every three weeks , and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies .
and it grows on a very regular daily basis .
but there is an underbelly .
fantastic potential for regenerative medicine .
the collapse in biodiversity , climate change , pandemics , financial crises : these will be the currency that we will think about .
i had no clue what she was talking about , but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again until the ninth grade .
i said , &quot; can i quit school then ? &quot;
this is one i remember fondly .
i &apos;m going to show you a very quick clip to show you how i painted and a little bit about my city , bangalore .
and , in exchange for me working with them , they taught me how to be cool .
we &apos;ll try and con them into buying it , and then ... &quot;
my mother fell very ill .
it &apos;s a secret .
this one is called &quot; what the fuck was i thinking ? &quot;
can you tell everybody your name ?
e : ooh .
sw : there you go . and , of course , if all else fails , you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta .
e : happy birthday to you .
e : stinker .
you could jump off the end into the deep end .
swimming , first principles .
so let &apos;s look at some examples . this is terry .
i suffered through spanish for junior high , first year of high school , and the sum total of my knowledge was pretty much , &quot; donde esta el bano ? &quot;
they were the normal high school curriculum for japanese students -- the other 4,999 students in the school , who were japanese , besides the american .
i used to be much bigger , much more muscular .
i got a female instructor first , to teach me the female role , the follow , because i wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities that the follow needed to develop , so i wouldn &apos;t have a repeat of college .
i couldn &apos;t develop the attributes in my toes , the strength in my feet , to do that .
but i ask a lot of questions , and i would love your advice .
and perhaps most important of all , two years later when the exam results came through , the pupils who had been put on these field trials who were in the lowest performing groups had jumped right to the top -- in fact , pretty much at the top decile of performance in terms of gcse &apos;s , which is the british marking system .
geoff mulgan : a short intro to the studio school
and the philistine who is sent down , their mighty warrior , is a giant .
so david , in that story , is supposed to be the underdog , right ?
when david lines up -- and he &apos;s not 200 yards away from goliath , he &apos;s quite close to goliath -- when he lines up and fires that thing at goliath , he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes .
so david &apos;s coming down the mountain , and he &apos;s clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat .
because he can &apos;t make his way on his own .
and this is what i thought for a long period of time , and that &apos;s in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit , the microbes that do bad things .
and that comes back to the diabetes story i was telling you .
so people are really into cleanliness , right ?
or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little , and 100 people who did not take antibiotics .
it &apos;s written using wiki software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save , and it goes live on the internet immediately .
you could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we &apos;re doing at wikipedia .
and i said -- you know , i always say , please don &apos;t do that ; that &apos;s not a good thing .
so we do have edits by anonymous users , which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about wikipedia .
is the information verifiable ? is it a hoax ? is it true ? is it what ?
i always laugh at this , because i have no idea how they &apos;re elected , actually .
and so as long as people trust me in my role , then that &apos;s a valid place for me .
but freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education .
but love isn &apos;t always a happy experience .
how many people around the world are dancing with elation at this very minute ?
you know , when you &apos;ve been dumped , the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being , and then go on with your life -- but no , you just love them harder .
like hunger and thirst , it &apos;s almost impossible to stamp out . &quot;
as a matter of fact , in new york , i often catch myself looking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot .
i think we &apos;re going to end up , in the next few years , to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms that pull us to one person rather than another .
why bows ?
one : curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow .
did it strike you ?
and by about the age of 15 , they &apos;re fully spotted black and white .
don &apos;t tell anyone . it &apos;s a secret .
now , one way to crack the code is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean , but it &apos;s a difficult job , and we actually don &apos;t have a rosetta stone yet .
now this is video of a session .
and i wanted to share this video with you not to show you any big breakthroughs , because they haven &apos;t happened yet , but to show you the level of intention and focus that these dolphins have , and interest in the system .
einstein said that &quot; i never think about the future — it comes soon enough . &quot;
well first of all , it &apos;s already allowing us to shift towards preventive , condition-based maintenance , which means fixing machines just before they break , without wasting time servicing them on a fixed schedule .
just a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies could yield savings of over 60 billion dollars to the healthcare industry worldwide , and that is just a drop in the sea compared to what we need to do to make healthcare affordable on a sustainable basis .
the worker of the future will be more like iron man than the charlie chaplin of &quot; modern times . &quot;
so think about the future — it will be here soon enough .
so this is called &quot; tembererana . &quot;
ladies and gentlemen , an historic flight has begun .
so the idea was , okay , keep that feeling of freedom , but change the vector and increase the time .
because you &apos;re going fast and you &apos;re up 3,000 meters or so .
i thought , okay , i will go out .
so it &apos;s really a play between these two approaches .
perfect answer .
but they failed , almost completely , to make any .
but i &apos;ll have to backtrack a little first .
we don &apos;t see those nuclear reactions in stars .
our connection to reality is never just perception .
here is one . persephone wasn &apos;t released .
it &apos;s the basic regulating principle of the enlightenment .
so this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that &apos;s the ratio in the u.k .
and that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020 .
so , off i went into friday afternoon traffic , and i &apos;ll never forget what i saw when i got there .
in a series of shows that includes &quot; 100 percent vancouver , &quot; &quot; 100 percent berlin , &quot; rimini protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society .
lyn gardner in the guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world , a map of the city and a map of ourselves , but there is no one fixed festival model .
second doctor : and good , just take it nice and slow , jake .
it &apos;s a spirit bear , or a kermode bear .
and i want people to understand and get the concept that , if we lose ice , we stand to lose an entire ecosystem .
and what scientists didn &apos;t predict is that , as this ice melts , these big pockets of black water are forming and they &apos;re grabbing the sun &apos;s energy and accelerating the melting process .
i got very nervous -- no rope , no safety line , the whole world is moving around me -- and i thought , &quot; i &apos;m in trouble . &quot;
oh , and they also happen to eat happy feet .
and we sit down , and that &apos;s when goran said to me , &quot; this is a good seal , ya .
and after she did this four or five times , she swam by me with this dejected look on her face .
she &apos;s about to let me know she &apos;s too frustrated with me .
i was doing some shopping beforehand .
for me , i like to call him frank .
hi , how are you ? good to see you .
it was a big miscommunication .
oh , that &apos;s where it was . go ahead and put it away .
joe : yeah . i &apos;m saving it for later .
there was a media blackout in 2008 , when there was post-election violence in kenya .
very different reality . i used to live in chicago where there was abundant internet access .
mobile connectivity in africa is pervasive .
juliana rotich : meet brck , internet access built for africa
my simple idea is that what &apos;s happened is , the real 21st century around us isn &apos;t so obvious to us , so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize , but which no longer exists .
isn &apos;t it weird ? you know , if collaboration is so cool , is cross-functional working is so amazing , why did we build these huge hierarchies ? what &apos;s going on ?
okay , so he attaches it to a transparent pipe , and he turns the water on .
you with me ? this point over here , the point at which the lines cross over , the pace of change overtakes the pace of learning , and for me , that is what i was describing when i was telling you about midnight .
it was usually too hot , too stuffy or just too smelly , and my father would not let us use the air conditioner .
so in early prototypes i built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system , and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen when also heated , and currently have this installation at the materials &amp; amp ; applications gallery in silver lake , close by , and it &apos;s there until august , if you want to see it .
they go to see michelangelo &apos;s &quot; david , &quot; and when they finally come face to face with the statue , they both freeze dead in their tracks .
please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re libertarian .
nature provides a first draft , which experience then revises .
here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species .
but look at the other three lines .
aren &apos;t those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and puritanism ?
it shoots up and it keeps going up .
and they say , &quot; keep your laws off my body . &quot;
you have the markings of shiva on the right , shiva &apos;s the liberal god . and they work together .
so i think the point -- the point of my talk , and i think the point of ted -- is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better .
have they got something hidden under their clothing ? what &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
and they &apos;re thinking , well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area , if the crowd is being hostile .
this is from a australian institute of criminology report .
now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons -- and people when they &apos;re actually saying , &quot; well hey , there might be some problems &quot; -- there &apos;s a couple of particular problems that get focused on .
the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody , they were simply shot in the head .
and a colleague of mine sent me this one from london .
all of us are makers .
dd : i know ford has new electric vehicles coming out .
you &apos;re really a driver or a passenger -- to use a volkswagen phrase .
this is andrew archer .
and you can &apos;t see this very well on the screen , but arduino -- arduino is an open-source hardware platform .
think how much money and how many years it took nasa to get satellites into space .
this is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it &apos;s all about sex tips .
glamour is a magic spell .
what glamour is all about -- i took this from a blurb in the table of contents of new york magazine , which was telling us that glamour is back -- glamour is all about transcending the everyday .
and this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous .
of course , they covered that with make-up , because lara croft did all those same stunts -- but she doesn &apos;t get black and blue , because she has sprezzatura .
it invites us into the world but it doesn &apos;t give us a completely clear picture .
is it something important ?
and that &apos;s to take isaac mizrahi &apos;s advice and confront the manipulation of it all , and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy , but also enjoy how it happens .
for years , i actually only wore hats .
if i was tired , i drank more espressos .
i went to the democratic republic of congo .
and when it rains hard rain , i scream and i run in circles .
and as the warm gulf washed over my naked head , i realized that it held the best and the worst of us .
it was energy , love and joy .
and then finally , to show that some of the differences between people , in how we judge others , can be explained by differences in this brain system .
and now , here comes the other pirate .
his was on the grass .
but of course , as you &apos;re probably aware , even in adulthood , people differ from one another in how good they are at thinking of other minds , how often they do it and how accurately .
so what i &apos;m showing you , from left to right , is how much activity there was in this brain region , and from top to bottom , how much blame people said that grace deserved .
this system takes a long time to develop , slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence .
the whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new .
to borrow a phrase from carrie fisher , which is in my bio there ; i &apos;ll just toss it out again -- &quot; these days even instant gratification takes too long . &quot;
this is exactly what i &apos;m looking for to speed up bedtime even more . &quot;
we turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line -- a finish line , incidentally , that we never reach , but a finish line nonetheless .
i was making my way , let &apos;s say , slowly to oxford , and i went through a news agent , and i saw a magazine , a men &apos;s magazine , and it said on the front , &quot; how to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds . &quot;
but they lack spark ; they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside -- they don &apos;t know how to dream . and so what these ivy league schools , and oxford and cambridge and so on , are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit .
and good slow is , you know , taking the time to eat a meal with your family , with the tv switched off .
they need you to move at their rhythm .
and it seemed to me that this structure -- complex , rich and yet totally rational : it &apos;s an instrument -- had something to do with science , and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that .
in 1976 , i was asked to design a children &apos;s memorial museum in a holocaust museum in yad vashem in jerusalem , which you see here the campus .
the pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands -- they &apos;re not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there .
and there are chambers carved in the rock -- concrete walls , stone , the natural rock when possible -- with the light shafts .
nevertheless , beauty as the kind of fit ; something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that .
so the idea of a mistake : from the perspective of a jazz musician , it &apos;s easier to talk about someone else &apos;s mistake .
the only mistake is if i &apos;m not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
it &apos;s about being here in the moment , accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow .
my name is iman . i am a fashion model , an up-and-coming model from lahore .
they went through a lot to get here .
hot air rises , and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it .
it really does need fresh water .
and they were there for some time . and then they were gone .
those of you who grew up in india , do you remember in your childhood , dragonflies , swarms of dragonflies ? maybe at school , maybe tying little bits of string onto them ?
down in trivandrum , a bit later .
so , the dragonflies are actually coming from india on the northeast monsoon , but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air . incredible .
what &apos;s happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here .
this is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers .
no , they turn across here .
bee-eaters eat bees . this one has a nice blue cheek .
it was gone . they took my pro model off the shelf , which was essentially pronouncing you dead publicly .
just let the ledge do that , and it &apos;s easy , and the next thing you know , there &apos;s 20 more tricks based out of the variations .
it &apos;s fairly mellow , and it &apos;s beckoning to do bank tricks , right ?
i should say this . there &apos;s some sort of beautiful symmetry that the degree to which we connect to a community is in proportion to our individuality , which we are expressing by what we do .
i &apos;ve been all around the world , and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name , and it &apos;s such a weird , visceral experience .
thank you .
it &apos;s a complicated physics problem .
and what was god &apos;s will ?
well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get shot down .
they &apos;ve invented websites that will allow people to be free .
it is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision .
he thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of suffering in war .
it is a -- sort of a great human progress .
and so of course , radically unlike the real world , and like the internet , the whole thing is expanding very , very quickly , and historically exponentially .
it &apos;s also more memorable if i show you that picture , and i show you c-h-a-i-r on a piece of paper .
philip rosedale : i think that &apos;s great . that &apos;s such a deep question . yeah .
when you think about stuff that people have built that &apos;s popular -- jh : cbgb &apos;s has to close eventually , you know . that &apos;s the rule .
handlebar mustache . kind of a village people sort of a character .
but it &apos;s not a bunch of programmers .
i guess , and you &apos;re asking , what do i think about that ? how do i -- jh : what &apos;s your response to the people who would say , that &apos;s horrifying ?
a meditator .
and probably , the fact that we don &apos;t know that is why , so often , although we seek happiness , it seems we turn our back to it .
when you are at the bottom of the wave , you hit the bottom .
so now , if the inner conditions are stronger -- of course , the outer conditions do influence , and it &apos;s wonderful to live longer , healthier , to have access to information , education , to be able to travel , to have freedom . it &apos;s highly desirable .
so , because the basic fabric of consciousness is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone , there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting .
but that &apos;s the only way to go .
in very short , people who have more activity in the right side of the prefrontal cortex are more depressed , withdrawn . they don &apos;t describe a lot of positive affect .
that &apos;s what we try to do in different places .
now , the problem of human diversity , like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-questions .
because if we go far enough back , we share a common ancestry with every living thing on earth .
but looking around the world at the diversity of humans , he said , &quot; well , you know , we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories . &quot;
a haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes -- a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length .
that means that africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer .
lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types , oxygen isotopes and so on .
the tool styles don &apos;t change that much .
the changes that allowed us to do that , the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us , allowing us to create novel cultures , allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one i &apos;ve just been on .
in this case , you actually can .
an egg is a beautiful , sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things , such as chickens .
around us , there &apos;s nothing .
gravity is more powerful where there &apos;s more stuff .
well , first , you need energy , but not too much .
and scatters the templates through the ocean .
they accumulate information , they learn .
i hope you agree that this is a powerful story .
a lot of people buy the biggest house they can afford , and actually slightly bigger than that .
no one .
two thirds are not saving now .
it &apos;s only a problem now when the chocolate is next to us .
huge shortage of organs , god forbid , if you need one .
so this notion of loss aversion kicks in when it comes to savings too , because people , mentally and emotionally and intuitively frame savings as a loss because i have to cut my spending .
they take a little bit of the increase in the paycheck home and spend more -- take a little bit of the increase and put it in a 401 plan .
if you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year on lottery tickets , we need to think about that .
probably somewhere around 1,500 .
you &apos;re on with they might be giants .
so we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer , and they came to me and said , &quot; shekhar , what do you think ? &quot;
it &apos;s a symbolic gesture . i tear up the script , i go and i panic myself , i get scared .
&#91; unclear &#93; , you said that yesterday . i &apos;m just repeating it because that &apos;s what i follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere , the emptiness .
but all before that there was a woodcutter .
i have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way , but i have the potential .
they said , &quot; we won the armada . &quot;
you dare to keep secrets from me ?
the architecture is telling a story .
and now , out of the mythology of that , i &apos;m starting to create a world .
when you get up , the night and day is a contradiction .
i built this bar with my bare hands from the finest wood in the county .
you &apos;ve gone through hundreds of tv channels , just switching channel after channel , and then suddenly you actually stop on one .
a well told promise is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot and propels you forward through the story to the end .
and i learned a key insight to character .
so i researched everything i possibly could .
and a year after that , we did conquer it .
and that was the year that they restored and re-released &quot; lawrence of arabia . &quot;
ha ha . no , no , no .
i promise , i will never let anything happen to you , nemo .
and i got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps .
and the people who made money from brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests .
this is where we stand today .
and then we need to use less again .
we need groups to work together that never have .
if we work with those , if we change those companies and the way they do business , then the rest will happen automatically .
it &apos;s not all fun and games .
they &apos;re also undertaking a study to look at all of their supplies of palm oil to see if they could be certified and what they would need to change in order to become third-party certified under a credible certification program .
if you take a look just at water , what we see is that , with four very common products , you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products , and then you look at how much water input was put into them , and then you look at what the farmer was paid .
i still remember this decisive moment .
imagine that the locomotor system is a car .
let me summarize : the rat received a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord .
and there is a very important message hidden behind this discovery .
grégoire courtine : the paralyzed rat that walked
and my brother and i were raised with all that you really need : love , strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work , that there was nothing that we could not do .
we all know .
i never did it .
because the world is big .
summertime and the living is easy fish are jumping and the cotton is high oh , your daddy &apos;s rich and your ma is good-looking so hush little baby don &apos;t you cry and i opened my eyes , and i saw that she had her eyes closed .
&quot; the human voice : mysterious , spontaneous , primal . &quot; with these words , soprano claron mcfadden invites us to explore the mysteries of breathing and singing , as she performs the challenging &quot; aria , &quot; by john cage . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but they had an amazing freedom , which was they didn &apos;t have to make any money from it .
so the internet needs addressing and directions .
one of the most popular websites in the world , run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that youtube or google were particularly privileged to do about it .
and then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project .
it does make you wonder if there were , for instance , a massive , extremely popular star trek convention one weekend , who would be minding the store ?
you send in a picture of your cat if it looks like hitler .
released it on the streets of manhattan .
jonathan zittrain : the web as random acts of kindness
they say , you know , such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people , because we test students with problems they haven &apos;t seen before .
and that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people .
and basically , teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching .
in the year 2000 , korea did already very well , but the koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence .
the other part is the belief that all children are capable of success .
now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom .
you just can &apos;t rely on the people out there to help you with this .
and in the end , there &apos;s better bargaining between the authorities and citizens , and democracies , capitalism -- everything else flourished .
and it reminded me of a day in 1971 .
it turns out : 2,000 dollars .
and of course , even if that &apos;s true , then what about initial buying power ?
she typically buys a cow . the cow gives milk .
and of course , it &apos;s very beneficial in a lot of ways .
he has produced some power generators , which we are now doing an experiment in bangladesh , in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas , which is running these generators .
and i will now , here , onstage , try to predict when that will happen -- that asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world , as it used to be , over thousands of years .
on this axis , as i used to have income per person in comparable dollar .
in the 1930 &apos;s now , you can see that japan is going to a period of war , with lower life expectancy .
and they decided to go not only for health and education , but also starting to grow their economy .
washington , d.c. went out here .
the bubbles , not my bubbles , but the financial bubbles .
so , always avoid war , because that always pushes human beings backward .
so for now , let &apos;s turn to the evidence for dark matter .
can we see it more visually ? yes , we can .
now , it will only be a perfect ring if the source , the deflector and the eyeball , in this case , are all in a perfectly straight line .
ok , so , a quick review then , to see that you &apos;re following .
no one was predicting ahead of time this is what &apos;s going to be found .
so one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector .
he &apos;s also our brother .
and you &apos;ll see , just now , a nurse coming back to the tray , which is their sort of modular station , and dropping the syringe she &apos;s just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again .
you load it up in the normal way . this is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license .
so we think , first and foremost , aids is a policy issue .
and one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active .
so by itself , i think this tells a lot about how people behave .
we have no consistent testing .
i &apos;m going to talk a little bit in a minute about how we can use this kind of information to learn something that &apos;s going to help us think about the world .
so this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy .
trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision .
while we &apos;re doing bailouts , this is what happened .
and i could see why he thought , you know -- it was so beautifully done .
and he thought , &quot; what if we do this ? &quot;
and now kinetic and architectural firms like grimshaw are starting to look at this as a way of coating buildings so that they gather water from the fog .
they actually export water molecules through .
but then right after that , they emit a protein that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles so that they fall out of solution .
at biomimicry guild , which is my consulting company , we work with hok architects .
and we &apos;ll begin to be able to do as cody does , and actually be in touch with these incredible models , these elders that have been here far , far longer than we have .
i go , &quot; why ? &quot;
they belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents , and girls would be dolled up to get married .
if they &apos;re bad , they &apos;re your creation . learn from it .
what you see , if you see the title called &quot; pm &apos;s car held . &quot;
and they didn &apos;t say anything .
secondly , this concept .
friends , you will hear a lot about it .
this is a project that we call recaptcha , which is something that we started here at carnegie mellon , then we turned it into a startup company .
now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
and this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing captchas on the internet .
and some of them , like paleontological shvisle , they contain snoop dogg .
first of all , translating the web .
okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
so it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
so let me show you one example .
but the magical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language .
what does it do really well ? it creates economies of scale , significant and long-term resource investment , the expertise of many different kinds of people and different kinds of minds , and for individuals , consumers , it &apos;s bringing the standards , rules and recourse that we really want as consumers , and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise , and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation .
i see this incredible speed and scale .
you can earn 60 euros . isn &apos;t that great ? yes or no ? &quot;
and for me , when i think about our future , and all of those problems that seem incredibly large , the scale is impossible , the urgency is there , peers , inc. provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems .
yes , it &apos;s better to make more money rather than less , or to graduate from college instead of dropping out , but the differences in happiness tend to be small .
there are three questions . the first one is a happiness question : how do you feel , on a scale ranging from very bad to very good ? second , an activity question : what are you doing , on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching tv ?
well , how often do people &apos;s minds wander ?
now europe came as a shock to me , and i think i started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in .
so here i was , december 7th , 2008 .
we want peace . &quot;
and yes , we africans can .
he was really nervous , because his dad had been , you know , beheaded for being the king of england and he was nervous about the fact that conversations that got going in , like , bars and stuff would turn to -- this is kind of -- it &apos;s hard to believe , but people in the 17th century in england were starting to talk about , you know , philosophy and stuff in bars .
i mean , you want to call it godless , you know , you call it godless .
and seeing what happens , it was ok to generalize , and say , i &apos;m sure that this will happen anytime we make one of these things .
i mean , if you can think how important -- if you have a gps system and there are no satellites , it &apos;s not going to be much use . but , like -- but , you know , if somebody had a gps system in the 17th century some king would have gotten together an army and gone to get it , you know . if that person -- audience : for the teddy bear ? the teddy bear ?
i may not care about the fact that it &apos;s prohibited from heating this solution .
but at any rate , we finally did have a device that would reproduceably put a frog out of sight and get him back alive .
you know -- and there is a lot -- there is a lot -- a lot has been going on since isaac newton and all that stuff happened .
and so he came up with this theory , and he said , this will be cool , because it &apos;ll be a longer growing season in sweden , you know , and the surfers liked it , the surfers thought , that &apos;s a cool idea , because it &apos;s pretty cold in the ocean sometimes , and -- but a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad , you know .
there isn &apos;t a problem with global warming any longer , so we can -- you know , they &apos;re funding .
we &apos;ve spent the last couple of years pondering this , making a list of the different things that we had to do , and so we developed a new technology , it &apos;s software and hardware , that actually can generate thousands and thousands of genetically diverse stem cell lines to create a global array , essentially avatars of ourselves .
but it isn &apos;t really enough just to look at the cells from a few people or a small group of people , because we have to step back .
it has massively parallel processing capability , and it &apos;s going to change the way drugs are discovered , we hope , and i think eventually what &apos;s going to happen is that we &apos;re going to want to re-screen drugs , on arrays like this , that already exist , all of the drugs that currently exist , and in the future , you &apos;re going to be taking drugs and treatments that have been tested for side effects on all of the relevant cells , on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells .
then i started going into the tunnels , which made me realize that there &apos;s a whole new dimension to the city that i never saw before and most people don &apos;t get to see .
instead of looking at reproductions of it at home , you &apos;re actually feeling the hand-laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight .
this is the new york city farm colony , which was a poorhouse in staten island from the 1890s to the 1930s .
nearby there &apos;s a french bunker , and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met .
i feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually in order to preserve their memories in a creative way -- before they &apos;re lost forever .
but , actually , we don &apos;t do that .
by extension , we think to ourselves , &quot; why it &apos;s hotter in summer than in winter must be because we &apos;re closer to the sun . &quot;
and the reason it &apos;s like that is because it &apos;s dead boring to have a load of concentric circles , whereas that &apos;s much more exciting , to look at something at that angle , isn &apos;t it ? right ? and by doing it at that angle , if you &apos;ve got that misconception in your head , then that two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses .
and governments do very well . they pat themselves on the back .
i love things that are alive .
and as i pause for a few seconds , have a look at the screen .
and we also have to be aware of the issues .
the rna people would talk about the rna world .
so what we &apos;re trying to do is do reactions -- not in one flask , but in tens of flasks , and connect them together , as you can see with this flow system , all these pipes .
and we &apos;re now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell .
so this will reorganize the way we design things .
we &apos;re proposing to do it in just a few hours , once we &apos;ve set up the right chemistry .
so there &apos;s good news .
so this is a limitation .
it &apos;s two surveys , and you can see what &apos;s happening now .
but even this is not a fair representation of africa , because it &apos;s an average , it &apos;s an average speed of reduction in africa .
and then , you see , these were famine years .
millennium development goal rates for child mortality is fully possible .
welcome to a decent life .
it &apos;s very clear that this is what happens .
and if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start riding on scooters .
of course , as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible , and that &apos;s what was said by suzuki .
broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time .
and nano was , bang , 2,000 dollars .
you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
we &apos;ve talked about mobility and the rest of it , let &apos;s talk about health .
looks absolutely ridiculous .
you cannot say it &apos;s a mere treatment 10,000 dollars , but because you are poor i &apos;ll give it for 9,000 .
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;d like to end before time .
i said , &quot; whoa , science is so wonderful , i have to become a scientist . &quot;
my favorite and most successful app is bustin jieber , which is â   â   which is a justin bieber whac-a-mole .
when we design the app and we sell it , it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to , all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations .
so it &apos;s not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here .
they operate anywhere from , you know , maybe 200 to 300 degrees celsius .
the fuel , like i said , is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors , fukushima and three mile island -- looking back at three mile island , we didn &apos;t really see this for a while — but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , steam , in an oxidizing environment , they &apos;ll actually produce hydrogen , and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products .
so i &apos;m really excited .
but over the past 10 or 20 years , what &apos;s happened is that services are being commoditized as well .
why ? because the experience happens inside of us .
and now , with the experience economy , it &apos;s about rendering authenticity .
the opposite , of course , is -- fake fake .
knowing where your heritage is : what you have done in the past .
right ? it &apos;s beans ; right ? it &apos;s coffee beans .
so perfectly organized a structure , it was hard not to attribute divinity to it .
and like this magnificent origami , cells are developing at one million cells per second at four weeks , as it &apos;s just folding on itself .
i would make things for people as a way of , you know , giving , showing them my love .
the next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex .
and -- so the way i saw this in my mind at first , was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed , and the pieces would move far out , and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel , to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center .
from an engineering point of view , this is just a little four-bar linkage .
because when i was a kid , i also played a lot of guitar .
are we alone ? seti .
because they actually said that you can get any color you like in a spectrum .
for instance , you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the sun .
and later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything strange with these objects .
we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun-like stars .
you can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far , far , far from solar system .
it will take about five years .
and this is where my story starts .
so very quickly -- really about six weeks into this research -- i ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that i didn &apos;t understand or had never seen .
and to me , the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we &apos;re not worthy of connection , was something that , personally and professionally , i felt like i needed to understand better .
they &apos;re willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out .
and she said , &quot; what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
so this is what i learned .
one of the things that i think we need to think about is why and how we numb .
our job is to look and say , &quot; you know what ? you &apos;re imperfect , and you &apos;re wired for struggle , but you are worthy of love and belonging . &quot;
i had about 600 milligrams of caffeine , zero of alcohol .
the rest of it is the bedside console ; just for reference , this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago -- i mean , really until now .
but unfortunately , these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body parts .
usually it does , and when it does , it even lands automatically .
so i &apos;ve told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are , how you might operate one of these drones , and what a drone could do for you .
it weighs only about two kilograms , but it can carry half its weight .
we did not even -- i think adversity is not even the right word .
so , here &apos;s steven alone , sharing this story in the world .
anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something ? let &apos;s look at prayer .
detrol . in the side effects for his drug , integrated into that , the stem cell transplant that he had , the first in the world , shared openly for anyone who wants to see it .
so , we went from this story of steven and his history to data , and then back to paper , where we went back and engaged the medical care system .
you don &apos;t have the blinding , you don &apos;t have data , it doesn &apos;t follow the scientific method .
you can see here , the blue dots on the top , the light ones , those are the people in the study in pnas that you wanted to be on . and the red ones are the ones , the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn &apos;t want to be .
it was that little outliers there . you see that guy that lived a long time ?
i remember march the 15th , 2000 .
one of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material , carbon , that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor , and when the vaporized carbon condenses , it condenses back into a different form : chickenwire rolled up .
the power plant of tomorrow is no power plant .
i &apos;ve carried this photograph with me every day since then .
it gets worse .
so this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system .
are they interconnected ?
if you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company , you get control , but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares .
this means that its structure is probably the result of self-organization .
in parts of the world where there are no bees , or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees , people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand .
nobody &apos;s in charge .
we stopped planting cover crops .
it moves through the plant so that a crop pest , a leaf-eating insect , would take a bite of the plant and get a lethal dose and die .
plant them in a pot on your doorstep .
we &apos;re kind of at a tipping point .
so what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale ?
we even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale .
one of those is in extreme environments .
i was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and i played as safely and as quietly as possible .
the fact that there &apos;s one weird red dot that &apos;s up above the curve , there &apos;s one weirdo in the room -- i know who you are , i saw you earlier -- that &apos;s no problem .
i have a brother in-law named bobo -- which is a whole other story .
because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels , when in reality , if i know everything about your external world , i can only predict 10 percent of your long-term happiness .
you got good grades , now you have to get better grades , you got into a good school and after you get into a better school , you got a good job , now you have to get a better job , you hit your sales target , we &apos;re going to change your sales target .
and finally , random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness .
she &apos;d make this kind of , like , wall of tofu cooking , and it would confuse the customers , because they all thought it was a restaurant .
i found this book . it &apos;s called , &quot; thoughts on design , &quot; by a man named paul rand .
and this is in 1993 .
so , this happened in 1993 .
and so i never developed the ability to have a staff .
i noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive -- this is , like , a touch screen -- and i noticed how you can only touch five places , and so , &quot; why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere ? &quot;
so i took 16 ipod nanos and made a kind of a nano fish , basically .
i brought you guys together again .
their culture isn &apos;t working in schools , and i &apos;m going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem .
and in fact , university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to 70 percent female population in universities .
and little moments in my life .
the answer to that question changes depending on who &apos;s sitting around that table .
we need to put ourselves into boy culture .
they &apos;re nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies .
space-time underwent a phase transition .
is this a problem ? yes , it &apos;s a big a problem .
why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition ?
gian giudice : why our universe might exist on a knife-edge
and what i learned was , although at the time , like everyone else , i thought sheep were pretty stupid because they didn &apos;t do what we wanted them to do , what i realize now , probably only just in the last few weeks looking back , is the sheep weren &apos;t stupid at all .
it &apos;s just a collection of things that have been done before , but bringing them together in a different way .
i &apos;ll just describe how this works .
now , it &apos;s no secret , because i like collecting things , that i love the natural history museum and the collections of animals at the natural history museum in dioramas .
i put my friends in jars , i put this character , this sort of endangered species character in a blender .
after two years of an innovative design and construction process , the proof of concept made its public debut in 2008 .
you &apos;re not powering the propeller , you &apos;re powering the wheels .
here &apos;s why .
bob mankoff : that &apos;s my first wife .
&quot; i don &apos;t like to see animals suffer -- even in cartoons . &quot;
here &apos;s one of his cartoons .
and this is my most well-known cartoon .
oooh . hmm . too funny .
see , that &apos;s probably not going to be new yorker humor .
if we &apos;re in a purposeful mood , that makes us anxious .
these cartoons are not about them . they &apos;re about us .
&quot; lassie ! get help ! ! &quot;
thank you .
they seem fantastic to me . they cost very little to develop .
it was an absolute masterpiece .
another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value , which remember , is what , after all , the environmental movement needs to be about : this again is from prussia , from , i think , about 1812 , 1813 .
however , what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value , and it &apos;s much fairer .
now , if we have all these tools at our disposal , we simply have to ask the question , and thaler and sunstein have , of how we can use these more intelligently .
so i just want to get your first impressions when you see that , when you see the diamond shreddies box there .
because they help people share news .
i realized society didn &apos;t value my passion .
so , memetics : memetics is founded on the principle of universal darwinism .
and as dan dennett puts it , if you have those , then you must get evolution .
the information that is copied , he called the replicator .
it &apos;s that which is imitated , or information which is copied from person to person .
audience : sb : mmm mmm .
the point of memetics is to say , &quot; oh no , it doesn &apos;t . &quot;
we began , perhaps 5,000 years ago , with writing .
n , the same thing , the number of communicative civilizations out there &#91; that &#93; we might expect in our galaxy .
but not only is it painful , it kills lots of babies , it kills lots of mothers , and it &apos;s very expensive to produce .
one that is obviously happening all around us now , is that the temes turn us into teme machines , with these implants , with the drugs , with us merging with the technology .
my wife sent me a message , &quot; whoa , earthquake , &quot; and then disappeared for 25 minutes .
andre told me , after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way , that there is no new research here .
and the fellow in the vest there , craig toten , he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this .
and the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals .
they use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton .
so the image behind me shows a piece of tissue in one of these cross helical skeletons cut so that you &apos;re looking at the surface of the wall .
those fibers in that particular orientation give the skeleton a very , very different behavior .
do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your band-aid off slowly -- you take a long time , but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach ?
here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience , and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time .
and how much punishment would i get if i get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the more religious people -- the people who remembered more of the commandments -- cheated less , and the less religious people -- the people who couldn &apos;t remember almost any commandments -- cheated more .
our subjects doubled their cheating .
all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were carnegie mellon students .
the question is , are we going to test those intuitions ?
so a more challenging question is one that i was asked , actually , by one of our writers a couple of weeks ago , and i didn &apos;t know the answer : what &apos;s the world &apos;s best performing currency ?
there &apos;s a p.r. company called edelman , they do this very interesting survey every year precisely around trust and what people are thinking .
so suddenly , you start thinking , well amazon potentially could push this .
what you can do is , the more you run , the more points you get , and we have an auction where you can buy nike stuff but only by proving that you &apos;ve actually used the product to do stuff . &quot;
thank you .
we grew up playing — mom &apos;s from cape breton , coincidentally .
we just started yesterday .
there &apos;s 11 siblings . we , um — what will i tell them ?
instead , he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores .
now , we had to start somewhere , and so noam and i decided to base our cathedral , so to speak , on the simplest possible building block , which is something called nand .
the minecraft community went bananas over this project , and ben became an instant media celebrity .
so if area is what interests us , then one thing which is natural to do is to tile the area of this particular shape and simply count how many tiles it takes to cover it completely .
shimon schocken : the self-organizing computer course
rape is used as a weapon of war , instilling fear and depopulating whole areas .
all the technology is in place for us to communicate , and all the technology is in place to communicate this .
their availability for work can be such that it &apos;s , &quot; a few hours today .
they &apos;re from multiple agencies .
it manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways .
it simply passed the national lottery act and this is what followed .
this is now in the hands of the consortium .
do not underestimate the transformative power of truly modern markets .
it was just frightening .
solar can do it , and we certainly have to develop solar .
and there is one reaction that &apos;s probably the easiest fusion reaction to do .
if you just plot how much fuel we &apos;ve got left , in units of present world consumption .
it boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees .
we &apos;re going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country .
in fact , it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth .
if , however , the core issues that propelled the revolution aren &apos;t addressed , the consequences could be catastrophic -- not just for egypt , but for the entire region .
the egyptian people , and many other arabs who &apos;ve revolted and are in transition , have very high expectations of the government .
what this means is that human development , not secularization , is what &apos;s key to women &apos;s empowerment in the transforming middle east .
in 1895 , lord kelvin declared that heavier-than-air flying machines were impossible .
we are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it .
and so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans can &apos;t go , we &apos;d need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so .
so much for velcro , right ?
now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments .
scientists and engineers can indeed change the world .
rd : &quot; there is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you . &quot;
rd : yeah ?
i think you couldn &apos;t be human if you didn &apos;t ask those questions .
and then the financial collapse happened .
unfortunately , i cannot show their faces , neither can i disclose their true names , and that &apos;s because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates , offenders spending time in a correction facility about 20 minutes &apos; ride from here -- well , like everything in israel .
his backpack goes ballistic in some other direction .
because you have to understand that on these rides we are constantly hungry -- and after the rides also .
you have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen .
and he says -- because i also have volunteers riding with me , adults , who are sitting there listening to him -- and he says , &quot; and this was just the beginning of our ordeal until we ended up in israel .
well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly .
because the self likes to fit , to see itself replicated , to belong .
i applied to read anthropology at university .
but it &apos;s not . it &apos;s a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death .
in fact , i respect my self and its function .
and there on the smaller scale , the scale of an earring or a ceramic pot or a musical instrument , was a materiality and a soulfulness .
the brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy .
and instead , we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us .
there &apos;s 250 pavilions .
we didn &apos;t want to make a separate building and have separate content .
the british government -- any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
thank you .
one of them , from anthropology , is the study of human universals .
but if something is written on the slate , then some people could have more of it than others , and according to this line of thinking , that would justify discrimination and inequality .
well , pretty soon they were barraged with enraged letters , death threats , ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals , coming from irate left-handers and their advocates , and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the venom and vituperation that they had inadvertently inspired .
the only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres .
what a puzzle -- i wonder why .
ok -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding .
they use a band -- basically a rubber band , like this , only a little smaller .
a second later , with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger , he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp .
he says , &quot; ok . &quot;
i do .
that &apos;s peripety or peripeteia .
and , after that shoot , dirty jobs really didn &apos;t change , in terms of what the show is , but it changed for me , personally .
he stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way .
it can &apos;t be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site .
i mean , so many of the commercials that come out there -- in the way of a message , what &apos;s really being said ?
barack wants to create two and a half million jobs .
and i &apos;ve got malingering .
so i got the train to broadmoor .
and i &apos;d just seen a film called &apos; crash &apos; in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls .
so i tend to stay in my room a lot because i find them quite frightening .
so there &apos;s 1,500 people in his room .
he was taking me through the garden .
he said , &quot; that &apos;s leadership . &quot;
he said , &quot; why haven &apos;t you been returning my calls ? &quot;
and you know what , i think it &apos;s right that tony is out .
now , the reason i begin by saying &quot; no 9 / 11 , no war &quot; is that we have to acknowledge that islam , as interpreted by a very , very small , extremely radical group of people , was a precipitating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- the precipitating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- and as a consequence , at one degree of remove , the precipitating cause of the coming war that we &apos;re about to be engaged in .
well , so says george w. bush .
now , during the cold war , that may have been a defensible position for the united states to take .
what does it mean to say that there &apos;s an islamic democracy ?
noah feldman makes a searing case that both politics and religion -- whatever their differences -- are similar technologies , designed to efficiently connect and manage any group of people .
and the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal .
the oil slick was now moving north towards dassen island , and the rescuers despaired , because they knew if the oil hit , it would not be possible to rescue any more oiled birds .
but part way through , they ran out .
my mission as the penguin lady is to raise awareness and funding to protect penguins , but why should any of you care about penguins ?
we tried to answer this simple question : can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living , see spaces around them differently , think about the resources they use differently , interact differently ?
we took the corner of the car park in the station that you saw , and we made vegetable beds for everybody to share and pick from themselves .
we fundraised , we got some blackboards , we put &quot; incredible edible &quot; on the top , we gave it every market trader that was selling locally , and they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week .
first , they &apos;re going to create an asset register of spare land that they &apos;ve got , put it in a food bank so that communities can use that wherever they live , and they &apos;re going to underpin that with a license .
i said that to bill moyers , and he said , &quot; oh , we take anybody . &quot;
now , pride of place in this practice is given to compassion .
so the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point , i think -- that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group : your own nation , your own co-religionists , your own fellow countrymen . you must have what one of the chinese sages called &quot; jian ai &quot; : concern for everybody . love your enemies . honor the stranger .
and these -- whatever our wretched beliefs -- is a religious matter , it &apos;s a spiritual matter .
i &apos;d like to see it -- to give guidelines as to how to interpret the scriptures , these texts that are being abused . remember what the rabbis and what augustine said about how scripture should be governed by the principle of charity .
when i first saw living cells in a microscope , i was absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like .
so that &apos;s thousands of little grains of pollen there , and there &apos;s the pistil there , and these are the little things called trichomes . and that &apos;s what makes the flower give a fragrance , and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances .
there are places in africa where they do the mining of jewels , and you go to the sand where the rivers have the sand go down to the ocean , and it &apos;s like literally looking at tiny jewels through the microscope .
this grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion years old , and it &apos;s never eroded away like the way we have sand on earth erodes away because of water and tumbling , air , and so forth . all you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the sun , has these solar storms , and that &apos;s erosion by solar radiation .
so , using large-scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don &apos;t see x-rays of big things that often .
nature is my greatest inspiration .
still has the tag in it from me buying it , so i can take it back to the shop if she didn &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s not accurately colored to how it is in real life .
the problem with using living people is that to take an x-ray , if i x-ray you , you get exposed to radiation .
this is a commercial application of my most recent work .
so what i &apos;m going to do is , every now and again , i will make this gesture , and in a moment of powerpoint democracy , you can imagine what you &apos;d like to see .
you &apos;ll been engulfed by a red giant . &quot;
and i can with all honesty look her in the eye and say , &quot; because our pheromones matched our olfactory receptors . &quot;
even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse for bad housework , for instance .
but for me , it doesn &apos;t . that is a wonderful thing .
i know what is wrong . i have done wrong .
socrates , a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing .
and that &apos;s actually a shop in calcutta , but it &apos;s a place where we like our books .
if you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large , you had to live with a smaller gut .
are we going to start looking at what happens when your information source is turned off , as a famine ?
there &apos;s teodorín obiang .
but it wasn &apos;t about blood diamonds .
so we sent an undercover investigator in to secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite , and the resulting footage , well , it made some people very angry , and you can see that on youtube , but it proved what we had long suspected , because it showed how the state &apos;s chief minister , despite his later denials , used his control over land and forest licenses to enrich himself and his family .
there &apos;s corruption everywhere , so why focus on that sector ?
but literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency , and now it &apos;s fast becoming the norm and the law .
you can &apos;t travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle .
ideas get shorter . they become sound bytes .
tomorrow , i am going to cairo , and i &apos;m so moved that i will be with women in cairo who are v-day women , who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the middle east .
she had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman &apos;s body in it , a half a torso , and she would teach people , everywhere she went , what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like .
we come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time , moving towards a new place .
it &apos;s the sensible shoe of public address .
but you don &apos;t do this . &quot;
i miss michael .
now to me , this was always going to be a typographic solution , what i would call the opposite of type 101 .
huhh ! they &apos;ve been discovered by the sultan .
and the object itself invited exploration interaction , consideration and touch .
then again , who &apos;s to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren &apos;t exactly what the world needs ?
now , adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every &quot; don &apos;t do that , don &apos;t do this &quot; in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use .
no matter your position or place in life , it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away .
well , i was wrong . what i learned from these encounters was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life .
well , i &apos;ve returned to lincoln meadow 15 times in the last 25 years , and i can tell you that the biophony , the density and diversity of that biophony , has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation .
it was also formed in part by a beaver dam at one end that held that whole ecosystem together in a very delicate balance .
so i actually went to school in belfast , which was where all the action happened .
to play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing &quot; battlestar galactica . &quot;
by 2008 , we &apos;re going to kick the butt of the music industry .
and what &apos;s interesting about it is the market was actually created by the gamers themselves .
this is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today .
i &apos;m a video game addict , and it &apos;s not because of a certain number of hours i have spent playing , or nights i have gone without sleep to finish the next level .
a well-designed video game will seamlessly weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience .
i &apos;m not sure what the implications of my experience are , but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me .
as far as colleges go , there &apos;s about 350 colleges around the world teaching video game courses .
game designer david perry says tomorrow &apos;s videogames will be more than mere fun to the next generation of gamers . they &apos;ll be lush , complex , emotional experiences -- more involving and meaningful to some than real life . with an excerpt from michael highland &apos;s film &quot; as real as your life . &quot;
the way i think of it is , we can &apos;t learn to see until we admit we &apos;re blind .
so a more direct one , one that gives you more of the feeling of math , is something closer to pythagoras &apos; own proof , which goes like this : so here we have this triangle , and if we surround that c square with three more triangles and we copy that , notice that we can move those triangles down like this .
well , that &apos;s pretty amazing .
and what if i do this progression that the six-year-olds did of saying , &quot; ok , i &apos;m going to increase the speed by two each time , and then i &apos;m going to increase the distance by the speed each time ?
and how shall we look and verify that we actually have it ?
and you know , i saw all the visions of the first couple of sessions .
you just have to look at the human genome project .
the larger context of this is that are two unprecedented revolutions that are going on today .
it &apos;s really wonderful when we hear , &quot; oh , 99.9 percent of the letters in the code are the same .
there are three obvious ways of doing this .
humanity is going to go down this path .
and to focus too much on all the high-technology possibilities that exist .
that &apos;s the way these things work .
and then they become tadpoles and frogs . &quot;
i know . &quot;
and i said , &quot; oh , no , no .
despite her best efforts , comedian julia sweeney is forced to tell a little white lie when her 8-year-old begins learning about frog reproduction -- and starts to ask some very smart questions .
you could see in the middle that device , that little structure , squeezing out .
we don &apos;t need any of that ; we work on a beating heart .
our disciplinary conventions were funny as well .
funding barriers : another big area to be concerned with .
egos , of course , again , a huge problem if you &apos;re working in a multidisciplinary team , you &apos;ve got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt .
we may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes .
these two environments are totally different , but not only that , they &apos;re both utterly hostile .
these are places where mosquitos breed .
like , why would you write about something so boring , so ordinary ? you know ?
they understood the cultural challenge .
and they have to do that even if the net blocks the breeze , even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night and relieve themselves , even if they might have to move all their furnishings to put this thing up , even if , you know , they might live in a round hut in which it &apos;s difficult to string up a square net .
i would argue today , when we are distributing tools that we &apos;ve designed and that don &apos;t necessarily make sense in people &apos;s lives , we run the risk of making the same mistake again .
yeah well , you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round , a nice round shape .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
they wanted to stir up controversy .
those were poor guys fighting for their rights .
and i &apos;m very proud of what they did .
so really , it &apos;s not about the freedom of cartoonists ; it &apos;s about your freedoms .
what we call an earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time .
in the cambrian explosion , life emerged from the swamps , complexity arose , and from what we can tell , we &apos;re halfway through .
a 10-kilometer body hit the planet .
this is a gorgonopsian , or a gorgon .
there &apos;s no dinosaurs yet ; just this slow , saurian , scaly , nasty , swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes .
this led lee kump , and others from penn state and my group , to propose what i call the kump hypothesis : many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen , by high co2 . and the worst effect of global warming , it turns out : hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans .
this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps .
here &apos;s how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care .
asteroid strikes get all the coverage , but &quot; medea hypothesis &quot; author peter ward argues that most of earth &apos;s mass extinctions were caused by lowly bacteria . the culprit , a poison called hydrogen sulfide , may have an interesting application in medicine .
either way , they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma .
how did the chinese state agency for food and drugs allow this to happen ? &quot;
in the 1990s , there were a whole series of scandals concerning the production of brand name goods in the u.s. -- child labor , forced labor , serious health and safety abuses .
but they are extremely efficient organizations .
can i buy that product without compromising my ethics ?
the example , the role model , is there .
so the first time she realizes that wonder woman isn &apos;t coming , i &apos;ll make sure she knows she doesn &apos;t have to wear the cape all by herself because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers , your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal .
your voice is small , but don &apos;t ever stop singing .
when i was a freshman in high school , i was a live wire of nervous hormones .
there were things that were specific to me , and the more that i focused on those things , the weirder my poetry got , but the more that it felt like mine .
charlotte was very good at writing lists , but she refused to write any poems .
it &apos;s not uncommon for people to feel like they &apos;re alone or that nobody understands them , but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions , you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers , or your community , who will listen .
so i &apos;d like to close with this poem .
when i meet you , in that moment , i &apos;m no longer a part of your future .
their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience , change became not only possible , but inevitable .
during the early &apos; 80s , i spent a lot of time in central america , which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the cold war .
children in soweto playing on a trampoline .
nato forces went in , and the serbian army withdrew .
i met a band of homeless children who &apos;d come to jakarta from the countryside , and ended up living in a train station .
i didn &apos;t see either of the planes hit , and when i glanced out my window , i saw the first tower burning , and i thought it might have been an accident .
i tried to imagine myself in their place , and i was totally humbled by their courage and determination in the face of such catastrophic loss .
they trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly .
and you shred the candidate list .
so i will talk of what i remember as the most wonderful .
it &apos;s eastern religion in india and china and neighboring asian countries .
and all of the muslim majority countries across the income are coming down , as do the christian majority countries in the middle income range .
they have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman .
i went to the statistical authority of qatar , to their webpage -- it &apos;s a very good webpage . i recommend it -- and i looked up -- oh yeah , you can have lots of fun here -- and provided free of charge , i found qatar &apos;s social trends .
and there are two billion children in the world .
but it &apos;s inevitable that we will be two to three billion more .
and then , like everyone else in our generation , we went to live in a himalayan monastery .
and al gore said earlier that the most photographed image in the world , the most printed image in the world , was that of the earth . but this was in 1974 , and as of that moment this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed because we printed two billion copies of this photograph , and we took them hand to hand , door to door , to show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house because that was our surveillance system . we didn &apos;t have google ; we didn &apos;t have web crawlers ; we didn &apos;t have computers .
it wouldn &apos;t do just to vaccinate everyone .
let &apos;s get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about .
would you get in an airplane with 250 people you didn &apos;t know , coughing and sneezing , when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you , for which you had no antivirals or vaccine ?
it &apos;s the global public health information network .
let &apos;s increase the languages they crawl from seven to 70 , or more .
now their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent because other nations have started to report .
you can see my grandmother there .
it wasn &apos;t a great start .
and there &apos;s opportunities in a circular economy .
so be decisive on these issues .
so what can a business do today to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights ?
on having really good sustainability strategies , there are companies like nike , patagonia , timberland , marks &amp; amp ; spencer .
take a breath right now of this clear air in this room .
who wrote that ?
and we used these questions : share some of your life experiences with me .
it &apos;s two people , two warriors , dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other .
i invite you into three recent stories of mine , which are about this way of looking , if you will , which i believe exemplify the tenets of what i like to call compassion in storytelling .
this image , to me , is almost like from a shakespearean play , with a man , surrounded by various influences , desperate to hold on to something true within himself , in a context of great suffering that he has created himself .
in 2007 and 2009 i did stories on the delhi fire service , the dfs , which , during the summer , is probably the world &apos;s most active fire department .
and i &apos;ve had very serious doubt about its efficacy , and my own faith in humanity .
i think that &apos;s the cia asking what the code is for a ted membership .
this is -- this is intense material , i should warn you .
j i don &apos;t know . i guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
i mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
that &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
when you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be big brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching big brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
a basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements .
you place it in an art museum , it becomes a sculpture .
they weren &apos;t sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken , but they were sued because of california &apos;s proposition 65 , which stated that if there &apos;s anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning .
based on these findings , i have a question for you .
so ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don &apos;t know about , or at least don &apos;t pay that much attention to .
so that was my work , and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research , with figuring out exactly what this protein does , but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness -- so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren .
they &apos;re everywhere .
because these environmental solutions that julie can make in her home , her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her .
the doors open , the kids descend on this table of legs , and they are poking and prodding , and they &apos;re wiggling toes , and they &apos;re trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that .
curious encounters were happening to me at the time ; i &apos;d been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world .
heavy !
it can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space .
well , being different is not that difficult .
but then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
the most popular blogger -- it &apos;s not me -- it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9.5 million followers , or fans .
they work for longer hours with less income , less social welfare .
we heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
so what we did , we went to alaska , which is where the grizzlies rely on really high , almost inaccessible , mountain slopes for their denning .
in 2005 , a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of ecuador .
it &apos;s called the altiplano , or &quot; high plains &quot; -- a place of extremes and extreme contrasts .
sousa &apos;s fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these , quote , &quot; infernal machines . &quot; they would take it away .
and in 1939 , a lawyer , sydney kaye , started something called broadcast music inc . we know it as bmi .
my first love ...
common sense here , though , has not yet revolted in response to this response that the law has offered to these forms of creativity .
we watched tv ; they make tv .
it &apos;s the single greatest mapping project we &apos;ve ever been on .
and the amoeba dubia doesn &apos;t look like much , except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters , which is what makes you you , as far as gene code inside each of your cells , and this little amoeba which , you know , sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions , turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside .
your fear should be that you are not , that you &apos;re paying attention to stuff which is temporal .
we will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years .
but because each of your cells contains your entire gene code , each cell can be reprogrammed , if we don &apos;t stop stem cell research and if we don &apos;t stop genomic research , to express different body functions .
that brings up questions of privacy and insurability and all kinds of stuff , but it also allows us to start going after diseases , because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this , it turns out that three diseases with completely similar clinical syndromes are completely different diseases .
that is the genomically literate world . and that is a problem .
tiny landlocked state . no oil . no diamonds . no natural resources .
people are taking control of their own states , sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse .

now not all lies are harmful .
we wish we were better husbands , better wives , smarter , more powerful , taller , richer -- the list goes on .
it &apos;s as old as breathing .
the rest of us , we &apos;re only 54 percent accurate .
we all chatter with our fingertips .
they &apos;re going to be willing to brainstorm , name suspects , provide details .
pm : okay , those head shakes are much easier to spot once you know to look for them .
we make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long .
and i don &apos;t understand it , and i never will .
i was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago , and a nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make sense if you &apos;ve ever watched a james bond movie -- and a nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes , &quot; aha , we meet again , mr. bond ! &quot;
what we know about how to be who we are comes from stories .
language is not -- i mean , things don &apos;t have any mutable value by themselves ; we ascribe them a value .
my father was educated in cork , in the university of cork , in the &apos; 50s .
i was completely terrified , completely broken , and kept trying to find a new language , a new way to make sense of all of this .
this is a redemption we can all aspire to .
and the truth be told , this is it , isn &apos;t it ?
trouble in the valley , and trouble by the river too .
and let &apos;s see , you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar , and then you eat , and you eat , and you eat , and you -- she &apos;s about 300 pounds now .
you know , how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur ?
and i started working on this project -- oh , i have to tell you about this real quick .
but anyway , a friend of mine and i , dave hampton , decided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism .
so my wife says , &quot; well , you may like it , but nobody else will . &quot;
we snuck in on the weekend .
there &apos;s a kind of truncated camarasaurus skeleton , but the geometry &apos;s correct .
john , do you want to bring him up ?
we &apos;ve just opened the door , and it &apos;s for all of you to step through it .
coke is everywhere .
let &apos;s contrast that for a minute to development .
and in 2003 , the government of ethiopia started this new system in their own country .
now , that played itself out in the world cup campaign .
you start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn &apos;t be done in the village , and they agree to that .
let me tell you the story of shriram , an 18 month boy in bihar , a northern state in india .
and we are so close .
we did 250 hours of diving here in 2005 .
the top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like kingman reef , which is now protected .
well , there are several ways .
these are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of chile , and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom .
so we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take rocket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fishery is going to collapse very quickly .
and a few of us , a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working on this .
es : well , imagine that you have two gears of a watch , a big one and a small one .
so thank you for those numbers .
most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea , at the bottom of the sea .
bill lange : we tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average , and that we &apos;re real familiar with the animals that are in the first 200 or 300 feet , but we &apos;re not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom .
we make maps of these mountain ranges with sound , with sonar , and this is one of those mountain ranges .
dg : i think that &apos;s one of the greatest stories right now that we &apos;re seeing from the bottom of the sea , is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria .
you watch . it doesn &apos;t take long before two guys here -- this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight .
so here , you &apos;ve got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes , inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground .
although the vent sites are short-lived -- an individual site may last only 10 years or so -- as an ecosystem they &apos;ve been stable for millions -- well , billions -- of years .
it &apos;s absurd . it &apos;s just absurd .
so first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
and the textbook , i think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
and at that point , i &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing .
that &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve baited the hook , right ?
and the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; good morning america &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
finland is the best place in the world to see school systems .
and luckily , he met this guy , who is rodrigo baggio , the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in brazil .
or you could go to places like this .
many of them don &apos;t have electricity at home .
imagine an education system that started from questions , not from knowledge to be imparted , or started from a game , not from a lesson , or started from the premise that you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them .
so the trendiest schools in the world , high tech high and others , they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity .
the mcdonald &apos;s model scales .
most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools .
charles leadbeater : education innovation in the slums
so , i took a look at my life , a hard look at my life , and i saw some things very disturbing .
so i wear this whenever i have to do something that makes me a little nervous , like , i don &apos;t know , a tedx talk .
what do they want ? &quot;
all of that flies in the face of what they did .
so when you hear the words &quot; gay lifestyle &quot; and &quot; gay agenda &quot; in the future , i encourage you to do two things : one , remember the u.s. constitution , and then two , if you wouldn &apos;t mind looking to your left , please .
and guess what ?
as you may know , the entire world operates on a universal law : entropy , the second law of thermodynamics .
for me , it began as i was approaching my third act , my 60th birthday .
you see , if you have , over time , reacted negatively to past events and people , neural pathways are laid down by chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain .
they take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources .
there are markings on many plants that look like other insects .
and these electron microscope pictures -- here &apos;s one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye , have very , very different textures to what an insect might perceive .
and blowflies just can &apos;t help themselves .
now most pollinators that we think about are insects , but actually in the tropics , many birds and butterflies pollinate .
and i love the idea of something hidden .
or , you know , if anybody here is from boston -- so when the boston red sox won the world series after , i believe , 351 years , when they won the world series , it was amazing .
it baffles the mind . and so zig , being indian , likewise it baffles his mind . his favorite photograph -- my favorite photograph of his , which i don &apos;t have in here is indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of indians .
nobody wants to go on the middle passage . &quot;
and i also made a game about the trail of tears .
this is a project called flight patterns .
and you can see , over time , the ways the airports change .
and it &apos;s based on the premise that there are certain things that are easy for people , but really difficult for computers .
the amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to 46 minutes .
so we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces , and we fed those into the mechanical turk .
you &apos;d be fed a simple audio clip .
but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for .
you &apos;re hearing a person &apos;s life .
so this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address , but i &apos;m going to give you a little preview of what you can expect .
so of course , it took time , and i was nearly 40 , and i decided it &apos;s time to start as an artist .
so this spider goes through the whole alphabet with identical adjectives and substantives .
here it &apos;s &quot; candycity . &quot;
larger images , i started to run marathons .
that &apos;s another artist book project .
another glass project is in a public library in san jose , california .
so each building has its own personality .
you may think i &apos;m wrong in this , but i think that we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises , by moments when what we thought we knew , about our lives , about our careers , comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality .
and that &apos;s a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods .
and she &apos;s got a very large house .
a meritocratic society is one in which if you &apos;ve got talent and energy and skill , you will get to the top . nothing should hold you back .
in modern english that would mean it &apos;s a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to dependent on their business card .
i went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of western art .
and that &apos;s why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans , and contemplating the earth from outside its perimeters , etc .
we are highly open to suggestion .
and your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle .
it &apos;s probably , at my speed , at my age -- for anybody &apos;s speed at anybody &apos;s age -- going to take 60 , maybe 70 , hours of continuous swimming , never getting out on the boat .
and there are sharks .
i couldn &apos;t wait to prove the athlete i am , that nobody else in the world can do this swim .
and the next thing is paralysis .
and i got back in .
you need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this . &quot;
thank you .
this is the first one . this is an electrocardiogram .
now , this is an example of another obsolete technology , soon to be buried : the holter monitor .
why now ? why has this all of a sudden become a reality , an exciting direction in the future of medicine ?
furthermore it says , &quot; start time . &quot;
and really interesting stuff .
and this article from the economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world : &quot; mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people , more quickly , than any previous technology . &quot;
and finally , another example : sudden cardiac death .
so if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth , let &apos;s start with that . and since i got that idea , i &apos;ve had to shake hundreds of hands .
they &apos;re both wonderful and largely the same , except that computers happened in between .
and whatever you do , don &apos;t read anything about genetics that &apos;s published within your lifetime , or something .
this is a problem of such and such a type , and therefore there &apos;s a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that problem .
none of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those books .
and one of our canning cutaways .
so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world .
we &apos;ve got lots of little tidbits in the book .
we make every aspect of this burger .
surgeons are the tailors , the plumbers , the carpenters -- some would say the butchers -- of the medical world : cutting , reshaping , reforming , bypassing , fixing .
this persisted all the way into and through the renaissance .
the mayo brothers came out to visit lister in europe .
they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .
and cost is one of them .
but what this lets you do is gives you that all-important traction , and counter-traction , so that you can dissect , so that you can sew , all the surgical tasks .
so , with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all , and we can see it all .
in 2011 , we visited the vancouver waste transfer station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste .
to make the matter worse , phthalates are found in products to which we have a high exposure , such as babies &apos; toys , beverage containers , cosmetics , and even food wraps .
mw : so now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates , we wondered what these bacteria were .
two young scientists break down plastics with bacteria
here is something of the way they live .
and the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer was essentially that of a good host , anticipating the needs of the guest .
this is something called a splint .
the familiar one on the lower right .
charles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear .
these are some images from a project of mine that &apos;s called kymaerica .
but now i &apos;m going to return you to the real world .
if you &apos;re up the scale a little bit more , why , a brass thali .
i saw this leaflet and it said , &quot; there are millions of slaves in the world today . &quot;
but in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can &apos;t find any cases of slavery .
we needed medicine .
africans and indians , as usual , south americans , and eastern europeans in particular are on our buy list .
and if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this , it &apos;s that there are also -- in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved -- there are ex-slaves who are now working to free others .
in the united states , north america , much more expensive . legal costs , medical costs ...
i was frightened . we were frightened .
i know this . i &apos;ve spent most of my career researching these programs .
so specifically , if you hold constant your education , you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area , you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all .
there &apos;s a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy , and there &apos;s a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy , and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar , we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy .
is that something that you are still invested in , that you still believe in the notion of investment ?
now , the combination of both effects -- the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance -- is exactly a superconductor .
we have frictionless motion . it is still levitating , but can move freely all around .
this two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms , a small car , in my hand .
unfortunately , when i got there -- emerges ray .
and a good example of this is the rio tinto , which is in portugal .
and i went up to manchester to visit a place called axion recycling .
if i take 30 steps exponentially -- two , four , eight , 16 -- i get to a billion .
at least the exponential growth of information technology capability will continue unabated .
but that was really right on schedule .
what now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years .
this was in an area called wellawatta , a prime residential area in colombo .
but they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
and it &apos;s one that offers really interesting possibilities for organizing a whole host of activities down the road .
but there is a dark side to this , and that &apos;s what i want to spend the last part of my talk on .
but we know that occasionally ants go astray , and what happens is that , if army ants are wandering around and they get lost , they start to follow a simple rule -- just do what the ant in front of you does .
i got a day job , and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like , let &apos;s supply water to the world , and power to the world , and educate all the kids , which , chris , i will not talk about . i don &apos;t need another mission .
watch the fingers grab . the thumb comes up . wrist .
as you can see , these are the footprints of the different projects .
and so what they found , in fact , is that exploitation really began heavily with the romans .
and that &apos;s exactly what the pilot did for me .
now one of the nicest examples i like to cite on this is the story of two young women , high school students in new york city , who worked with the census .
so one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity ?
one of the things that we &apos;re taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive .
that means 91 percent , even after the census , still remain to be discovered .
and i could spend the rest of my time , which is getting very limited , going through this litany of concerns about the ocean , but i want to end on a more positive note .
as an architect , i have to confront something like this .
that &apos;s why we grow homes . thanks very much .
if you &apos;ve got reflux oesophagitis , there are 15 procedures , and joe schmo does it one way and will blow does it another way , and none of them work , and that &apos;s the way it is with this word , hope .
we feel it at concerts .
but beyond our compassion , and far greater than compassion , is our moral imagination and our identification with each individual who lives in that world , not to think of them as a huge forest , but as individual trees .
movement is the only way you have of affecting the world around you .
if you put a five year-old child &apos;s dexterity against the best robots of today , the answer is simple : the child wins easily .
so in my group , what we try to do is reverse engineer how humans control movement .
you want to generate beliefs about the world .
if you &apos;re playing against a very good opponent , they may distribute it in that green area , which is the prior distribution , making it hard for you to return .
now i get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act .
all we &apos;re playing with is a tempo causality .
and so here &apos;s player one and player two sitting opposite to each other .
having chosen a particular path , i can hold my hand on that path as infinitely many different joint configurations .
so what i can show you here is how the variability of the movement will evolve if i choose that way .
dw : so people have found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision is a mistake .
and yes , the red planet is red .
here are some recent images .
and what we &apos;re looking at is the presence of the gas methane , ch4 , in the atmosphere of mars .
in the southern hemisphere there are impact craters , there are volcanic craters .
we will have instruments aboard the plane that will sample , every three minutes , the atmosphere of mars .
how do we know we can do it ?
in this talk , planetary scientist joel levine shows some intriguing -- and puzzling -- new discoveries about mars : craters full of ice , traces of ancient oceans , and compelling hints at the presence , sometime in the past , of life . he makes the case for going back to mars to find out more . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so then once you do that you &apos;re like , &quot; oh , crap . where am i going to put all this ? &quot;
okay . anyway .
shortly after i saw that , we had some friends over for dinner with the family . the conversation turned to global warming , and everybody agreed , there &apos;s a real problem .
and , third , they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with led lighting .
it &apos;s hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don &apos;t know how much this stuff costs . do you know ?
well , we went to brazil to meet dr. jose goldemberg .
don &apos;t let me skip over that . better biofuels are a really big deal .
to size the problem , china &apos;s co2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons ; the u.s. is 5.8 . business as usual means we &apos;ll have 23 gigatons from china by 2050 .
&quot; i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it , &quot; john doerr says in an emotional talk about climate change and investment . to create a world fit for his daughter to live in , he says , we need to invest now in clean , green energy .
and the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning , let &apos;s say one or two people are infected , or affected by the thing and then they affect , or infect , two people , who in turn affect four , eight , 16 and so forth , and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve .
so , let me ask you this -- i can cultivate this intuition by asking a question -- who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network , a or b ?
and this , in essence , is what &apos;s known as the friendship paradox .
i should say that how far advanced a notice one might get about something depends on a host of factors .
they are surrounded by immunized people .
or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors , passively , and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within &#91; networks of &#93; doctors .
at these large-scale construction sites in china , you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process .
they typically make the best out of their conditions , and try to make their spaces look nice and homey , or at least up until as far as they can reach .
for years , the zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities , but in the early 1980s , they settled on the mokattam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city .
let &apos;s move across the map to china , to an area called shanxi , henan and gansu .
but fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time .
when soldiers came across roadside bombs in iraq and afghanistan , instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick , as they used to do up until about 2002 , they now send the robot out .
the eyes look ahead where the robot &apos;s going to move .
she &apos;s worked on the line for over 20 years .
that &apos;s happening statistically right now .
a surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard-pressed to produce maybe 500 points in a whole day .
it &apos;s used for studies , for visualization , as well as for education .
let me leave you with a final thought .
so 14 years ago , almost , in the middle of the rwandan genocide , in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated by the rwandan government and some extremist militia .
and that &apos;s what that moment with patricia schroeder i think shows : that if we are to bring about an end to the world &apos;s worst atrocities , we have to make it such .
now , what this movement has done is it has extracted from the bush administration from the united states , at a time of massive over-stretch -- military , financial , diplomatic -- a whole series of commitments to darfur that no other country in the world is making .
the second is , of course , that at this time in particular in america &apos;s history , we have a credibility problem , a legitimacy problem in international institutions .
started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the &apos; 70s were wars of independence and decolonization .
or do you continue feeding the civilians , knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps , literally sharpening their knives for future battle ?
here &apos;s this guy who got a 34-year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with , we as citizens are grappling with now . what do we take away ?
at a macro level , he thought , you know , we talk about democracy promotion , but we do it in a way sometimes that &apos;s an affront to people &apos;s dignity .
i think the short answer is : no , not unless we let it .
this is not a negotiable thing , hunger .
and we know that the issue is not just production of food .
and so today we focus on not just passing out food , but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment , and teaching them about breastfeeding .
but when that food is there , it &apos;s transformative .
and the food banks are growing .
in virtually every case , when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market -- if you say , &quot; we will buy 300 metric tons of this .
because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person , nation by nation .
well , if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value , you go to a doctor , they stick a needle in .
you then have some body part descriptions : &quot; it &apos;s in the liver , in the breast , in the prostate . &quot;
in health care today , we spend most of the dollars -- in terms of treating disease -- most of the dollars in the last two years of a person &apos;s life .
and he was saying : does he really want to meet another doctor ?
well , the bad news is that these robust -- and robust is a key word -- emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail .
i mean , this is a scary slide , not to take an aside , but it looks at obesity in the world .
they had to give it also in the u.s. to get approval , so i think there were three u.s. patients in upstate new york who were part of the trial .
and so we can accurately -- if the magnet is big enough , and your resolution is high enough -- you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding of the individual system .
there is a deep resonance with being at rest .
so if i were to play this -- -- for more than a few seconds , you &apos;d feel uncomfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you &apos;d be leaving the room in droves .
you all recognize that one . this is the most-played tune in the world today .
playing sound effects both pleasant and awful , julian treasure shows how sound affects us in four significant ways . listen carefully for a shocking fact about noisy open-plan offices .
he &apos;s trying to find and solve water issues , the crisis around the world .
and a year before that i was a pack-a-day smoker , living a very sedentary lifestyle .
it was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down .
water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain , sleet and snow , and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world , maybe in the universe .
imagine that . it &apos;s only seven miles , but only two people have been there , 49 years ago .
this is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea .
in the last three years , for example , the u.s. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments .
the goal is to protect biodiversity , to provide stability and resilience .
and so i want to show you a high-speed video sequence of a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second in infrared lighting , and to the right , off-screen , is an electronic looming predator that is going to go at the fly .
we have no idea what they do .
but let &apos;s take another animal just as an example . here &apos;s a mouse .
i would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works .
you can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display .
michael dickinson : how a fly flies
they are confused , and you cannot make a decision .
in fact , the neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed .
how many trees does it have ?
we can look at all 10 million synapses now .
take the magic carpet for a ride .
i &apos;m a historian .
it was the first project funded by arpa .
these are stills from film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn &apos;t and kept it in their basement for the last 40 years .
the sort of artist conceptions : these are basically powerpoint presentations given to the air force 40 years ago .
and i was quite excited about this . i was going to talk a little bit about research , a little bit about the kitchen .
if i asked you what &apos;s longer , the vertical line on the table on the left , or the horizontal line on the table on the right ?
i guess maybe if you &apos;re colorblind i don &apos;t think you can see that .
but it turns out that from organ donation they are very different .
how many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow , and you went to the dmv , and you would encounter one of these forms , that it would actually change your own behavior ?
you did not try ibuprofen .
what if it was a trip to rome , all expenses paid , transportation , breakfast , but doesn &apos;t include coffee in the morning .
i gave it to another 100 students . here is what happens .
this of course has two very clear implications for life in general .
do you know that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide ?
these radio waves penetrate through walls .
go to the main floor , you see these light bulbs .
and that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream .
so i &apos;ve mentioned to you the four challenges .
this is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean .
and that moved us to the next level .
really all you have to know about it is that there &apos;s four letters : a , t , c , g ; they represent the name of a chemical .
what are the exact instructions that are making it do that ?
in a human being , down in here it could be : make blood cells , start cancer .
it &apos;s , sort of , like booting up a pc with a mac o.s. software .
our ocean &apos;s teaming with microbes ; in fact , when craig venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean , in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water .
i told you i &apos;m going to make some of you puke .
what is genomics ? how will it affect our lives ? in this intriguing primer on the genomics revolution , entrepreneur barry schuler says we can at least expect healthier , tastier food . he suggests we start with the pinot noir grape , to build better wines .
male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy , because it prevents physical fights .
well , i &apos;ve got news for you .
basically , we follow a low-frequency behavior -- one the dog doesn &apos;t want to do -- by a high-frequency behavior , commonly known as a behavior problem , or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do .
and so we have to enforce , but without force .
how are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear ?
that child has lost everything -- that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet .
you know , calculus is wonderful .
and i want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation .
this diagram was our sort of position piece about the book , and our position was , books are technology -- that &apos;s something people forget -- but it &apos;s a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media .
on the left of that diagram , here , you &apos;ll see a series of five platforms -- sort of combs , collective programs .
so , now i &apos;m going to take you on a tour of the building .
and the very fact that they worked on a provisional space meant that for beckett they could blow out a wall ; they could do &quot; cherry orchard &quot; and blow a hole through the floor , and so forth .
open up entire portions for different kinds of events .
in fact -- and you know this -- this is called the time warner building .
william , hi . good to see you .
wk : i use a bicycle frame , and a pulley , and plastic pipe , what then pulls -- do we have a picture of that ? can we have the next slide ?
wk : thank you .
that &apos;s what it feels like to me .
i can see it in their eyes .
four is blue .
and in the right-hand corner , you don &apos;t have to calculate anything .
and if we think of that -- let me put the picture up -- the fibers represent vulnerability .
how did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
and it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because i think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
there &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
the stone axe was made by someone for himself .
it &apos;s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
there &apos;s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
it &apos;s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
what &apos;s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they &apos;re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
and in fact , this is one million plastic cups , which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the united states every six hours .
and , as you slowly step back , you see that it &apos;s a painting by van gogh , called &quot; skull with cigarette . &quot;
384,000 women , american women , last year went in for elective breast augmentation surgery .
and it will profoundly affect the well-being , the quality of life of the billions of people who are going to inherit the results of our decisions .
now , by the time we get out here to , let &apos;s say , acute bee paralysis virus -- probably a bad one to have if you &apos;re a bee --- this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus , but i can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved among these viruses on the right-hand of the screen are in identical regions right up here .
and so , that &apos;s a hard way to look at things , so i &apos;m just going to encode things as a little barcode , grouped by family , so you can see the results in a very intuitive way .
you have no idea what someone &apos;s going to cough into a cup , and it &apos;s probably really complex , right ?
these different blocks represent the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family , so you can kind of go down the blocks and see where the signal is .
10-day history of fevers , night sweats , bloody sputum -- she &apos;s coughing up blood -- muscle pain .
i mean , they went to the max for this woman .
and i &apos;m showing you the signal from the chip here , and i &apos;m showing you for the block of retroviral oligos .
this was all done by folks in the lab -- i cannot take credit for most of this .
the battery was invented about 200 years ago by a professor , alessandro volta , at the university of padua in italy .
you &apos;re looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter .
so to produce current , magnesium loses two electrons to become magnesium ion , which then migrates across the electrolyte , accepts two electrons from the antimony , and then mixes with it to form an alloy .
we &apos;ve operated over 400 of these , perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries -- not just magnesium and antimony .
avoid thermal runaway .
it &apos;s open source , meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online , allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design .
we &apos;ve also learned the penguins love robots .
and it wasn &apos;t until later , as i started making games , that -- i really actually think of them more as toys .
so as we eat , the camera starts pulling out , and then we start interacting with kind of larger and larger organisms .
here , i &apos;ll give it one eye in the middle , maybe scale it up a bit . point it down .
but i &apos;m going to skip way ahead here . now , normally what would happen is these creatures would work their way up , eventually become intelligent .
but there &apos;s a very simple little kind of calculation of what &apos;s required , how much plants are required for the herbivores to live , how many herbivores for the carnivores to eat , etc . , that you actually have to balance actively .
we actually have a couple of other planets in this solar system .
if we pull all the way back , we start seeing the entire galaxy here , kind of slowly in motion . and this is another thing where , typically when people present galaxies , it &apos;s always been these very beautiful photos , but they &apos;re always static . and when you actually bring it forward in time and start animating it , it &apos;s actually kind of amazing , what a galaxy would look like , fast forwarded .
we &apos;re going to come back to that in a few minutes , and i &apos;m hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit , it could significantly change the way your life unfolds .
and what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
i notice a couple of things about this .
physiologically , there also are differences on two key hormones : testosterone , which is the dominance hormone , and cortisol , which is the stress hormone .
here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
so this really spikes your cortisol .
so i really struggled with this , and i have to say , having your identity taken from you , your core identity , and for me it was being smart , having that taken from you , there &apos;s nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that .
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
it climbs up to the top , and it falls , and it climbs , and it falls , and it climbs -- trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass .
it was a term of abuse , in effect .
so it is important , i think , to richard , and to me , that these ideas not be abused and misused .
but in fact that &apos;s not why they went extinct .
they are wiping out traditions and practices .
there has to be , between me and the orchestra , an unshakable bond of trust , born out of mutual respect , through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in .
if you hold it too tightly , you crush it .
and i think , in no small way , that &apos;s due to one fundamental fact : they &apos;re not bound to a system of notation .
i think we should make this even more explicit .
of course there &apos;s a grimmer side to that truth , which is that it &apos;s actually taken decades for the world at large to come to a position of trust , to really believe that disability and sports can go together in a convincing and interesting fashion .
if any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point , please let me know .
i &apos;m working in kigali , rwanda , jogging through the steep slopes , when i see , 10 feet in front of me , a little boy -- 11 years old -- running toward me , wearing my sweater .
understand , however complex we may be , incentives matter .
where we work in aurangabad , the land is extraordinarily parched .
distribution is a nightmare , but not impossible .
children can sleep through the night ; the house looks beautiful ; you hang them in the window .
the second son took his third -- a third of 18 is six .
let me give you just a story , an example .
some years ago , i was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of russia and the leaders of chechnya .
there are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in africa than in the middle east .
now how would you -- now think about that for a moment .
so the idea came to me of what about inspiring a path , a route -- think the silk route , think the appalachian trail -- that followed in the footsteps of abraham .
they &apos;ve begun to walk in israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more walkers have come , and lately she &apos;s begun to earn an income to support her family .
so let me invite you to consider taking the third side , even as a very small step .
i am going to tell you how i do it and the most important thing i &apos;ve learned .
in other words , we can be politically right but emotionally wrong .
that &apos;s emotional correctness , and that &apos;s how we start the conversations that really lead to change .
almost all of my kids live below poverty .
and we started putting in roofs that look like this , and we came in from destitute neighborhoods to start building landscape like this , wow ! people noticed .
we are poised , ready , willing and able to export our talent and diversity in ways we &apos;ve never even imagined .
so we were onto something , and we &apos;re still onto something .
this is what we &apos;re doing .
forty percent attendance to 93 percent attendance .
teach them entrepreneurship . thank god for grownyc .
at the present time , it takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient , before that patient arrives at an emergency room .
there was the baseline -- first of all , a much bigger and more reliable signal .
we said , so we &apos;ll put in a stent , but we &apos;re not going to put in a stent that we &apos;d put in people .
they finally see you . it takes more time to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it , and it &apos;s hard to do because they don &apos;t have the baseline data , which the computer we put in you gets .
and here &apos;s one of the patients who has an aura and always has a headache , bad one , after the aura . what do we do ?
and this is the first device that we did , and i &apos;m going to talk about my second wish , which has something to do with this .
the advantages of responsive neurostimulation : it can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur , provide stimulation only when needed , can be turned off if seizures disappear ; it has minimal side effects -- as a matter of fact , in all our clinical trials to date , we &apos;ve seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it &apos;s been implanted -- and it &apos;s invisible , cosmetically hidden , so , if you have epilepsy and you have the device , no one will know it because you can &apos;t tell that it &apos;s there .
well , that &apos;s the good news .
then there &apos;s a simpler one and , oh yes , i understand that .
and so there is a team of developers from all over africa , who are part of this team now -- from ghana , from malawi , from kenya .
but now what ?
handwriting is a disappearing art .
ok , so these are lp records and they &apos;ve been replaced , right ?
think of it as a massive itunes for book type content .
companies like national instruments , who are embedding very powerful , interactive simulations into the materials , so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of textbook to an experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do .
and i think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing .
and people who are teachers out here , whoever taught , you know this -- it &apos;s the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about .
because in academic publishing and much of educational publishing , it &apos;s really this idea of sharing knowledge and making impact that &apos;s why people write , not necessarily making bucks .
i &apos;ve been at mit for 44 years . i went to ted i .
a little bit more recently , i got involved personally .
and the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down , and that &apos;s why i said seven to 10 million there .
the two pieces that are probably notable is it &apos;ll be a mesh network , so when the kids open up their laptops , they all become a network , and then just need one or two points of backhaul .
this is where when you go outside , it &apos;s in black and white .
you can spray paint it ; you can do anything you want .
nicholas negroponte , founder of the mit media laboratory , describes how the one laptop per child project will build and distribute the &quot; $ 100 laptop . &quot;
the other thing that happens is that you have a second self .
i was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders .
they &apos;re not just sitting there .
and you go into the town , and you inquire , &quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
so these programs -- and i &apos;m going to refer to pmtct though my talk -- these prevention programs , simply , they &apos;re the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies , and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children .
well , fortunately since 2001 , we &apos;ve got new treatments , new tests , and we &apos;re far more successful , but we don &apos;t have any more nurses .
take the same mother , and the nurse , after she gives her her test , takes her to a room .
now , doctors and nurses -- they too get trained .
and if we can change enough communities , we can change national attitudes .
mitchell besser : remember the images i showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in africa .
and so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in , we can do that .
and we also use functional mri , called fmri , to take a video , a movie , of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something .
so in my lab , we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan , we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people , their minds , their mental states , their emotions , and one of the findings that we &apos;ve found several times now , as have other labs around the world , is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex , which is shown in blue on the slide , and it &apos;s right in the middle of prefrontal cortex in the midline of your head .
they &apos;re parodied , sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage behavior . they take risks , they &apos;re sometimes moody , they &apos;re very self-conscious .
why do teenagers seem so much more impulsive , so much less self-aware than grown-ups ? cognitive neuroscientist sarah-jayne blakemore compares the prefrontal cortex in adolescents to that of adults , to show us how typically &quot; teenage &quot; behavior is caused by the growing and developing brain .
we started playing with this , and that afternoon , we realized that we could use this new , universal interface to allow anyone in the world to operate the robot in our lab .
we got a human , someone who &apos;s very outgoing and gregarious , and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment , cameras and microphones , and then a backpack with wireless internet connection , and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment , and then over the internet , people could experience what she was experiencing , so they could see what she was seeing , but then , more importantly , they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go , and then conveying those to the tele-actor .
so he &apos;s gotten robots to fly helicopters , do incredibly interesting , beautiful acrobatics , by watching human experts fly them .
i wish she could meet my dad .
mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think , to create in himself the things he most wanted for south africa : peace , reconciliation , harmony .
when i started professionally guiding people out into this environment , solly was my tracker .
i notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream .
danger is shared . pain is shared .
she attempted it a second time , and again , halfway up , she fell backwards .
and so that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to try and do , and that &apos;s what people all over south africa are trying to do .
what do we mean by beyond ourselves ?
i &apos;ve started outsourcing my memory to the digital world , you know ? but that comes with a problem .
as it turned out , next morning i wrote a letter to both of them , and shabana azmi replied , and came and launched my very first show 12 years ago .
education is great .
the food they produce have been proven to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals , and people have been eating food produced this way since the 1990s .
some people say organic or local food is more expensive , but is it really ?
if any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy , now is the time to check your blackberry .
and she was talking about seven-dimensional , inverted universes .
and broadly applicable across many platforms .
the u.n. -- you know , they took 20 years just to add a flap to a tent , but i think we have some more exciting things .
buy &quot; the purpose-driven life , &quot; or satan will take your soul .
so first , one of the problems with monterey is that if there is global warming and greenland melts as you say , the ocean level is going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center .
satirist tom rielly delivers a wicked parody of the 2006 conference , taking down the $ 100 laptop , the plight of the polar bear , and people who mention , one too many times , that they work at harvard . watch for a special moment between tom and al gore .
but the ocean-protected area is basically flat line until right about now -- it appears to be ticking up .
it &apos;s an interesting fact .
well they exist in the republic of kiribati , and kiribati is located in the central pacific in three island groups .
so i started contacting them -- because they had actually given me a permit to do this -- and i said , &quot; i want to come up and tell you what we found . &quot;
it had occurred on land , in rainforests of south america and africa , where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down .
and that &apos;s the story with climate-change heating .
aboard mission blue , scientist greg stone tells the story of how he helped the republic of kiribati create an enormous protected area in the middle of the pacific -- protecting fish , sealife and the island nation itself .
it was written by an algorithm .
and then other people will say , &quot; no , actually , the big stories , the big developments are the founding of the world &apos;s major religions , which have changed civilizations and have changed and influenced how countless people are living their lives . &quot; and then some other folk will say , &quot; actually , what changes civilizations , what modifies them and what changes people &apos;s lives are empires , so the great developments in human history are stories of conquest and of war . &quot;
i hear once in a while , &quot; okay , i &apos;ll grant you that , but technology is still a tool for the rich world , and what &apos;s not happening , these digital tools are not improving the lives of people at the bottom of the pyramid . &quot;
and it turned out that -- i just went to see , you know , what they are doing in hong kong .
while , somewhat , the spaniards ...
they divided up the different subway lines and added their own version .
and other people go and fill them in .
and this was two weeks ago .
most old people in the u.s. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years , and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly , whereas in traditional societies , older people instead live out their lives among their children , their other relatives , and their lifelong friends .
in contrast , in traditional societies without writing , older people are the repositories of information .
that means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people , and that each old person has less individual value .
unlike other caregivers , grandparents don &apos;t quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby .
but there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies , and perhaps to be learned from them .
superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens , or krypton , but he &apos;s sent in a pod , much like moses was on the nile .
and now it &apos;s 2010 , and there are 99 heroes from 99 different countries .
and he controls them from the top down -- whereas when they work for the other side , eventually , when they find out this is the wrong person , they &apos;ve been manipulated , they actually , each one has a different , colorful kind of dress .
and this is one of my favorites , al-batina from yemen .
&quot; so when &apos;s the article coming out ? &quot;
i need more light .
miklos : no . he gave me access , and you want to reboot the &#91; unclear &#93; . no more &#91; unclear &#93; .
this is islam &apos;s influence on hinduism and judaism .
on april 26 , 2010 , president barack obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous cairo speech -- in which he reached out to the muslim world -- the most innovative was that the 99 reach back out to the justice league of america .
then of course , the iraq war , predicted to cost just 60 billion back in 2003 .
so these are what our fears look like over time in our media .
but it &apos;s a really fertile medium , and it feels like visualizations , infographics , data visualizations , they feel like flowers blooming from this medium .
i &apos;ve never studied art or anything .
if you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind , which is about words and numbers and concepts , you start speaking two languages simultaneously , each enhancing the other .
again , chiming with your view that china has a militarized regime ready to , you know , mobilize its enormous forces .
and it was incredibly frustrating for me because i had a book of 250 visualizations to do for my book , and i spent a month doing this , and i only filled two pages .
so , just to wrap up , i wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions , and information design is about solving information problems .
the lush heart note , melaleuca bark note -- which does not contain any melaleuca bark , because it &apos;s totally forbidden .
why doesn &apos;t it smell of potatoes or violets ? well , there are really two theories .
a theory is something that enables you to do less work .
now , after searching high and low for several months , i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a borane which has exactly the same vibration .
ok . now . if something absorbs the energy , the electron can travel .
and we actually , in this case , i &apos;m sorry to say , it happened -- it was serendipitous .
that &apos;s europe . &quot; but , yeah .
and so what i want to do with you in , oh god , only 10 minutes , is to really think again this juxtaposition , because it actually has massive , massive implications beyond innovation policy , which just happens to be the area that i often talk with with policymakers .
it was actually shaping and creating markets .
well , there &apos;s a self-fulfilling prophecy .
and yet we know they legally , as many other companies , pay very little tax back .
i &apos;ve had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country .
and the irs has introduced the program .
and why have we not made the connection , between — how has that happened ? — between these incredible characters of popular culture and religions , and the fostered , adopted or orphaned child in our midst ? it &apos;s not our pity that they need .
it was a summer of love if you were white .
they &apos;ve had three other children . i &apos;m the fourth . the third was an accident .
the man who ran it was an ex-army officer .
she said , &quot; they don &apos;t want , like , the angry black man . &quot;
they operated 10 to 3 . they were closed for lunch hour .
i said one day , well , look , if the science says -- this is science , not me -- that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime -- you see where they are in june and say , okay , they &apos;re there .
yes , there &apos;ll be some place , because some folks will do the right thing .
i used to make stuff up . right ?
i need to know you &apos;re struggling , and i need to know whether or not what i did corrected that .
but we can &apos;t confuse figuring out the science and things not working with we shouldn &apos;t therefore do anything .
the real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about .
why , why , why does our education system look so similar to the way it did 50 years ago ? millions of students were failing then , as they are now -- and it &apos;s because we &apos;re clinging to a business model that clearly doesn &apos;t work . education advocate geoffrey canada dares the system to look at the data , think about the customers and make systematic shifts in order to help greater numbers of kids excel .
why do they do that ? why do old ladies go to those hair shops , and make those helmets ?
you think we want you to do it , but we don &apos;t want you to do it .
lean against me , calm your fears , count thy blessings , not thy years .
what of the titans of media ?
we feasted and reveled and rutted in muck , forgetting our peril , forgetting to duck , forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives .
cloning will transform everything . voice navigation will transform everything .
it was absolutely unbelievable .
media big shot felix dennis roars his fiery , funny , sometimes racy original poetry , revisiting haunting memories and hard-won battle scars from a madcap -- yet not too repentant -- life . best enjoyed with a glass of wine .
we still really haven &apos;t got a very complete picture of it .
and if you look north here , there &apos;s a big river that flows into the lake that &apos;s been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there .
and he remained there until 1.6 million years later , when this very famous fossil hunter , kamoya kimeu , walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles , recognized it as being hominid .
i think it &apos;s our collective intelligence .
i &apos;ll leave it at that , thank you very much .
and one day , a couple of weeks later , it might have been maybe a year later , i was in the art store with my kids , and i was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day .
you can see that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo .
it &apos;s funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it , because i can see it compared to this thing , and i can tell you -- it &apos;s real , it &apos;s the real thing , it &apos;s made from the exact same mold that this one is .
john &apos;s grill , which actually is seen briefly in &quot; the maltese falcon , &quot; is still a viable san francisco eatery , counted amongst its regular customers elisha cook , who played wilmer cook in the movie , and he gave them one of his original plasters of the maltese falcon .
and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one , it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch .
i &apos;d broken my neck and my back in six places .
they said to my parents , the neck break was a stable fracture , but the back was completely crushed .
i had one arm in plaster , one arm tied down by drips .
but you &apos;re going to get home and realize how different life is . &quot;
and then i thought to myself , maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start .
i go , &quot; great . &quot; and so they drive me down , they get me out on the tarmac , and there was this red , white and blue airplane .
and then i made great progression to the point where i could walk around the house , holding onto the walls , like this , and mom said she was forever following me , wiping off my fingerprints .
and then it no longer matters what you look like , where you come from , or what you do for a living .
i &apos;ll begin with this concept of what i call dna .
this is the final product . when they sent it to me , i thought i &apos;d failed .
how that flows through me and how that comes out is what i &apos;m trying to understand .
it shows how you make one holistic form , like the car industry , and then you break up what you need .
they &apos;re very big prints . but this is how i get to that object .
some guy &apos;s got that on a computer -- there &apos;s this like , oh my goodness .
its cars are made from 30,000 components .
this is the steriolithography of a staircase .
so i &apos;m just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you &apos;ll see in the video .
we need to have a new instinct for the 21st century .
in the ocean , it &apos;s the rule rather than the exception .
so , if you stagger into the head late at night and you &apos;re so toilet-hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light , you may think that you &apos;re having a religious experience .
this is a christmas tree of a fish ; everything on this fish lights up , it &apos;s not just that lure .
and there are a lot of different animals that can do this : there &apos;s jellyfish , there &apos;s squid , there &apos;s a whole lot of different crustaceans , there &apos;s even fish that can do this .
i &apos;ve made hundreds of dives in submersibles .
and i know this footage isn &apos;t going to look like anything to you -- we had a crummy camera at the time -- but i was ecstatic .
you don &apos;t need anybody &apos;s permission to create something great .
so the different elements of the project are all open , so the hardware is released with a creative commons license .
mr : it should do a pretty good job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details of kim kardashian &apos;s wedding .
so very serious project .
the last project i want to show you is this : it &apos;s called ardusat . it &apos;s currently on kickstarter , so if you want to contribute , please do it .
i was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
and in those days , i developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass .
a is my office , b is the place where the duck hit the glass , and c is from where i watched it .
after winning this prize , my life changed .
this is mad max , a blackbird who lives in rotterdam .
in 2003 , i started a project with computer scientist adam montandon , and the result , with further collaborations with peter kese from slovenia and matias lizana from barcelona , is this electronic eye .
so today i &apos;m dressed in c major , so it &apos;s quite a happy chord .
it &apos;s justin bieber &apos;s &quot; baby . &quot;
if you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town , people will move there .
at the end of this day i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher .
of course , this is utopia ; it &apos;s a formula for paralysis , not freedom .
public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in america say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom .
so , none of these people are doing what they think is right .
so , what &apos;s needed is not just to limit claims , but actually create a dry ground of freedom .
we have to rehumanize the law .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happened to america . look around .
more and more rules to protect us against an indifferent , uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with .
and he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel problems -- problems that they hadn &apos;t anticipated .
it &apos;s the case of michael .
but it turned out the prosecutor was not happy that judge forer ignored the sentencing guidelines and sort of invented her own , and so he appealed .
people have to make a living .
so these are little ordinary , everyday heroes , and they &apos;re incredibly admirable , but there &apos;s no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down .
there are now 22 cities that have veterans &apos; courts like this .
and ken and i believe that this is what practitioners actually want .
so if you have a traditional perception of terrorism , it would be that it &apos;s one of criminality , one of war .
you know , there &apos;s nothing heroic about killing a young kid .
now , lady in 15j was a suicide bomber amongst us all .
there was a famous irish terrorist who once summed up the point very beautifully . he said , &quot; the thing is , about the british government , is , is that it &apos;s got to be lucky all the time , and we only have to be lucky once . &quot;
some of those victims said enough is enough .
there &apos;s practical problems .
maybe the rolling stones has a place in this .
chapter one is 1949 to 1991 , when the soviet union broke up , and what we were dealing with , at that point and through those years , was a superpowers &apos; nuclear arms race .
many buildings , public buildings , around the country -- this is new york city -- had these little civil defense signs , and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters and be safe from the nuclear weaponry .
and there &apos;s four key ingredients to describing that .
the third element of the nuclear terror threat is that , who would actually do such a thing ?
this is the size of the &quot; little boy &quot; bomb that was dropped at hiroshima .
and what happens is -- this is -- i &apos;m going to show you now some fallout plumes . within 20 minutes , it comes straight down . within 24 hours , lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds , and it &apos;s mostly in this particular direction -- it &apos;s going northeast .
in conclusion , nuclear war is less likely than before , but by no means out of the question , and it &apos;s not survivable .
now , i think many have seen business as the problem , or at least one of the problems , in many of the social challenges we face .
these problems still seem very daunting and very intractable , and any solutions we &apos;re achieving are small solutions .
only business can actually create resources .
the conventional wisdom in economics and the view in business has historically been that actually , there &apos;s a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance .
issue by issue by issue , we start to learn that actually there &apos;s no trade-off between social progress and economic efficiency in any fundamental sense .
it &apos;s real . it &apos;s happening .
our digital body is one-to-one life size , so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy .
oops ! ...
it &apos;s a female now .
after this , they were scientists , professionals with a particular scientific method , goals , societies and funding .
for example , ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports .
and for the first time , they gave women a foot in the door of science .
so i have a strange career .
because , yes , if you see something like this , then all right , fine , i &apos;m going to call it life -- no doubt about it .
and it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts .
and of course , since i really don &apos;t know how to write code , i had help in this .
can we measure this type of life ?
and here &apos;s the result .
i can tell you indeed it is , because this type of spectrum , just like what you &apos;ve seen in books , and just like what you &apos;ve seen in amino acids , it doesn &apos;t really matter how you change the environment , it &apos;s very robust ; it &apos;s going to reflect the environment .
and that in a sense removes us again , like all of our scientific discoveries , or many of them -- it &apos;s this continuous dethroning of man -- of how we think we &apos;re special because we &apos;re alive .
we have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics .
i can tell you , i often wasn &apos;t really paying attention .
because if we can do that , if we can actually just collect the data electronically , digitally , from the very beginning , we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of typing , of having somebody type that stuff into the computer .
and so i began to think of ways in which i could basically take myself out of the picture .
you can create forms , and once you &apos;ve created the forms , you push them to a variety of common mobile phones .
what &apos;s changed now is , instead of having a program in which we &apos;re scaling at such a slow rate that we can never reach all the people who need us , we &apos;ve made it unnecessary for people to get reached by us .
but how do we do that ?
because we will throw away these political dogmas .
we are burning , as you heard , so much energy , not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life cannot last for long .
and when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington , together with the airplane of charles lindbergh , with apollo 11 , with the wright brothers &apos; flyer , with chuck yeager &apos;s 61 , i had really a thought then .
you need 64 meter wingspan .
the same time we load the batteries , we run the engines , and when we get at the maximum height , we arrive at the beginning of the night .
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team .
i hope , i believe .
they called me , &quot; the girl with the beard . &quot;
the next thing i &apos;d like to be clear about is what this problem is , and what this problem isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s crazy , really , when you think about it .
and let &apos;s cut the crap for a second .
we can turn the inevitable outcomes , and transform the quality of life for millions of lives who look and feel rather like us , when you &apos;re up close .
you see , idealism detached from action is just a dream .
putting it in the crassest possible terms , the investment reaps huge returns .
the war against terror , yes .
anyway , so i &apos;d like your help in getting that signed up .
please join us by working together .
communication is very important for ethiopia -- will transform the country .
elvis uses it , but so does shakespeare in this famous line from &quot; romeo and juliet : &quot; juliet is the sun .
sexually attractive people are hot .
those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that price trends would continue .
ralph waldo emerson described language as &quot; fossil poetry . &quot;
i love this picture .
i wish you could see yemen through my eyes .
brought in younger men .
we started with , you can take it off in the office .
and i just wanted to share with you : there &apos;s one reporter that came .
it &apos;s natural .
thankfully , i met reda girgis , who is dry as toast , but he and his team at johns hopkins didn &apos;t just want me to survive , they wanted me to live a meaningful life .
literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my spanx , hoping the doors wouldn &apos;t open unexpectedly .
i was dying , and if i didn &apos;t mix that stuff up fast , i would never leave that apartment alive .
it was my doctor in cleveland , marie budev .
there were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body .
and these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors .
these are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testes , two ovaries , another large testis , more ovaries , which is not normal ...
and there have been many , many , many studies that have shown that bpa leaches from babies &apos; bottles into the formula , into the milk , and therefore into the babies .
and as a result , when those rats grow up , their pups experience retarded growth and development because they can &apos;t make enough milk to nourish their pups .
and this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when i found out i was pregnant and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat .
the problem is , in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , we don &apos;t see that connection .
notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean , at the base of the food chain , was ingesting these poison pills .
nobody knows how old the oldest living coast redwoods are because nobody has ever drilled into any of them to count their annual growth rings , and , in any case , the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow .
you &apos;re like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant , and most of the organism is overhead , unseen .
this is my daughter laura , then 15 , looking out of a tree boat .
redwoods grow very slowly in their tops .
redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space , and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk , going back into the main trunk and fusing with it .
the eastern hemlock forest is being considered in some ways the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the mississippi river .
it &apos;s an amazing sense of wonder you &apos;ve given me , and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is .
growing up , i decided i wanted to become a doctor and save lives .
we &apos;re not interested in your help . &quot; and he threw me out of the room .
the reasons why we &apos;re so successful are because of three things .
something special happened .
i guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob , and it works .
now , 1986 .
so let me just mount some drives . go over there .
it &apos;s gangs like -- let &apos;s go to gangstabucks.com .
u.s. officials , just a couple of weeks ago , froze a swiss bank account belonging to mr. jain , and that bank account had 14.9 million u.s. dollars on it .
and we can go here and actually start decrypting it .
because he blogged about the car .
i mean , we have critical infrastructure .
what i &apos;m going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict , and illustrate it with some predictions about what iran is going to do in the next couple of years .
pretty much everybody is rational .
suppose we double the number of influencers from five to 10 .
so with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have , what the chances are that they &apos;re willing to take , what they &apos;re after , what they value , what they want , and what they believe about other people .
the yellow line shows us the most likely path .
again , whether we &apos;re talking health policy , education , environment , energy , litigation , mergers , all of these are complicated problems that are predictable , that this sort of technology can be applied to .
youtube cares deeply about the rights of content owners , but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies , mashups and more , we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site .
well , it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts , and that looked like the end of the story , but sometime last year , a young couple got married .
and each of these can vary by country .
these women are descendants of polynesian navigators , trained in the old ways by their elders , and now they &apos;re passing it on to me .
he &apos;s also considered the greatest wave finder in the world .
just as the women in hawaii that raised me predicted , the world is in trouble .
thank you . i have to tell you i &apos;m both challenged and excited .
they &apos;re only going to get magnified by the very technology that &apos;s connecting us , because it &apos;s making us intersect . and that intersection doesn &apos;t always create the view of &quot; everybody now understands everybody , and everybody appreciates everybody . &quot;
so , the question we &apos;ve got to ask ourselves really is , what is it ?
idiot , robbins . but i know when we watched the debate at that time , there were emotions that blocked people &apos;s ability to get this man &apos;s intellect and capacity .
the history of our world is these decisions .
which , i believe -- it &apos;s not your desires .
you can do it by being more spiritual .
and it &apos;s exciting . when you see nicholas up here talking about his $ 100 computer , the most passionate exciting thing is : here &apos;s a genius , but he &apos;s got a calling now .
i &apos;d say one of the parts of the map is like time . some people &apos;s idea of a long time is 100 years . somebody else &apos;s is three seconds , which is what i have .
all i can tell you is , i brought this man on stage with a man from new york who worked in the world trade center , because i had about 200 new yorkers there . more than 50 lost their entire companies , their friends , marking off their palm pilots -- one financial trader , this woman made of steel , bawling -- 30 friends crossing off that all died .
and it appears that , some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night , until she reappeared in the morning .
and as that &apos;s happened , people have been leaving behind footprints , footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression .
and then , one by one , in reverse chronological order , they excuse themselves , entering the scrolling list of feelings .
finally , location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings .
so as you can see , we feel fine uses a technique that i call &quot; passive observation . &quot;
and it started to make me think a lot about the night sky , and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories .
and those are the constellations of today .
you can see that this is an important story ; there are a lot of things in its orbit . if we open this up , we get different perspectives on this story .
have you ever noticed how much people moan about them ?
they &apos;re like nature &apos;s version of those inkblot images , you know , that shrinks used to show their patients in the &apos; 60s , and i think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds , you &apos;ll save money on psychoanalysis bills .
it &apos;s like a bit of everyday meditation .
to be there is to be connected in the driving rain and the hail , to feel connected to our atmosphere .
it &apos;s really a huge challenge for us .
so we have to do something that &apos;s a little bit more intelligent than doing this .
so this is really what &apos;s enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine , together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms -- compressing data , extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on .
so in the morning , in between six and seven in the morning , the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the ct scanners .
one of the things that i &apos;m really , really happy is our virtual autopsy table .
and then i can feel the brain inside , and this will be the slushy like this .
and this is something that we &apos;ve been researching for a little while .
and i think this is a great application for the future of this technology , because there &apos;s very little known about the animal anatomy .
and a good place to start is your own paycheck .
now , it looks like you &apos;re doing yourself out of a job , but you &apos;re not . you &apos;re actually making yourself more useful .
they &apos;re challenging the idea that if you want something to be affordable it &apos;s got to be one-size-fits-all .
but the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane , physical details .
how much would that change the rules ?
nevertheless , i -- as i &apos;m sure -- as a rather irritating young , white man coming into their village , i was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth .
well , i &apos;m not going to explain this equation , but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject .
the gap is very tiny , and i &apos;ve blown it up so you can see it .
what about africa ?
and while i was busy working -- i was working on these colliding worlds , in the day .
you have to rethink , what is the university for ?
and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green .
shehu : and from there we will be able to , hopefully , make better predictions and then we compare it to the graph and also make some predictions .
we want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers , as it does at aims .
accepting his 2008 prize , physicist neil turok speaks out for talented young africans starved of opportunity : by unlocking and nurturing the continent &apos;s creative potential , we can create a change in africa &apos;s future .
so what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by 1,200 houses , the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop .
and this is a little protein molecule .
that &apos;s the red path that &apos;s highlighted .
let me explain what you &apos;re going to see , ok , because it &apos;s putting out different kinds of information , it &apos;s not as straightforward as a camera .
and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .
so , despite the fact that i &apos;m going to talk to you about an object that &apos;s supermassive , and i &apos;m going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no finite size .
okay , so , i &apos;m going to talk about no ordinary black hole ; i &apos;m going to talk about supermassive black holes .
so , there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies .
so , i want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible .
now , most astronomers have a favorite star , and mine today is a star that &apos;s labeled up there , so-2 .
so , what i want to tell you , very briefly , is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today or at least we believe , that there is a supermassive black hole there .
to make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away .
and he did a painting of this experience , which he called &quot; in the realm of music . &quot;
but what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down , to condense them to their absolute essence , and from that essence create a new language , a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are .
and then in the 13th century , more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly , and that led to the kind of notation we have today .
and the how was harmony , stacking up the pitches to form chords .
where does it go ? what &apos;s left ?
and he said , &quot; yes , yes . i was a little boy .
but kites aren &apos;t just toys like this .
as you can tell , you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours .
i am lucky enough to work with 30 of them .
i think yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose .
gh : ok . one . two . three .
he &apos;s doing tricks here , dance tricks , that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before .
the bigger the crowd , the more potential innovators there are .
and it &apos;s important to note that it &apos;s not just the stars who are benefiting : because you can see the best , everyone can learn .
you know , we &apos;ve heard that this week -- this romantic notion of the lone genius with the &quot; eureka ! &quot; moment that changes the world is misleading .
and a global community of unicyclists discover each other online , inspire each other to greatness .
reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions .
so , we &apos;re dreaming of ways to make it easier for you , the global ted community , to respond to speakers , to contribute your own ideas , maybe even your own tedtalks , and to help shine a light on the very best of what &apos;s out there .
i &apos;m one of the organizers of tedxkibera .
and that &apos;s a huge amount of data .
if i don &apos;t understand something , i can just say , &quot; etc . , etc . &quot;
in a brilliantly tongue-in-cheek analysis , sebastian wernicke turns the tools of statistical analysis on tedto come up with a metric for creating &quot; the optimum tedtalk &quot; based on user ratings . how do you rate it ? &quot; jaw-dropping &quot; ? &quot; unconvincing &quot; ? or just plain &quot; funny &quot; ?
if you want to compare oranges to windshields , what do you do ?
here &apos;s another couple . he &apos;s projecting out at us , and she &apos;s clearly projecting , you know , love and admiration at him .
that just gives you an example of the kind of thing that these games probe . the interesting thing is , these games require that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line .
we think there &apos;s a future to this . but it &apos;s our way of going in and redefining , with a new lexicon , a mathematical one actually , as opposed to the standard ways that we think about mental illness , characterizing these diseases , by using the people as birds in the exchanges . that is , we exploit the fact that the healthy partner , playing somebody with major depression , or playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder , or playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , we use that as a kind of biosensor , and then we use computer programs to model that person , and it gives us a kind of assay of this .
because there isn &apos;t going to be a lot of money to improve public services , or to improve government , or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about .
this was the pre-bureaucratic age , an age in which everything had to be local .
now here , on one website , one state in america , every single dollar spent by that government is searchable , is analyzable , is checkable .
how do you do it ?
the leader of britain &apos;s conservative party says we &apos;re entering a new era -- where governments themselves have less power and people empowered by technology have more . tapping into new ideas on behavioral economics , he explores how these trends could be turned into smarter policy .
the u.s. isn &apos;t number one .
we also had students fill out surveys with questions like , &quot; does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson ? &quot;
once i &apos;m finished taping , then i put it in my computer , and then i &apos;ll scan it and take a peek at it .
this wouldn &apos;t just make us a more successful country .
none of my previous experience prepared me for what came next . can you guess ?
as a matter of fact , diy people from all over the world , america , europe , got together last year , and we hammered out a common code of ethics .
in a biohacker space , you can analyze your genome for mutations .
and so it invited workers from around the world to come and help it build the nation .
who here has been touched by hiv -- either because you yourself have the virus or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague who is living with hiv ?
shereen el-feki : it &apos;s not just a question of unfair or ineffective laws .
now there are still many problems .
and hey , surprise , very high rates of hiv among people who are injecting drugs .
laws that treat people living with hiv or those at greatest risk with respect start with the way that we treat them ourselves : as equals .
and we still live in that world , and this is what we end up with .
so with cities , you also have congestion and pollution and disease and all these negative things .
the highline in manhattan is very similar .
you know , bike lanes are mostly used by young guys in stretchy pants , you know . so -- we think we can develop a vehicle that operates on bike lanes , accessible to elderly and disabled , women in skirts , businesspeople , and address the issues of energy congestion , mobility , aging and obesity simultaneously . that &apos;s our challenge .
so if you can have folding and autonomy , you can do that in one seventh of the space .
it &apos;s a global imperative . we have to get this right .
probably the best documented basking shark fishery in the world is that from achill island .
and another title would be &quot; liop an da lapa , &quot; the unwieldy beast with two fins .
so we concentrated mainly in north donegal and west kerry as the two areas where i was mainly active .
that &apos;s nine and a half thousand kilometers . we never thought that happened .
and it &apos;s thought maybe it was a bottleneck , a genetic bottleneck thought to be 12,000 years ago , and this has caused a very low diversity .
so where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis ?
so i scraped it off .
and in about half an hour , we got five samples , five individual sharks , were sampled using simon &apos;s shark slime sampling system .
but for the time being , thank you for that .
so here &apos;s a disclaimer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
i felt like i was performing this elaborate act .
i was not an activist .
my goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
interestingly , i asked this question when i was a little kid .
and that &apos;s the key : it &apos;s about power .
interrogators from titan corporation , all there , and they &apos;re getting no information about the insurgency .
and this is where the power is of the bad-barrel makers .
we want men between 20 and 50 . &quot;
they said only one percent . because that &apos;s sadistic behavior , and we know , psychiatry knows , only one percent of americans are sadistic .
the kids who were going to be prisoners , we said , &quot; wait at home in the dormitories . the study will begin sunday . &quot;
we know in some cultures , they go to war , they don &apos;t change their appearance .
real world parallels ? compare this with this .
our traditional societal heroes are wrong , because they are the exceptions .
heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary . who act .
because it may only happen once in your life , and when you pass it by , you &apos;ll always know , i could have been a hero and i let it pass me by .
this is not a person that is being studied at autopsy .
and it &apos;s quite clear that , in order to make minds , we need to construct neural maps .
and the great beauty is that you can then go from memory , out of those association cortices , and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception .
and the final thing is that there is a very tight coupling between the regulation of our body within the brain and the body itself , unlike any other coupling .
you cannot have a conscious mind if you don &apos;t have the interaction between the brain stem and the body .
primates are extremely curious -- and humans most of all .
so while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons , i was watching very esoteric documentaries made by and about women .
but for me , so is immigration .
the mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic , and i think it &apos;s much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed .
she was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co-organize a group called the service women &apos;s action network .
blogger courtney martin examines the perennially loaded word &quot; feminism &quot; in this personal and heartfelt talk . she talks through the three essential paradoxes of her generation &apos;s quest to define the term for themselves .
it &apos;s really only a successful escape .
the shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what &apos;s going on in my head .
we realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you .
you have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing -- not just how much rope you used or what your high score is , but what was going on inside of your mind .
or you could tag facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention , just like this .
i look forward to the day that i can sit beside you , easel-side , watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves .
i can &apos;t see this clock and i can &apos;t see the timing , so holy god , woohoo !
but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face .
can i tell you , airports are a disaster .
he thought i was mad enough anyway .
look where my belief had brought me to .
i didn &apos;t speak hindi . i &apos;d never been to india . hadn &apos;t a clue .
but as i was traveling here , you &apos;ll be very happy to know , i did use my white symbol stick cane , because it &apos;s really good to skip queues in the airport .
but not all , a few are still alive .
there &apos;s a weird sense of mastery you get when you know some bit of boomer trivia that mom and dad don &apos;t know .
but as the years went on , as ibm started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this , i started to get occasional updates from them , and i started to get a little more worried .
you must come to it ; you must make the pilgrimage .
so it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be .
there &apos;s just too much .
but not on that beach , not on mai khao beach , because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before .
it &apos;s always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in &quot; 2001 . &quot;
sometimes you just want to stand there silently , alone with your thoughts .
the circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness than the sense of control we feel over our lives .
we merely have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model .
which isn &apos;t a great idea .
the likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle .
they believed that there was a discipline called praxeology , which is a prior discipline to the study of economics .
if that seems like some strange , abstruse thing , in the u.k. , the post office had a 98 percent success rate at delivering first-class mail the next day .
so if you do something that &apos;s perceptually bad in one respect , you can damage the other .
when we have enough of them , we &apos;re going to have a nation that &apos;s not worth defending .
because this was perceived to be a weather problem .
we have to do good buildings .
so every effort is made to keep them within the building .
we &apos;re not ready for what &apos;s coming at us .
you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets .
this was really embarrassing when it happened , until i realized it could have been worse .
and he emailed me this picture .
one young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother .
tinkering school doesn &apos;t follow a set curriculum , and there are no tests .
yay !
so they rightly regarded this drug as a failure , and its commercial development was stopped , and because its commercial development was stopped , this trial was never published .
but when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature , what they found was a very different picture .
and if you want to read the full correspondence and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company , you can see that written up in this week &apos;s edition of plos medicine .
what we see here are satellites around the earth and the earth in proper registration against the universe , as we see .
this software can also be networked between domes .
and i &apos;d add to that , that it &apos;s not just making it , but everybody , each of us , everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way , and that &apos;s one of the main parts of my work .
maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones , you can find somebody who can &apos;t recognize their face in the mirror , or can &apos;t tell anyone in their family , but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing . and with that you can bring back parts of people &apos;s memories and personalities .
these robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character , simon powers , and his family . there are a whole series of them , kind of like a greek chorus .
tod machover : and we &apos;re really excited to have you here , really dan .
so he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into hyperscore .
and i &apos;d like to think if this was the case , they probably would have rehearsed it a few times .
scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation .
i was creating commitment devices of my own long before i knew what they were .
you say , &quot; well , of course i can &apos;t write today , because i &apos;m giving a tedtalk and i have five media interviews , and then i &apos;m going to a cocktail party and then i &apos;ll be drunk after that .
each outcome is shown by one of these markers , and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement .
so this is one of our experiments .
and what &apos;s good is , unlike in the experiments that hal and myself ran with russ smith , you don &apos;t have to program these by yourself in order to see the virtual reality .
one problem is there are some sounds in arabic that just don &apos;t make it through a european voice box without lots of practice .
the difference in the quality of medical care received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons why they live shorter lives than people without mental illness .
any case , i went on , i soldiered on with psychiatry , and found myself training in britain in some of the best hospitals in this country . i was very privileged .
and importantly , we need to reallocate the few specialists who are available to perform roles such as capacity-building and supervision .
but it &apos;s not that straightforward .
no matter what level you look at , whether it &apos;s at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level , we see the same problem again and again .
the green represents the percentage .
and here &apos;s what the same calculation looks like , which was done recently -- well i say recently , over the last 10 years -- by a group called trucost .
and actually we &apos;ve done this with the teeb project .
has already set up a coalition to do this , an international coalition .
as you can see , they cut across the entire globe all the way from micronesia across indonesia , malaysia , india , madagascar and to the west of the caribbean .
he was brash , irreverent -- he was full of macho , a kind of macho one-upmanship .
one after another , they came in and ordered feynman sandwiches .
feynman let them have it -- both barrels , right between the eyes .
we were up in the mountains , and feynman said to me , he said , &quot; leonardo . &quot;
and for some time , he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well .
the first one was that when helium atoms touch each other , they repel .
but you couldn &apos;t ; they were just too complicated .
i think the answer is we should honor feynman by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can .
what i had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell .
the trailers themselves are actually hand-built .
and what i now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress .
number three -- throw a spear .
this is -- this is a great stage for a kid .
what &apos;s the plan ? well , we propose to leave millions of children behind , and here &apos;s how it &apos;s going to work .
like , &quot; which one are you ? remind me .
now the reason i say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here , if i can say so , has been to de-professionalize teachers .
but they should not be the dominant culture of education .
instead , what we have is a culture of standardization .
the second is that they attribute a very high status to the teaching profession .
and they work .
&quot; there are three sorts of people in the world : those who are immovable , people who don &apos;t get , they don &apos;t want to get it , they &apos;re going to do anything about it .
kevin stone : and so , the mission is : how do i treat these things biologically ?
but what happens for your ligament when i need an intact ligament ?
it &apos;s bioware .
we are living at the age here at the end of the book , where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it .
so you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects .
and once we create new patterns in this brain , once we shape the brain in a new way , it never returns to its original shape .
i &apos;m going to play it for you in a couple minutes , but i want to make an analogy before i do to this .
because i have some limited time , i &apos;ll cut it off for a second , and tell you about how it works and what it &apos;s good for .
and hopefully they &apos;ll be sensitive that they don &apos;t want to offend you with just one more outlet .
linearity means higher quality sound .
and so , another way of hopefully determining who &apos;s friendly and who isn &apos;t .
and my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe , hopefully , make something out of themselves .
he then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately .
in a hospital , this device could be used to carry around medical equipment .
the ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design .
i &apos;m also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways .
i think this true marriage of art and information is woefully underused in adult literature , and i &apos;m mystified as to why visual wealth is not more commonly used to enhance intellectual wealth .
and i specifically wrote four pages that don &apos;t connect .
and yes , sometimes i &apos;m swayed by money .
i &apos;ve been fascinated by how nature makes materials , and there &apos;s a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job .
before that , they were all soft , fluffy structures .
and i know it says mit , and this is caltech , but i have a couple extra if people want it .
once you find that one out of a billion , you infect it into a bacteria , and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence .
in this case , you &apos;re seeing oxygen bubbles come out .
you &apos;ll find out that people don &apos;t say what businesses think they would say .
we probably went through it yesterday , or the day before , or the day before that .
that &apos;s not really what i mean .
&quot; i can &apos;t let someone work at home .
that &apos;s pretty much what managers are for . they &apos;re for interrupting people .
you don &apos;t schedule an eight-hour meeting with outlook .
giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable .
and i specialize in human behavioral research , and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways , and to design for that future .
and i &apos;m not saying this is a good thing , but this is a thing , right ?
so we forget , but we &apos;re also adaptable , and we adapt to situations around us pretty well .
and it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation .
if you go on the streets of india and china , you see this kind of stuff .
and this is from delhi .
and i think our relevance and ted &apos;s relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen , essentially .
what this is doing is , we find a -- a direct collision -- we find a direct collision between availability -- and what &apos;s possible through availability -- and a fundamental human need -- which we &apos;ve been hearing about a lot , actually -- the need to create shared narratives .
i &apos;m just the messenger .
some of you might know that , in 1990 , depp got engaged to winona ryder , and he had tattooed on his right shoulder &quot; winona forever . &quot;
and as it happens , shakespeare was onto something here , as he generally was .
now within that framework , we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things .
and for the first several hours , there was exactly one thought in my head .
that night in my apartment , after i got done kicking myself and so forth , i lay in bed for a long time , and i thought about skin grafts .
i want to suggest that there &apos;s three things that help us to make our peace with regret .
i can guess what some of you are thinking .
it is , first of all , profoundly unequal : half the world &apos;s people still living on less than two dollars a day ; a billion people with no access to clean water ; two and a half billion no access to sanitation ; a billion going to bed hungry every night ; one in four deaths every year from aids , tb , malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water -- 80 percent of them under five years of age .
there are now a couple of hundred thousand .
the only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose , treat and care for people and deliver this medicine .
will it provide high quality care ?
our business plan in rwanda was put together under the leadership of diana noble , who is an unusually gifted woman , but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work .
patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated along with four other clinics , complete with solar power generators , good lab technology .
accepting the 2007 prize , bill clinton asks for help in bringing health care to rwanda -- and the rest of the world .
and for me it &apos;s just the idea that , if this little girl graduates as a whole person , chances are she &apos;ll demand a whole world -- a whole world -- to live on .
there &apos;s nowhere to flush .
it &apos;s becoming a community .
green school is a place of pioneers , local and global .
and all the kids are thriving .
green school is a model we built for the world .
going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in 2006 , i expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show , &apos; ebert and roeper at the movies . &apos; i had pre-taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation .
then i tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice .
but i decided then to just give it a try .
it makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while i was commenting on &quot; casablanca &quot; and &quot; citizen kane . &quot;
that has mostly happened in my lifetime .
i joined compuserve when it had fewer numbers than i currently have followers on twitter .
when you see me today , i look like the phantom of the opera .
i am productive .
some people say it should be free ; it should be tabloid , or even smaller : a4 ; it should be local , run by communities , or niche , for some smaller groups like business -- but then it &apos;s not free ; it &apos;s very expensive .
i wanted to make posters , not newspapers .
did design do this ?
and you need to remember that to be good is not enough .
so bear with me as i take you through this journey .
and in fact , they started to call me a gomer .
and so the senior citizens realized that they needed to have an emergency meeting .
and a former teacher who happened to have alzheimer &apos;s took on the task of teaching me to write .
and i go , &quot; i &apos;m just going to touch it . &quot;
this is how he wrote most of his mathematics .
he wrote , &quot; the universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written .
you see it already . immediately you go in , the reflective symmetry in the water .
now , for galois , there was actually a sixth symmetry .
and there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end .
and this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects -- they both have six symmetries . so why shouldn &apos;t we say they have the same symmetries ?
now , let &apos;s move to the very different-looking wall in the alhambra .
it will make you immortal .
it actually has -- the number of symmetries in the rubik &apos;s cube has 25 digits .
what would our ancestors 10,000 years ago have said if they really had technology assessment ?
but he did his best , and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine .
and that again proves that when you &apos;re talking about unintended consequences , it &apos;s not that easy to know the right lessons to draw .
so they reformulated the bactericide .
so very often , some kind of disaster -- sometimes the consequence , for example , of over-cultivation of silk worms , which was a problem in europe at the time -- can be the key to something much bigger .
hold down the shift key to scroll back up again .
answering machine : at the tone , please — beep .
i &apos;ve just turned your $ 50 camera into a $ 1,000 camera with that trick .
okay , let &apos;s move this photo to the back , let &apos;s delete this guy here , and i think it &apos;s just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information .
changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s a good job . that &apos;s interesting .
so if you need to have some image of what &apos;s happening in the stock market right now , what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms that are basically programmed to hide , and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act .
and you see this behavior on amazon as surely as you see it on wall street .
and you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them , and they &apos;re sort of like secret architects in your bedroom .
and of course , it is , but it &apos;s distributed from places .
thank you .
js : okay . wet hands .
and remember , one towel per person for one year -- 571,230,000 pounds of paper . no small thing .
so , here &apos;s one . there &apos;s another one which i studied .
you couldn &apos;t suddenly tell everyone , &quot; ok , remember what you used to do at yield signs ? now do something different . &quot;
another statistic , perhaps my favorite , is to look at childhood deaths .
now , ironically , what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones , which is where the rich countries are .
if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way , you do it vigorously , you can actually get a local eradication .
that &apos;s part of the reason we &apos;re here today , part of the reason we &apos;re successful .
and that doesn &apos;t seem entirely fair .
once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter .
they have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools , some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching .
first of all , there &apos;s a lot more testing going on , and that &apos;s given us the picture of where we are .
you know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen .
so many artists speak about needing to be open , to embrace experience , and that &apos;s hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that takes all of your focus .
i was to the point where i was using a stopwatch and painting squares out of randomness , and i wasn &apos;t getting anywhere . so i went back and dumped all my paintings in the arno , and i thought , i &apos;m going to just start playing around .
jb : he did . he pulled in every favor he could , and got a pass into the world trade center site , where he photographed for nine months almost every day .
see , i &apos;ve asked that question all the way across the country , and everywhere i ask it , no matter where , there &apos;s always a huge portion of the audience that won &apos;t put up their hand .
he just kind of held the lollipop out like this . &quot;
we need to get over our fear of how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other &apos;s lives .
so nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
so if you &apos;ve sent three specimens , it &apos;s an hour later .
the molecule passes through and gets excreted .
and then if that node has cancer , the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection .
that &apos;s a lot of people to have a lot of problems -- and this is even in so-called nerve-sparing surgery , which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem , and they are trying to avoid the nerves .
when we put these two probes together ...
successful innovation is not a single breakthrough .
so if you look at the green data points , which is air that &apos;s outside , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a large amount of microbial diversity , or variety of microbial types .
jessica green : are we filtering the wrong microbes ?
if we could turn them off , then we could try and figure out what they &apos;re necessary for .
and their neighbors , which don &apos;t have the molecule , would not .
and then when you shine light on the entire network , just that cell type will be activated .
and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear .
let &apos;s give an example of where we think this is going to go .
it &apos;s not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored , because there &apos;s nothing for the drug to bind to .
thank you .
and one of the thoughts that i had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby , and having this event happen so close -- that my first thought , when i was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building , was that i &apos;d made a terrible miscalculation in the book that i &apos;d just written .
if they did , it probably was right there at ground zero .
and , you know , i don &apos;t want to belittle that . that , in a sense -- to reference what jeff was talking about yesterday -- that was , in a sense , the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the web : that you could put up a link , and somebody could click on it , and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go .
now what &apos;s interesting here is that this is a quote from dave weinberger , where he talks about everything being purposive in the web -- there &apos;s nothing artificial .
and it turns out , actually , that 42 percent is the mola mola fish .
so you know , you can actually download -- it &apos;s hard to remember those .
so he &apos;s working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system .
what future could the young build with so little grasp of where they &apos;ve come from and so few narratives of what &apos;s possible ?
it is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor .
how has the world changed ? how could it be different ?
agree that &quot; boyz n the hood , &quot; like tennyson , offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together .
he was texting , and he couldn &apos;t text and walk at the same time .
so here &apos;s the words : tree , highway , mirror , saturn and electrode .
gotta make sure we &apos;re getting what we &apos;re looking for .
it &apos;s a way of processing what &apos;s going on so that we can use it later .
if we &apos;re not processing life , we &apos;re not living it .
so the question is , what is the first question for designers ?
so we realized we want full diversity , even though it can be difficult to remember what de gaulle said when asked what it was like to be president of france .
on the other hand , we &apos;re working with berkshire hathaway , warren buffett and shaw carpet , the largest carpet company in the world .
and yet , noaa has now shown us , for example -- you see that little blue thing above hawaii ?
so when we see e equals mc squared come along , from a poet &apos;s perspective , we see energy as physics , chemistry as mass , and all of a sudden , you get this biology .
shoes for nike , where the uppers are polyesters , infinitely recyclable , the bottoms are biodegradable soles .
because if they toxify themselves , being the lowest-cost producer , send it to the lowest-cost distribution -- wal-mart -- and then we send them all our money , what we &apos;ll discover is that we have what , effectively , when i was a student , was called mutually assured destruction .
so this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants .
how big ? well , i can give you the numbers -- 140,000 square meters -- but that doesn &apos;t really tell you very much .
and that &apos;s not true . don &apos;t let anybody tell you that we knew this already , because we did not know this already .
so for example , they name the collection from microsoft started on september 11 , 2007 , for yahoo on the march 12 , 2008 , and then others : google , facebook , skype , apple and so on .
let &apos;s take , for example , sweden .
do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat , we are ready to do anything at all ?
we know this through examples of corrupt presidents like nixon .
and to quote a fellow security researcher , haroon meer , one country only has to make a small wave , but those small waves together become a tide , and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time , and the tide we will build with secure , free , open-source systems , will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state .
so about a hundred years ago , some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells .
we each have 23 pairs of chromosomes .
this maps the large cabling in the brain .
so the technician takes the instructions .
so the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree .
most of you are probably familiar with genome-wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying , &quot; scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect x. &quot;
and so what you &apos;re looking at here in donor one and donor four , which are the exceptions to the other two , that genes are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells .
do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money ?
we don &apos;t know .
do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage , or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them ?
so what is the problem ?
well , beforehand , everything is the same .
and many experiments have been run , and they all have the same results , so i &apos;m just going to talk to you about one .
so what &apos;s the best ?
so this is not your intuition , this is not what people would have gone for , and yet , these are the programs that work .
so we cannot eradicate poverty just yet , but we can get started .
alleviating poverty is more guesswork than science , and lack of data on aid &apos;s impact raises questions about how to provide it . but clark medal-winner esther duflo says it &apos;s possible to know which development efforts help and which hurt -- by testing solutions with randomized trials .
so let &apos;s get going because africa , to some degree , is on a turnaround .
and the siwa oasis is famous for several things , but the key thing is that it was the place that alexander the great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him .
it also is the second most populated continent , with 900 million people .
but opportunities , boy oh boy , they exist .
what &apos;s going on in nigeria ? a couple of things .
again , gathering together farmers , gathering together stakeholders in east africa to get standards for organic produce . better prices .
but in any investment decision , the key question is , &quot; what is my alternative investment ? &quot;
that is a transformation in power of ideas .
and if you compare light energy to musical scales , it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see , which is right in the middle ?
you flip a switch and there is electric light .
tom hanks : hello , houston , this is odyssey .
he remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry system , perfectly safe rocket launch , because he &apos;s sitting in a rocket that has , like , a hundred thousand pounds of thrust , built by the lowest bidder .
and when jim shot it , it was only one sub , because he was photographing from the other , and i don &apos;t remember if i did this or jim did this .
he was the master of his universe , and we wanted hugo to feel the same way , so we created this shot .
ok , now , cross your hands over , so your right hand goes over , interlace your fingers like this , then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb -- that &apos;s very important .
kb : ok , i &apos;m just going to take it off . you &apos;re ok , you &apos;re ok .
kb : just don &apos;t break my concentration .
and let &apos;s see , down at the end , here , can you also come up , real quick ?
nicole : no .
yeah , i walk around nightclubs all night like this .
can you stand up ?
good job .
think of that guy , that ba -- that guy .
actually , chris , i was going to pick you for this , but instead of picking you , can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment ?
you done ?
kb : ok , where are you ? put out your hand .
kb : good decision .
that &apos;s not good . hi . yeah . real bad . don &apos;t even look at me .
you know that when you have those abusive voices , all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic &quot; i want to kill myself &quot; kind of chemical , and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape , you might have yourself depression .
we are not equipped for the 21st century .
it was all due to this woman , sister mary marastela , also known as my mom .
in other words , i thought i could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral .
we give them lots of instruction , and we never ever deceive them .
two things .
it &apos;s empathy that makes us help other people .
&quot; well this is very valuable .
we found , testing thousands of individuals , that five percent of the population don &apos;t release oxytocin on stimulus .
so you may be wondering : these are beautiful laboratory experiments , do they really apply to real life ?
for example , through social media .
so my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname dr. love .
they must be identical to each other .
and i used to think , how on earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs ?
so i said , &quot; how on earth do you know all this ? &quot;
where does it stop ?
so i tested them .
what &apos;s learning going to be like ? we know what it &apos;s like today , children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand .
we need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure .
it &apos;s about letting it happen .
you say , &quot; there &apos;s a magic word . it &apos;s called the tangent of an angle , &quot; and leave him alone . he &apos;ll figure it out .
if you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then i &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the school of clouds , and create the future of learning .
so , i &apos;m trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked ; there are so many .
his land was no longer registered in his name .
and this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline .
instances of prominent social and political figures in polygamous relationships has led to the perception of polygamy as a symbol of wealth , status and power .
following those four children is zumra &apos;s younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well .
and finally , another individual sat for me from behind and later rescinded his participation , so i had to pixelate him out so he &apos;s unrecognizable .
children have to leave the orphanage at age 16 , despite the fact that there &apos;s often nowhere for them to go .
but anyway , it &apos;s just great to see such a full theater , and really i must thank herbie hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation .
so there , we experience the translation . now we &apos;ll experience the interpretation .
and i said , &quot; yes , i agree with that . so what &apos;s the problem ? &quot;
the interesting thing about this as well , though -- -- is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -- which is basically all of us , and we well know that music really is our daily medicine .
maybe terrible over there , but not too bad there , etc . , etc .
and please try to create that through your clapping . try . just -- please try .
experimented with my body , experimented with jewelry , experimented with all sorts of things .
so please , the next time you go to a concert , just allow your body to open up , allow your body to be this resonating chamber .
so , what &apos;s unique about the site is that it &apos;s anonymous , and it has no memory .
and / b / is known for , more than anything , not just the memes they &apos;ve created , but the exploits .
so what they did is they -- i mean , they put csi to shame here -- the internet detectives came out .
there are plenty of downsides .
now , i &apos;m not sure i would have necessarily recommended everyone at ted to go and check it out anyway .
sixty-five million years ago , a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land .
this slide was shown before . this is the famous jurassic bird archaeopteryx .
it looks rather bird-like because it is .
so , you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu .
all the stuff from jurassic park that you know of -- all those small animals -- they all come from northern continents .
i &apos;ve got it . i &apos;ve got the back legs .
an amazing record of the colonization of the sahara 5,000 years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back . so , really exciting .
i want to give you three dimensions .
this is a very extraordinarily visual .
so , we &apos;ve created an incredible track record of 100 percent graduation , 90 percent going to college , many first-generation , 90 percent of those choosing science as a career .
the gun goes off , and she &apos;s not even an underdog .
number one is , they have been living essentially unchanged for the past 400 years .
we think usain bolt is fast . usain bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel .
so why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer ?
we could run really far on a hot day .
maybe we &apos;re the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had and we spoiled it .
so what &apos;s the benefit ? so what ?
but one really struck me .
cookie monster is very , very bad .
you call your friend , she puts her handset in a robot , and , bam ! you &apos;re a mebot -- you can make eye contact , you can talk with your friends , maybe the next best thing to really being there , or is it ?
i could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays with their granddaughters , with their friends , and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house , like sharing a bedtime story .
another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface , ran exactly the same dialogues .
it turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world .
cynthia breazeal : the rise of personal robots
not one spot of dirt . the airs were brand new .
now i could have quit . i should have quit .
so what , your actors studied guerrilla theater at the london rep ?
i then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery , so i started making reference to media imagery -- made it grainy , shot through doorways and so on and so forth -- to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism .
how one moment -- it was disgusting -- journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me , saying my work was wonderful , and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me .
so , from my point of view , it &apos;s important to publish it , but at the same time it does cause a confusion -- intentional on my behalf , but problematic for any outlet that i &apos;m working with .
it was a bit of a road stopper , which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds , but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance .
thank you .
it &apos;s all about &quot; right here , right now . &quot;
and it was all very peculiar , and my headache was just getting worse . so i get off the machine , and i &apos;m walking across my living room floor , and i realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down . and every step is very rigid and very deliberate . there &apos;s no fluidity to my pace , and there &apos;s this constriction in my area of perceptions , so i &apos;m just focused on internal systems .
oh ! i felt euphoria -- euphoria . it was beautiful .
but then i would drift back out into la la land , and not remember when i came back if i &apos;d already dialed those numbers .
right here , right now , i can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere , where we are .
so we worked hard to refocus our agenda , to maximize efficient mobility , providing more room for buses , more room for bikes , more room for people to enjoy the city , and to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them .
so if it worked better for traffic , if it was better for mobility , if it was safer , better for business , we would keep it , and if it didn &apos;t work , no harm , no foul , we could put it back the way that it was , because these were temporary materials .
and we will be cutting the ribbon on this , the first phase , this december .
you can see the map in 2007 .
that &apos;s 280 times around the globe .
they &apos;re hidden in plain sight .
the best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents .
this has been -- what has been a difficult sign to some of us .
we do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals .
we also use &#91; an &#93; electronic medical record system .
and we &apos;ve hopefully saved a lot of lives .
when have you been appointed to play god ?
ok , this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters , or pick out the little letters , and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly .
they flash up into my memory , just like google for pictures .
this is tensor imaging .
because think about it : an animal is a sensory-based thinker , not verbal -- thinks in pictures , thinks in sounds , thinks in smells .
people have a hard time figuring that out .
you know , one of the things that i think maybe ted ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on ted , and there &apos;s all kinds of great stuff on the internet to get these kids turned on .
i was taught that when i was very , very young .
now , some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology , or a degree in chemistry , you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry .
if you have a two , three or four year old you know , no speech , no social interaction , i can &apos;t emphasize enough : don &apos;t wait , you need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching .
and this is before the internet got really big .
ah , sorry about that .
and the team is expert , and the team is courageous , and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery , as is true with any major expedition on the planet .
you can &apos;t see the front of your hand , and the people on the boat , bonnie and my team on the boat , they just hear the slapping of the arms , and they know where i am , because there &apos;s no visual at all .
and when you reach for the horizon , as i &apos;ve proven , you may not get there , but what a tremendous build of character and spirit that you lay down .
sixty-four , that no one at any age , any gender , could ever do , has done it , and there &apos;s no doubt in my mind that i am at the prime of my life today .
and coming home , my cofounder and i , we looked at it , and we said , there are two problems .
now i want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy who graduates from high school in kansas city , missouri .
but you send him to joplin after a tornado , and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service , now they have self-worth again .
when the telegraph came along , it was clear that it was going to globalize the news industry .
the scientific revolution wasn &apos;t created by the printing press .
but there was one programmer who decided that this wasn &apos;t the way to work .
each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they didn &apos;t know of each other &apos;s existence beforehand .
the new york senate has put up something called open legislation , also hosting it on github , again for all of the reasons of updating and fluidity .
that &apos;s now the state we &apos;re in with these collaboration tools .
i tried to come like him this morning , but as i walked out , then it was too cold , and i said , i &apos;d better put my shirt back on .
so that kind of tells you about , kind of , the fun things , you know , and the serious things that we try to do .
is that very common ?
so , this is called victoria crater , which is about a few football fields in size .
you know , one of them , one of the wheels is stuck , is not working , one of the front wheels , so what we are doing , we are driving it backwards .
so the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples that we put them in an oven and actually heat them and look what gases will come from it .
bc : in the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute , we &apos;ll decelerate from 900 miles an hour to a relatively slow 250 miles an hour .
so i thought i would go a little bit and tell you , kind of , the steps we go through .
now , in that case , because it was a very big rover , we couldn &apos;t use airbags .
first , i &apos;m going to fly you over the rings .
and the reason i showed the little arrow there , i think that should say 30 miles , we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure the material that it is made of .
and just to kind of put us in perspective , this is a picture of saturn taken with a spacecraft from behind saturn , looking towards the sun .
nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities , and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds .
and we started from our passions .
well the way i met harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary , exponentially-growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness -- from low-cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bio-informatics to the connection of the internet and social networking .
there are all other sorts of applications , merging your phone and diagnostics , for example -- measuring your blood glucose on your iphone and sending that , potentially , to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic .
and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn &apos;t have otherwise .
we can actually now visit our patients robotically -- this is the rp7 ; if i &apos;m a hematologist , visit another clinic , visit a hospital .
now we &apos;ve talked about augmenting the patient , to some degree .
but the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller .
now how about exponentially cheaper ?
this has been called by lee hood , the father of the field , p4 medicine .
we &apos;ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardiovascular disease .
the first one is dedicated to spencer , and his grandmother , who was shocked by his work .
in those days there was still countryside close to the city , farms , cornfields , cows ; even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests .
the girl , my old love , the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party , her drunkenly stumbling , falling , sprawling , skirt hiked , eyes veined red , swollen with tears , her shame , her dishonor .
this is called &quot; thirst . &quot;
weightfully upon me was the world .
i kept finding myself at her page .
okay , we &apos;re naive , we &apos;re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .
the publication of those images , as opposed to the images themselves , caused a government to change its policies .
ansel adams said , and i &apos;m going to disagree with him , &quot; you don &apos;t take a photograph , you make it . &quot;
it all started back in 2001 .
i was a failure .
at first it was pretty sensible . we flew british airways to moscow .
my record was minus 2.5 miles .
remember , 2001 , we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world .
: ninety .
the co-pilot was a lady called monica .
this , for me , is a chance to explore the limits -- really push the limits of my own potential , see how far they stretch .
arctic explorer ben saunders recounts his harrowing solo ski trek to the north pole , complete with engaging anecdotes , gorgeous photos and never-before-seen video .
and this was very surprising to me , because i &apos;ve gone through many treatments -- there were many treatments i decided not to do -- and i never got this guilt trip to this extent .
but you know , these stories , and lots of other experiments that we &apos;ve done on conflicts of interest , basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me .
in their small boats , they carried only rudimentary navigational equipment and limited supplies of food and water .
so the question is , what can the rest of us learn about fear from visionaries and young children ?
you board the plane . the plane takes off . the engine fails .
once in a while , our fears can predict the future .
read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday clairvoyance , a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there &apos;s still time to influence how that future will play out .
and that &apos;s not really the case either .
i think it &apos;s a wonderful idea : thoroughly conscious ignorance .
indeed , there are many of us who aren &apos;t so sure about the manufacturer .
sometimes we call them grant proposals .
so , for example , we could say , well what is it that the brain does ?
if there &apos;s a real rose there , those molecules will be the ones , but even if there &apos;s no rose there , you &apos;ll have the memory of a molecule .
we currently have an educational system which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing .
or , &quot; you know what , i &apos;ll look it up , i &apos;ll ask someone , i &apos;ll phone someone . i &apos;ll find out . &quot;
and actually other regimes , they told their citizens , &quot; would you like to see the situation of iraq ?
but yes , these youth who have been inspired by universal values , who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and , at the same time , realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it -- not using violence , not trying to create chaos -- these young people , they did not go home .
how did the elite deal with that -- the so-called political elite ?
i felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them , &quot; make your best not to switch off the cameras at night , because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well . &quot;
you are witnessing change in history .
this was a headline in a u.k. newspaper , the guardian , not that long ago .
we talked to 600 drug addicts in three cities in indonesia , and we said , &quot; well , do you know how you get hiv ? &quot;
for once , your incentives are aligned .
well , i &apos;m not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the catholic church , who think somehow that if you give out condoms , everyone &apos;s going to run out and have sex .
and , again , it &apos;s because of an alignment of the incentives .
that &apos;s simply not necessarily true , and i think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now .
and if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory , all would be well .
she was 105 years old when i took this picture .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie ! hey , hey , black-eyed susie !
and play a little banjo . let &apos;s do a little medley .
we were really mad at my mom . we looked out the window .
well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
it was originally made by the dopyera brothers , who later on made the dobro , which is a wood-bodied instrument with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from .
i just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues .
well , obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon .
she came home , she took that chemistry set away , and we never saw it again .
the first thing that anybody who knows science , and has been around science , is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong . there is no method .
in fact , newton and locke were friends .
this is also , if you talk to legal scholars , the foundations of new ideas in legal thought .
and slowly , that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences , the human sciences , economics , et cetera .
you see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book .
i arrived there in september 2008 , and pretty much started to work right away .
many of you will know this tedster , danny gilbert , whose book , actually , i got it through the ted book club .
i just , without a plan , i just reacted to little requests , not work requests , those i all said no to , but other little requests .
colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software , the casa da musica logo generator .
and the whole series of work came out of it .
it &apos;s a movie about happiness .
in tana toraja , the most important social moments in people &apos;s lives , the focal points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners , but funerals .
so my husband has fond memories of talking to and playing with and generally being around his deceased grandfather , and for him there is nothing unnatural about this .
but i know that my husband &apos;s family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives , when they can ritually recount his life &apos;s narrative , weaving his story into the history of their community .
and it gets worse , i crashed it into your house .
so , the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one .
i &apos;m so sorry . no , no .
when you think what &apos;s happened to financial services , and you see what &apos;s happened to the economy , you think , &quot; well , there is a man who delivers on his promises . &quot;
and being english , when i first heard that i thought , &quot; what a load of cock . &quot;
i know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the united states .
and everyone goes , &quot; great ! &quot; he leaves the country and the french and the germans go , &quot; no , no , forget about that , absolutely not . &quot; nothing happens . he goes to strasburg .
or , any south africans , we have mandela to inspire .
well that &apos;s not true , but we &apos;ll get to the goose in a minute .
first off , scientists have egos , and scientists like to name dinosaurs .
but cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do , as you can imagine , because in museums bones are precious .
in other words , people looked at them and they saw the differences .
what &apos;s interesting is the spike on the back of the dracorex was growing very fast as well .
and the little one is really spongy .
the bone histology tells us that edmontosaurus is a juvenile , or at least a sub-adult , and the other one is an adult and we have an ontogeny .
jack horner : shape-shifting dinosaurs
it &apos;s about 300 feet wide , the size of a football field , and it sits on just four very delicate columns .
and we did a lot of media work , also a lot of experimental theater projects .
and it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix .
the view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light , and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view .
we basically did a striptease , architectural striptease , where we &apos;re framing with this kind of canopy -- the underside of three levels of expansion of juilliard , about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of broadway , and then exposing , using that canopy to frame tully hall .
we very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts .
so we all get a very distorted picture of reality .
it &apos;s a very different picture .
how many people knew the founders of facebook and google before their faces were on a magazine cover ?
she was the cbs news correspondent who was brutally sexually assaulted in egypt &apos;s tahrir square right after this photo was taken .
areca palm is a plant which removes co2 and converts it into oxygen .
kamal meattle : how to grow fresh air
pm : so is this a good idea .
as you travel now all over the world , which you do frequently , how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls ?
and so we set it up , and we called ourselves the g7 .
but i think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions .
he said , &quot; bono , wouldn &apos;t that be a good use of your messianic complex ? &quot;
for kids under five , child mortality , kids under five , it &apos;s down by 2.65 million a year .
we do love a good baseline .
you can tell politicians that these cuts &#91; can cost &#93; lives .
by doing so , you will join us and countless others in what i truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken , the ever-demanding journey of equality .
that is how fundamentally we still depend on shipping .
containerization has made it very efficient .
well , if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship , and look up to the funnel , you &apos;ll see very black smoke .
i &apos;d been well treated by the crew , i &apos;d had a garrulous and entertaining captain , and i would happily have signed up for another five weeks , something that the captain also said i was crazy to think about .
so now , all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology , and it shows the power of molecular programs -- biology does .
there are other questions like this , too .
you can look in this computer-fabricated artifact , and he &apos;s got a double-stranded genome -- that &apos;s no good .
so , you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface , and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope .
so , you start with something in the computer .
it knows how big it is .
it &apos;s a molecular computer building an electronic computer .
raul midon : &quot; peace on earth &quot;
with the significance being these funds have come in as a qt capital , not as grant or as philanthropy .
even though it pricked my conscience then , i could not , or rather i did not tend to her or assist her , because i was busy building my real estate company .
i mean , give us a sense of the numbers here -- a typical bribe and a typical fee . i mean , what &apos;s in your head ?
and we met a couple years ago when we discovered that we had both given a short ted talk about the ecology of war , and we realized that we were connected by the ideas we shared before we ever met .
so we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this , and the similar talks kind of smash together , and the different ones fly apart , and what we &apos;re left with is something quite beautiful .
and so then we might say , well , gratitude , that was last year .
sg : so that &apos;s exactly right .
homework is stressful , but when you go home every day and your home is work , you don &apos;t want to pick up any assignments .
the janitor &apos;s job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital .
and they don &apos;t mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans .
but the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing : &quot; we hate to do it but we have to follow procedure . &quot;
the lemonade story is one .
some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed .
so what can we do ?
and a bonus he &apos;s discovering is he &apos;s actually going to make even more money .
one is that we are always teaching .
paying attention to what we do , to how we do it , and , perhaps most importantly , to the structure of the organizations within which we work , so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed .
you &apos;re going to give us an arm . &quot;
and i told them i &apos;d build them an arm .
he &apos;s punching our controls guy . the guy behind him is our engineer / surgeon , which is a convenient guy to have around .
i could give you fine motor control , or i could let you curl 40 pounds ; i probably can &apos;t do both .
then we went out to brooke army medical center .
i was asked to stop at texas .
those are political questions , economic questions , strategic questions .
creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
and they lived together happily ever after .
there was so many skeptics , especially the press in london , that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me .
so , i went to talk to a doctor friend , and i asked him how could i do that ?
and then there is static apnea .
i started learning about the world-record holder .
two days before my big breath hold attempt , for the record , the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath , and almost drowning , is too boring for television .
it was my ex-girlfriend . while i was breaking the record underwater for the first time , she was sifting through my blackberry , checking all my messages .
and it was right next to the sphere .
at 15 minutes i was suffering major o2 deprivation to the heart .
and that &apos;s my life . so ...
so , what &apos;s great about this is it isn &apos;t just a faster , more convenient way to get information in the real world , but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible .
mm : so , it &apos;s not magic .
i &apos;m going to try to give you a view of the world as i see it , the problems and the opportunities that we face , and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic .
it will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable , as will the increasing rise of population .
some are weather-related , human-rights related , epidemics .
we &apos;re all in this together .
but they &apos;re using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did .
and you &apos;ve heard so many inspiring stories here , and i heard so many last night that i thought i would share a little bit of mine .
today i want to talk about design , but not design as we usually think about it .
and they are now using these in certain cultures .
be easier to find us at night .
so with antithrombin in that goat -- that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that gtc genetics wants to create .
but it &apos;s the closest they can get to a landing .
this is thomas demarse at the university of florida .
for the first time in the history of this planet , we are able to directly design organisms .
and during the course of that voyage , he saw remarkable things : tremendous diversity of plants and animals , and humans .
what &apos;s significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the northern hemisphere is in these cool gray zones .
and humans dispersed -- not once , but twice .
now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences .
and he resembles , very closely , people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern africa , or southeast asia .
it was very much uncontrollable , and in a certain sense , it seemed to be the extreme of complexity , just a mess , a mess and a mess .
i said , &quot; well , just short of 1.5 . &quot;
we see mountains in the distance .
and at the end , you get things like that .
i used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature .
again , again , again .
these two curves are averages : standard &amp; amp ; poor , the blue one ; and the red one is standard &amp; amp ; poor &apos;s from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out .
it &apos;s so simple , so dry .
this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics .
and since i study human decision making , i said , i &apos;m going to run some studies to find some answers .
okay , that &apos;s cool .
so , if you think about it , in this particular puzzle task , it could happen in investing in the stock market , very volatile out there , it could be the medical situation -- the feedback here is immediate .
it has now been five years , slightly more than five years , and the good news , thank god , is that the cancer is still in remission .
african agriculture today is among , or is , the most under-capitalized in the world .
like its agriculture , africa &apos;s markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient .
not six months later , in july 2002 , ethiopia announced a major food crisis , to the same proportions as 1984 : 14 million people at risk of starvation .
well , the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market , and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done .
at the same time , what &apos;s very fundamental to this market is that -- and again , an innovation that we &apos;ve designed for our exchange -- is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country , in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done .
ethiopia &apos;s agricultural market is 30 percent higher than south africa &apos;s grain production , and , in fact , ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in africa .
some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone .
here i am -- i &apos;m the second person on the left -- with the elders in gidan-kara , a tiny village outside of sokoto .
all we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid , and then excavate the sand , and we have our architecture .
we then pull the piles up through the dune and we &apos;re able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up .
now , there are many details left to explore in this scheme -- political , practical , ethical , financial .
i needed tools that were robust , modular , highly efficient and optimized , low-cost , made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime , not designed for obsolescence .
thank you .
but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency , this is the picture that you come up with .
but then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget , and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply , which is great ; we all need water .
it &apos;s like the new sperm donor .
it was no big deal , but it was a latrine .
so when i get sad about sanitation , i think of japan , because japan 70 years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks , and now it &apos;s a nation of what are called woshurettos , washlet toilets .
the other thing it shows you is that , although there &apos;s this beautiful forest of coral , there are no fish in that picture .
cod fed most of the people of western europe .
you can see the rows in the bottom , the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn .
and another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms .
for all the denial of climate change by government leaders , the cia and the navies of norway and the u.s. and canada , whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view .
and dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they &apos;ll start to merge , and we can imagine something like the dead-zonification of the global , coastal ocean .
and even though that turned out to be nothing , nothing at all -- -- merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths ...
for how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that i had and will describe to you now ?
the street was entirely empty .
i didn &apos;t know her name , and i never will .
and so i sure am glad i did not slow down to talk to her .
some years later , i and this woman -- we &apos;ll call her &quot; catherine fletcher &quot; -- -- went traveling through the south of portugal together .
i could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991 , and the aliens had not given us that technology yet .
humorist john hodgman rambles through a new story about aliens , physics , time , space and the way all of these somehow contribute to a sweet , perfect memory of falling in love .
it &apos;s a 130-fold improvement , and that is 10 times further and faster than anything we &apos;ve ever achieved in industrial history .
a life without shame : in his day , what that meant was a linen shirt , and today , well , you still need the shirt , but you need the hybrid car , the hdtv , two holidays a year in the sun , the netbook and ipad , the list goes on -- an almost inexhaustible supply of goods , driven by this anxiety .
and politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt , to draw down our own savings even further , just so that we can get the show back on the road , so we can keep this growth-based economy going .
or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in rembrandt &apos;s lovely , lovely sketch here ?
we &apos;re just going to click on naturejobs.uk .
it &apos;s clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations .
and actually in the period through which we &apos;ve been working over the last 18 years -- partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics -- actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world .
it was about shadows .
it just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself .
we &apos;re four percent of the world &apos;s population ; we use 25 percent of the world &apos;s oil production .
when the prestige sank off the coast of spain , there were big , floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil , with the consistency , or the viscosity , of chewing gum .
well , the reason is , is because , when we &apos;re buying gas , we &apos;re very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance .
and here &apos;s one of the things that ida tarbell said -- she said , &quot; he has a thin nose like a thorn .
and we have this kind of -- as voters , we have kind of a &quot; eureka ! &quot; moment .
i was there in 2003 .
one thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater .
this is a gas receipt , hypothetically , for a year from now .
it &apos;s almost like a chip in our brain is activated , and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the term &quot; women &apos;s issues . &quot;
we &apos;ve shifted our focus in one sentence from john to mary , and you can see john is very close to the end of the sentence , well , close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain .
why do we hear over and over again about new scandals erupting in major institutions like the catholic church or the penn state football program or the boy scouts of america , on and on and on ?
it &apos;s called kill the messenger .
and i just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach , because it &apos;s a big thematic shift , although there &apos;s lots of particulars , but the heart of it is , instead of seeing men as perpetrators and women as victims , or women as perpetrators , men as victims , or any combination in there .
now , among the many great things that martin luther king said in his short life was , &quot; in the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends . &quot;
but you know what &apos;s missing ? the leadership .
domestic violence and sexual abuse are often called &quot; women &apos;s issues . &quot; but in this bold , blunt talk , jackson katz points out that these are intrinsically men &apos;s issues -- and shows how these violent behaviors are tied to definitions of manhood . a clarion call for us all -- women and men -- to call out unacceptable behavior and be leaders of change .
because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group .
many of them are too young to run for president , but by putting the issues out there , they are influencing the presidential race .
and with a population increasing as quickly as it is , and with the water supply from these glaciers -- because of climate change -- decreasing so much , i think we have a real risk of instability .
and then i said , carry on . carry on . carry on .
but i learned two very , very important lessons there on mt . everest , and i thank my team of sherpas who taught me this .
and i &apos;ve always been nervous about the term &quot; futurist , &quot; because you seem doomed to failure because you can &apos;t really predict it .
and in fact you can program the self-assembly of things , so he starts chocolate-dipping edges , changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity .
so we start with white , blue , blue , white .
and so i &apos;m thinking about , you know , what are the programs for programming the physical universe ?
this is something that my people at squid labs are working on at the moment , called &quot; electronic rope . &quot;
but it &apos;s definitely an interesting new worldview .
however , it &apos;s hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization .
so you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city .
and so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time , use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit .
do they allow for pollination , pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities ?
although we don &apos;t have statistics for warfare throughout the middle ages to modern times , we know just from conventional history -- the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence .
now , each one of them is thinking , &quot; i don &apos;t really want to kill that guy , but he &apos;s about to kill me .
.
it &apos;s not surprising , because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms .
hiv is a serious problem in the dr congo , and aid agencies have flooded the country with free and cheap condoms . but few people are using them . why ? &quot; reformed marketer &quot; amy lockwood offers a surprising answer that upends a traditional model of philanthropy .
then the developing countries applied soap and water , vaccination .
and united states only had some , one , two thousand dollars at that time .
isn &apos;t it strange to see that the united states first grew the economy , and then gradually got rich ?
probably the world will do this .
we cannot put it into two parts .
and what has happened in the world ?
and third chance for sweden , against brazil here .
this is dollar per person . this is hiv in the countries .
so to just end up , there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest , which we don &apos;t know .
and this institution will have a very crucial role , not for united states , but for the world .
generations go by , somebody says , hey , why don &apos;t we put it on a stick ?
the argument i make is basically that , well , non-zero-sum games have always been part of life .
so that is a non-zero-sum dynamic .
we will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality .
now , the good news is that the person who said it was ann coulter .
we &apos;d really better give you a longer sound bite . &quot;
and best of all , we were able , in the last 50 years , to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments .
we found that we could discover the causation of the positive states , the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness .
so i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them .
when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at 9 : 30 in the morning , time stops for him . and it stops till the closing bell .
and the third path is meaning .
when you do something philanthropic to help another person , it lasts and it lasts .
i thought , when i first became a therapist 30 years ago , that if i was good enough to make someone not depressed , not anxious , not angry , that i &apos;d make them happy .
one , because the benefits of the marshall plan have been overstated .
the challenge facing all those who are interested in africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty .
am : thank you very much . but let me tell you this .
the fact is no government in the world , with the exception of a few , like that of idi amin , can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule .
so , the most enterprising africans end up going to work for government , and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid .
one hundred thirty-four commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies , all of which have directors and the cars . and the final thing , this is addressed to mr. bono . in his work , he may help us on this .
this is a soap disco in spain , photographed by david alan harvey .
this photograph was taken by dr. euan mason in new zealand last year , and it was submitted and published in national geographic .
here &apos;s a photograph shot in moonlight , something that digital photography has made a big difference for .
what jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places .
the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest , as a reminder of home .
to her , here was this big , goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn &apos;t seem to be interested in chasing penguins .
my confession is this : i am a health psychologist , and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier .
it &apos;s called the social stress test .
now , in a typical stress response , your heart rate goes up , and your blood vessels constrict like this .
some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin to become more compassionate and caring .
okay , so the bad news first : for every major stressful life experience , like financial difficulties or family crisis , that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent .
we cannot get medicine to them reliably , they cannot get critical supplies , and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income .
and the third is the operating system that manages the whole network .
costs are coming down very rapidly .
china alone is adding a megacity the size of new york city every two years .
and what i &apos;m going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face , using some computer graphics technology we &apos;ve developed , and also some collaborators at a company called image metrics .
you can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores to the regular skin texture .
here is the specular component animating .
and for three to four years , i went to university .
with the end of the dictatorship regime of mobutu sese seko , that most of you know , life became very , very difficult .
we cut , we dry and we packed them , we mounted them on a folder .
we heard that now from the east again the war started , and it &apos;s going fast .
i hear it and what strategy they are doing , what they are planning .
this is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this .
now we are talking about reconstitution , rebuild africa .
and go -- now , i &apos;m in the netherlands to do a ph.d .
we &apos;re roughly two days from the entrance at that point .
and we &apos;ve since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this .
it &apos;s basically a nuclear-heated torpedo .
depthx is an all-seeing eyeball .
that &apos;s more than you pay for ted , if google dropped their sponsorship .
it says you &apos;re moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station .
those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who , had they been here today , would have heartily approved .
paid line standing .
in new york , in chicago , in washington , d.c. , they &apos;ve tried this , offering 50 dollars for an a , 35 dollars for a b .
and measure . and what would you measure ?
in fact , during the past three decades , when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige , our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out , empty of larger moral meaning .
and that leads to the suggestion , maybe economic growth is almost over .
now the history that we &apos;ve achieved is that we &apos;ve grown at 2.0 percent per year over the whole period , 1891 to 2007 , and remember it &apos;s been a little bit negative since 2007 .
and everybody of course knows that the federal government debt is growing as a share of gdp at a very rapid rate , and the only way that &apos;s going to stop is some combination of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements , also called transfer payments .
back in the late 19th century , the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating .
here &apos;s an early computer .
so , i also want to explain , because dave eggers said he was going to heckle me if i said anything that was a lie , or not true to universal creativity .
but actually , there was something quite real in my life that happened when i was about 14 .
and so i &apos;m going to use , as the metaphor , this association : quantum mechanics , which i really don &apos;t understand , but i &apos;m still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor .
and it &apos;s what buddhist fishermen say , because they &apos;re not supposed to kill anything .
and you are noticing it more often .
in this case , i was writing a story that included some kind of detail , period of history , a certain location .
a big thing that i also think about is accidents .
it is in the hands of readers , and they interpret it differently .
but this guy named otto rohwedder invented sliced bread , and he focused , like most inventors did , on the patent part and the making part .
i buy the stuff in the yellow box because i always have .
i mean , if all cows were purple you &apos;d get bored with those , too .
it wasn &apos;t what they expected .
this yoyo right here cost 112 dollars , but it sleeps for 12 minutes .
after you &apos;re cremated you can have yourself made into a gem .
people with 20,000-dollar stereos don &apos;t like new music .
nine months later i found myself spraying messages in tahrir square . the reason for this act was this image that i saw in my newsfeed .
thank you .
so human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days .
and all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide .
i wanted it to be more like war photography , where i was making harder-hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet .
and to make that point even more visual , i swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death , you know , animals like guitarfish , bat rays , flounder , pufferfish , that only an hour before , were on the bottom of the ocean , alive , but now being thrown back as trash .
but it &apos;s an animal that &apos;s about 98 percent in decline throughout most of its range .
i actually jumped in and photographed this , and with the fisherman &apos;s permission , i cut the turtle out , and it was able to swim free .
they were in perfect condition , very fat and healthy , robust , no entanglement scars , the way they &apos;re supposed to look .
so i think the message is clear .
and these are horrible images .
and there are all these animals , and all these people happy , and there &apos;s this economic value .
april .
that means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light , it can store more carbon in the system , it can provide more functions .
and three years later , 137 species of birds are living here .
let &apos;s look at the next year , and you can see that that trend is continuing .
if one member trespasses the agreement , and does cut down trees , the other 19 members have to decide what &apos;s going to happen to him .
eight hundred two-liter soda bottles -- oh yea .
my daughter is not a wave .
the relationship evolves over time .
and on the other hand , accordion , the friendly bus , he carries 300 people -- 275 in sweden ; 300 brazilians .
-- that &apos;s why when we &apos;re talking about sustainability , it &apos;s not enough , green buildings .
i &apos;m working in a museum and also a multi-use city , because you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day .
ok ?
it &apos;s a part of the spiritual world .
now , whenever somebody tells me that , i think , you want to see spirituality move something ?
and just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior of the molecules , so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being unconscious , depending on the behavior of the molecules .
i gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand , but how is that possible ?
now , ask yourself about computation .
so it &apos;s an obvious mistake . why did they make the mistake ?
but this is a crisis of , not natural resources -- though i believe that &apos;s true -- but a crisis of human resources .
reform is no use anymore , because that &apos;s simply improving a broken model .
but our minds are still hypnotized by them , and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them .
but , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
and he said , &quot; it was humiliating because he said it in front of the whole class and i really felt dreadful .
you know there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
and you cannot predict the outcome of human development .
in this poignant , funny follow-up to his fabled 2006 talk , sir ken robinson makes the case for a radical shift from standardized schools to personalized learning -- creating conditions where kids &apos; natural talents can flourish .
so there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the six days war , but there &apos;s only four wars that are 100 times deadlier -- like world war i .
fight back ? give in ?
and they did it in a total devotion to non-violence .
and if it grows very big it probably happens .
they are human beings just like us .
and chris hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head , pointing at the ground , and he said , &quot; kneel . &quot;
we can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known .
that &apos;s the space that i think sculpture -- which is a bit of a paradox , sculpture that is about making material propositions -- but i think that &apos;s the space that sculpture can connect us with .
this is a lead case made around the space that my body occupied , but it &apos;s now void .
there are holes at ears . there are no holes at the eyes .
that culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where i have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from georgia tech in 1956 .
paul and anne ehrlich &apos;s environmental impact equation : i is equal to p times a times t : population , affluence and technology .
we have diverted 148 million pounds -- that &apos;s 74,000 tons -- of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago .
there is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
but let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .
ray anderson : the business logic of sustainability
saddled in the performing arts as we are , by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming , locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues , where we charge exorbitant prices .
you see them on youtube , in dance competitions , film festivals and more .
and i thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon .
and on a wednesday afternoon , i was walking down the corridor of my high school kind of minding my own business . and there was this artist teaching , who made a great big old ceramic vessel , and i happened to be looking in the door of the art room -- and if you &apos;ve ever seen clay done , it &apos;s magic -- and i &apos;d never seen anything like that before in my life .
that &apos;s the building .
and we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there . &quot;
that &apos;s puff pastry day . why ?
the kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago -- he &apos;s now an instructor .
and these are examples of some of the kids &apos; work .
my only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old . &quot;
and i &apos;m very pleased to tell you that , with their permission , i have now accumulated 600 recordings of the greatest artists in the world , including joe williams , who died , but not before his last recording was done at my school .
this was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building -- and so i had another cardboard box built and i walked back out in the streets again .
thank you very much for that . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , thank you very much for that .
let &apos;s do one in l.a. &quot;
and so i &apos;ve figured out , over time , the solution to the depression : you make a friend in every town and you &apos;ll never be lonely .
until the only things that you have left are these cells here , the output cells , the ones that send the signals to the brain , but because of all that degeneration they aren &apos;t sending any signals anymore .
so i &apos;m just going to show you one bottom-line experiment that answers this , and of course i &apos;ve got a lot of other data , so if you &apos;re interested i &apos;m happy to show more . so the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment .
so they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of dna .
what you &apos;re looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium , a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean , named vibrio fischeri .
it actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device so predators can &apos;t see its shadow , calculate its trajectory , and eat it .
what i hope you can see is that the molecules are related .
once we got that far , we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language .
what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors , and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals .
one thing the world needs , one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates .
how many say the best flute players ?
he was a very good golfer , but he had a disability .
yes , all right .
the fatigue factor is an important part of golf .
but if fairness were the only thing at stake , there would have been an easy and obvious solution .
so better to shy away from , to ignore , the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life .
democracy thrives on civil debate , michael sandel says -- but we &apos;re shamefully out of practice . he leads a fun refresher , with tedsters sparring over a recent supreme court case whose outcome reveals the critical ingredient in justice .
you know , a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
a high death rate will , of course , arise from simply rejecting these therapies , in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids .
and there are really two games in town , according to most people , with regard to postponing aging .
but after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform .
but if you &apos;re only 50 , then there &apos;s a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and , you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense , in terms of your youthfulness , both physical and mental , and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes .
so , i say that we have a 50 / 50 chance of reaching this rhr milestone , robust human rejuvenation , within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation .
the engineering approach simply says , &quot; let &apos;s go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely , but repair them quite a lot , so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist , that causes it to be pathogenic . &quot;
you may have been dissatisfied with this talk , but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff .
i &apos;m going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question , which i happen to agree with , which is that , no , aging is not a product of selection , evolution ; &#91; aging &#93; is simply a product of evolutionary neglect .
but in the last couple of years we &apos;ve become infamous for a couple of things .
but in 2007 , at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures , it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market .
like ted , i believe in people .
thank you .
while most other cities were growing an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl , they instituted an urban growth boundary .
because we &apos;ve talked a long time about diet , and we know that diet impacts weight , and weight of course impacts health .
we &apos;re pretty safe here .
until some economists said , you know , is that the right way to measure co2 ?
they rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to 10 criteria that they believe add up to quality of life : health , economics , education , housing , you name it .
and the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on .
most of our countries don &apos;t even have any opinion research .
so i &apos;m afraid we &apos;ve been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate .
i &apos;m sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures .
in about two to three hours , she started to move .
resources that were transferred to them -- and were the spanish ashamed of this ? no !
and many times i get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from africans who might know .
how can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations , with the international organizations , and with our private sector .
but i &apos;m saying it &apos;s not either or .
ngozi okonjo-iweala , the former finance minister of nigeria , sums up four days of intense discussion on aid versus trade on the closing day of tedglobal 2007 , and shares a personal story explaining her own commitment to this cause .
now it &apos;s at this time that detroit begins to see a second kind of migration , a migration to the suburbs .
and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce that was still very skilled in how to make things .
i &apos;ve done most of this work at johns hopkins university , but also at the national institute of health where i was previously .
there &apos;s something called bold imaging , which is blood oxygen level dependent imaging .
and i &apos;ve listened to that solo 200 times , and i still like it .
and so now we &apos;re playing back and forth .
and then i thought -- but here &apos;s the thing .
and i think hopefully in the next 10 , 20 years you &apos;ll actually see real , meaningful studies that say science has to catch up to art , and maybe we &apos;re starting now to get there .
it &apos;s analyzing trends . it &apos;s predicting the future .
a technician will put the electrodes onto the scalp using a conductive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abrasion .
but maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds .
so i &apos;d like to show you a few examples , because there are many possible applications for this new interface .
bill gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work , so thank you .
two hundred million people a year .
and if you look through the eye , or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye , in fact , you may be able to do this directly , without drawing any blood at all , or through your nail beds .
we have every road , every village , every , almost , square inch of madagascar .
what can we do to the mosquito ?
mosquitoes actually live ... their day-to-day nutrition comes from nectar , from flowers -- in fact , in the lab , we feed ours raisins -- but the female needs the blood meal .
the energy &apos;s a little bit high here .
there &apos;s a waste of time ; there &apos;s a waste of space ; there &apos;s a waste of energy ; and there &apos;s a waste of waste .
it actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there .
it was like vegetable jerky , and killed all of them .
i have no idea how it works , but i paid a lot of money for it .
everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning , and that &apos;s been something that &apos;s been nurturing me for some time , and it &apos;s an important statement to understand .
so if i live to see 80 years of age , i &apos;m going to have a five-hour video that encapsulates 50 years of my life .
it &apos;s not always a good day , so when you have a bad one , i think it &apos;s important to remember it , just as much as it is important to remember the &#91; good &#93; days .
learning to live on their own -- and it &apos;ll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own .
so , 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel , we have a new wheel . and i will show you , in the next video -- can you start it , please ? -- that very heavy loads can be moved .
the wind may turn , but the animal will turn always its nose into the wind .
it was the first dna phage , dna virus , dna genome that was actually sequenced .
so we took the same mycoides genome that carole had initially transplanted , and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome .
and the first chromosome we built in 2008 -- the 500,000-base pair one -- we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code , but it was using just amino acid single letter translations , which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet .
reporter : could you explain , in layman &apos;s terms , how significant a breakthrough this is please ?
but the thing is , how come it &apos;s news to most people ?
the arabic has an incantatory , almost hypnotic , quality that begs to be heard rather than read , felt more than analyzed .
and that number 72 never appears .
and these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds .
there &apos;s the nest entrance , there &apos;s a pencil for scale .
and in harvester ants , i divide the tasks of the ants i see just outside the nest into these four categories : where an ant is foraging , when it &apos;s out along the foraging trail , searching for food or bringing food back .
when the foragers come in with food , they just drop it into the upper chamber , and other ants come up from below , get the food , bring it back , husk the seeds , and pile them up .
this is what it looks like about 20 minutes later .
and finally , it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not .
i expect to meet another forager every so often .
again , i don &apos;t want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork .
that we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the internet and bring it down to the physical world in this internet zero , this internet of devices .
after von neumann , we have the pentium , where the billionth transistor is as reliable as the first one .
they had no conventional technical background .
this wasn &apos;t meant to be provocative or important , but we put together these fab labs . it &apos;s about 20,000 dollars in equipment that approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it &apos;s going .
we &apos;re learning more from them than we &apos;re giving them .
but we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects .
a hundred years ago we were looking at coal , of course , and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil .
they just move back to the mid-east and those come back .
they make it very clear to you , the saudis do , they have to have 94 dollars a barrel to make their social commitments .
it would be three times what the saudis claim they have .
if we did , we could see that our own resources are easier to use than anybody can imagine .
now i do own stocks .
tbp : i don &apos;t like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program .
i got out of school in &apos; 51 .
why are all the trash trucks today in southern california on natural gas ?
in 1849 , in that gold rush , they took over $ 700 million worth of gold out of california . it was very real .
this has its parallels , too . doctors leaving their practices .
i &apos;ll just play one of these and you &apos;ll remember it .
there &apos;s a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity .
there &apos;s asbestos under that handle there .
everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines .
i took this picture just two days ago .
she -- but you know , if you really do believe that it &apos;s the very , very beginning , if you believe it &apos;s the 1908 hurley washing machine , then you &apos;re incredibly optimistic . and i do think that that &apos;s where we are .
and the basic idea of kin selection is that , if an animal feels compassion for a close relative , and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative , then , in the end , the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself .
i don &apos;t quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes , but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions , no exposure to ethical philosophy , and you &apos;ll find , if you spend time with these people , that , basically , they believe that one good turn deserves another , and that bad deeds should be punished .
so , i hope i &apos;ve got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world .
okay . so , now you &apos;re ready for the good news that i said might save the world .
the answer &apos;s complicated . it &apos;s the occasion for a whole other talk .
if you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags , it helps to understand what makes them do it .
had the children eaten boiled sweets ?
but he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
eighty-five percent is a really big number .
and his colleagues don &apos;t think of him as a crank .
it &apos;s an incubator for about a dozen projects , all having to do with continuity over the long term .
we looked at mesas in new mexico .
then there &apos;s the point of embarkation , that is , the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest .
start with borders . if you look on the left side of the cliffs here , that &apos;s national park . that &apos;s sacrosanct -- you can &apos;t do anything with that . to the right of it is national forest .
this is one of the mines . it doesn &apos;t have any beryllium in it .
that was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again , thanks to mitch kapor , we &apos;re building up there .
now , as you gain elevation your iq goes down -- but your emotional affect goes up , which is great for having a mythic experience , whether you want to or not .
and you need to know that danny &apos;s clock is to be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine , that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day , and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate .
one of the ranches is called the kirkeby ranch , and i &apos;ll take you there for a minute .
stewart brand : the long now
well , this did not make sense to me .
now , let &apos;s take a normal example .
so i said , extracellular matrix , which is this stuff called ecm , signals and actually tells the cells what to do .
we should be able to be dealing with these things at this level , and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment .
so the cell acts like an embryo . what an exciting thing .
it &apos;s been fantastic .
then you &apos;ve also lied .
chinese water army refers to thousands of people in china that are paid small amounts of money to produce content . it could be reviews . it could be propaganda . the government hires these people , companies hire them , all over the place .
all right , well , what about online dating ?
most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes . the eyes are the window to the soul .
i can look at lies that before were said and then gone .
our computer algorithm is very accurate , much more accurate than humans can be , and it &apos;s not going to be accurate all the time .
okay glass , hang out with the flying club .
they were all wearing glass , and that &apos;s how we got that footage .
yeah , i &apos;ve really enjoyed actually exploring the world more , doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video .
as a matter of fact , one of the most fun things i &apos;ve ever , ever done in my whole life , was this christmas season at the guggenheim in new york .
i want to show you -- i &apos;m also like a big -- i go to astrologers and tarot card readers often , and that &apos;s another thing that motivates me a lot .
that &apos;s the name of the show , they eat out , they -- that &apos;s on my tombstone when i die .
there i was in high school , meeting dancers and acting .
ashleigh : doing what ?
actually , i read this great quote the other day , which was , &quot; style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
chef : no , but that &apos;s all it is .
fashion designer isaac mizrahi spins through a dizzying array of inspirations -- from &apos; 50s pinups to a fleeting glimpse of a woman on the street who makes him shout &quot; stop the cab ! &quot; inside this rambling talk are real clues to living a happy , creative life .
and i was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders , and i witnessed the rise of islamist extremism as distinct from islam the faith , and the way in which it influenced my co-religionists across the world .
because the internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world .
it &apos;s comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders .
that we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that -- we associate believing in the universality of our values -- with extremists .
and this is where i believe neoconservatism had it upside-down .
but generally , the trends that start in egypt have historically spread across the mena region , the middle east and north africa region .
you can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour .
these are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up .
this is a radio he used later to call his wife that i &apos;ll tell you about .
ok , this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself .
our two strongest climbers , todd burleson and pete athans , decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going .
apparently , doug had died higher up on the mountain .
he really said that .
so you have the prefrontal cortex here , lighting up in red .
this is where people make decisions , where they develop willpower .
this was scott fischer , rob hall , andy harris , doug hansen and yasuko namba .
now in india &apos;s case i believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today .
the third big thing i believe that has changed india is our attitude towards the english language .
and therefore democracy has become embedded .
it &apos;s because gandhi believed in villages and because the british ruled from the cities , therefore nehru thought of new delhi as an un-indian city .
they have no benefits : they don &apos;t have social security ; they don &apos;t have pension ; they don &apos;t have healthcare ; none of those things .
and then again , india does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty , because it has to marry environment and development .
that is why i think all of you should be equally concerned with it as i am .
the opening one was , &quot; what the fuck do you know about the national guard ? &quot;
sp : we &apos;re here to create money .
this film was not about the internet , but it could not have been made without it .
they just removed a burnt body , or half a body from here .
when i met the guys , and 10 of them agreed to take cameras -- in total , 21 ended up filming .
they spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save iraqi lives -- the iraqis who work on the post .
they used to throw candy to the kids .
secondly , a political theorist who &apos;s going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about .
on one level nobody &apos;s questioning that democracy is the best form of government .
and you have the internet .
so as a result of it , you have this very strange situation in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters .
transparency is politics &apos; management of mistrust .
and this is goethe , who is neither bulgarian nor a political scientist , some centuries ago he said , &quot; there is a big shadow where there is much light . &quot;
so we find some investors , and they pay for a set of services , and if those services are successful , then they improve outcomes , and with those measured reductions in re-offending , government saves money , and with those savings , they can pay outcomes .
the state is not a great parent .
there is , at the moment , a stale debate going on very often : state &apos;s better , public sector &apos;s better , private sector &apos;s better , social sector &apos;s better , for a lot of these programs .
they said , &quot; no , no , it &apos;s too hot . they come out later . they &apos;re smart . &quot;
ladies and gentlemen of the middle east , here &apos;s a serious issue . when we see each other , when we say hello , how many kisses are we going to do ?
one guy wrote another guy . he said , &quot; i never knew these people laughed . &quot;
&quot; &#91; imitating arabic &#93; -- tutti frutti ! &quot;
so ladies and gentlemen , i would like to take you on a journey throughout the continents and throughout sound itself .
so we ran off to a sushi bar .
and we &apos;ve got cradle-to-cradle gold on this thing .
for me , today , on this date , it &apos;s like a second bar mitzvah experience .
basically , it &apos;s a force acting on a tissue that it transverses .
so we put the patient on the mr table .
this is the outcome from a patient perspective -- same day after the treatment .
and i would like to tell you about pj .
i don &apos;t see , without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen , it will not happen .
one is , think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery , and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society at large -- and i think also from their physicians , by the way .
but if you go to santee alley , yeah .
well , it &apos;s because it &apos;s legal for people to copy one another .
and this , actually , is good news to trendsetters ; they want trends to be set so that they can move product .
now , the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they &apos;ve learned how to copy themselves .
you cannot copyright a recipe because it &apos;s a set of instructions , it &apos;s fact , and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish .
first : is something an artistic object ?
copyright law &apos;s grip on film , music and software barely touches the fashion industry ... and fashion benefits in both innovation and sales , says johanna blakley . in her talk , she talks about what all creative industries can learn from fashion &apos;s free culture . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and it &apos;s not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail , so i was literally left to my own devices .
now this is something that i think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet .
and there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the u.k. , but if you do the math , you &apos;ll remember it &apos;s actually the yew trees that were there first , then the churches .
it &apos;s bushfelt region , which is dry and prone to a lot of fires , as so what these trees have done is , if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree , and that this is ground level , imagine that the whole thing , that whole bulk of the tree , migrated underground , and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface .
the blue flags represent things that i &apos;ve already photographed , and the reds are places that i &apos;m still trying to get to .
so let &apos;s go back , and i &apos;ll show you what you saw . there was a lot there .
so with this focus on cost-cutting , i asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
now living in europe , he can choose to go to germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system .
since then , they publish every year .
in my practice as a consultant , i meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
compare apples to apples . who &apos;s better ?
my work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational .
they had satellite phones , and they even had night vision goggles .
this is the world that we live in .
many of you will remember this super cute video from the last ted , but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute .
all of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies , and that has a radical implication for our security , because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities .
it was proceeding at moore &apos;s law pace , but then in 2008 , something changed .
policing doesn &apos;t scale globally . at least , it hasn &apos;t , and our current system of guns , border guards , big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we &apos;re moving .
this was a technology i would frequently deploy as a police officer .
these conversations really reflect what &apos;s happening at the national and international level .
and one woman stood there with this perfect carriage , her hands at her side , and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war and how extraordinary it was .
and together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums , and they &apos;re reading many ted authors and liking it .
last may i had this extraordinary 24-hour period where i saw two visions of the world living side-by-side -- one based on violence and the other on transcendence .
we can take the easier road , the more cynical road , which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was , a fear of each other , distancing and blame .
and we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone .
there are about 120 , you see them here .
it &apos;s a statue made by verrocchio , of david , for which leonardo posed as a boy of 15 .
by this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities .
the first great epoch is commonly called the &quot; critical period . &quot;
and in this epoch , which extends from late in the first year of life to death ; it &apos;s actually doing this under behavioral control .
now this is a map , down in the surface of the brain , in which , in a very elaborate experiment we &apos;ve reconstructed the responses , location by location , in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons .
or acquiring their native language abilities .
and then , by using it in a targeted approach we &apos;re going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age .
and the brain specializes for it .
and we &apos;ve accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today .
and you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which , for example , the brain is representing language again .
michael merzenich : growing evidence of brain plasticity
they are not going to touch that , because it &apos;s not your matter .
that makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect . that five days i &apos;ll never forget -- the messy days , the lousy days , that wetness .
that makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all iims .
i want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe . that &apos;s why i put all the details on public domain like an open software .
but seven years ago , i went to the arctic for the first time .
it couldn &apos;t be further from the truth for me .
what had happened is that we are made partially of water , and when water freezes it expands .
i so believe in you lewis . i &apos;ve seen the way you &apos;ve been training .
we &apos;re finally at the north pole . this is months and months and months of dreaming to get here , years of training and planning and preparation .
i remember , just a few years ago , speaking about climate change , and people heckling me in the back and saying it doesn &apos;t even exist .
oh , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this oil , 1000 meters below where you &apos;re all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world .
well , we have to take a little excursion , and we &apos;ll start in central texas .
how the molecules are put together .
one was that they be american .
i wanted to be , as i later thought of it , empathic , which is to say , to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self-revelation .
these were people through their 90s .
we know the great lines , we know the great moments , we know what we &apos;re not going to share , and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody .
and i was dying . she was absolutely not giving me a thing .
the public self , the beauty , the intellect , and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again .
dumas malone was from mississippi originally .
and she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life .
i mean , i was a beautiful baby .
so the idea here is , unlike the concept car , we want to marry something beautiful with something that actually works .
so it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution .
so these dark blue squares show you where it &apos;s effective phototherapy .
turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like .
you think it &apos;s funny .
i am going to speak about corruption , but i would like to juxtapose two different things .
no , we are talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank accounts , on the bank accounts of liechtenstein , of the president &apos;s ministers , the high officials in the para-statal sectors .
we had here in berlin , at the aspen institute on the wannsee , we had sessions with about 20 captains of industry , and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery .
we are , germany , is not ratifying .
and i have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well .
and then the second thing i do is i stand in front of that painting , and i tell myself a story about it .
first of all , i thought , i &apos;ve got to get her into the house .
this is very plain ; the only thing that isn &apos;t plain is her pearl earring .
and he didn &apos;t look at me . he was still looking at his cards , and that &apos;s one of the seductive elements of this painting is , he &apos;s so focused on what he &apos;s doing that he doesn &apos;t look at us .
and you know what it makes me think of , is it &apos;s sort of snug and puffy ; it &apos;s like a duvet spread over a bed .
i know , i could barely utter them .
then came bollywood .
here i can tell a story of africans making movies like i do , and actually i felt this was an inspiration for me .
here is that you make these films , it sells , you jump onto the location again to make another film , because if you don &apos;t make the next film , you &apos;re not going to feed .
it &apos;s not just what you see in picture .
this ain &apos;t going to be my last movie .
filmmakers , friends of mine , they look at nollywood and they say , &quot; wow , they are doing what we really want to do , and make a buck and live with this job . &quot;
fs : oh , yes . i think i mentioned briefly -- it &apos;s close to 2,000 films .
i &apos;ve always known that the age of design is upon us , almost like a rapture .
&quot; sorry , moma , video games are not art . &quot;
i think this was truly fantastic .
i mean , that interface is beautiful .
at moma , interestingly , there &apos;s a lot of violence depicted in the art part of the collection , but when i came to moma 19 years ago , and as an italian , i said , &quot; you know what , we need a beretta . &quot;
but that &apos;s what would enable us to preserve the video games for a really long time , and that &apos;s what museums do .
the controllers are , of course , part of the experience , so you cannot do away with it .
i either convince clients at the end that i solve their problems , or i really do solve their problems , because usually they seem to like it .
and the success of it threw me for a loop .
but he was right -- i couldn &apos;t do the tail .
and the next night , we had gefilte fish .
and so i did a lot of dirty things with chain link , which nobody will forgive me for .
i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture .
he would send me a fax and show me something .
it &apos;s the support labs , which , by some coincidence , required no windows .
and we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side .
i feel much more comfortable down here .
this is the bedroom .
palais des sports , the gare de lyon over here .
and it &apos;s got a fish .
i &apos;m so cunning and clever -- i made it quiet and wonderful .
actually , this is the smallest hall in size , and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies .
it &apos;s a public space , and i made it kind of a garden structure , and you can go in it .
we have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body : the brain .
age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes .
i &apos;ve chosen to show this profile view of sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward .
i learned a huge amount from henry .
they don &apos;t feel different .
now we know that he &apos;s a convicted wife-batterer , and actually he &apos;s not the good guy .
this is the bar that he set for us .
so there are going to be problems with face transplantation .
how do we really change children &apos;s relationship to food ?
one of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics .
and we spend 35,000 dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison , and school districts spend 500 dollars a year feeding a child .
you know that everybody thinks they should be eating more , and more , and more .
and that they could figure it out , that we could sell this stuff to kids .
so this is a typical menu .
we have recycling in all of our schools .
and , you know , i &apos;m not that better off now .
one gourmet coffee , one , is more -- we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools .
whereas i felt that when you design , you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you &apos;re designing in .
all problems are local . all solutions are local .
using straw bale construction , creating heat walls .
you have to know where your resource is coming from .
but what we &apos;re known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development , and we &apos;ve been involved in a lot of issues , such as the tsunami and also things like hurricane katrina .
this is a rehabbed home , done in four days .
i showed you something that took 20 years to do .
open-source architecture is the way to go .
there should be a sheet . i don &apos;t have time to read this , because i &apos;m going to be yanked off .
and he pointed up to the sky , and he said , &quot; look , do you see that ?
the very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question .
i think everybody understands what that means .
if you &apos;re going to explain this as a bag of tricks , then it &apos;s not real consciousness , whatever it is .
and the same is true of consciousness .
and i love paintings like that -- the painting is actually about as big as it is right here .
is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right , rotated ?
because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .

thanks very much for your attention .
back in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , an urban planner in london got a phone call from a colleague in moscow saying , basically , &quot; hi , this is vladimir . i &apos;d like to know , who &apos;s in charge of london &apos;s bread supply ? &quot;
the first day with the congestion charges looked like this .
and where did they go ? if we can understand this , then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this .
i met humble people .
13,000 girls studying here in the rooms underground , full of scorpions .
i was a freshman in college , and this was when we first landed on the moon .
this morning , some of the speakers named the date when they found out about their condition .
this is much sharper than an ultrasound would be .
i was slowly losing weight , but for me , that was what the doctor told me to do .
how amazing is that ?
this is regina holliday , a painter in washington d.c. , whose husband died of kidney cancer a year after my disease .
but you see , it &apos;s still generic .
and he got them chanting by the end of the talk , &quot; raw data now .
but we &apos;re also left with a concentrated salt solution , or brine .
ah , i can see half the audience agrees with me , and i have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you .
if anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in australia , you &apos;ve seen them coming out of the botanic gardens in sydney , and if you just look at their face , you can see they have much , much larger eyes and much smaller ears .
by their attraction to wind farms . again , right now bats are looking at a little bit of a problem .
if we look at that region in mammals that don &apos;t see so well , such as bats , and we find that bats that don &apos;t see so well have the purple type , we know that this is probably what &apos;s causing this disease .
think of a mouse . but bats are very different .
that &apos;s the alliance that changes the world .
so , total reversal of security policy . anything else ?
will it be taken ?
so , there &apos;s a threshold level above which you go up in the long term , and below which you go down .
i can &apos;t go through all of them , but i &apos;ll give you an example .
this is why i &apos;m on this stage , but it &apos;s alarming .
you can see it in their faces .
so we have a problem , and one of the problems is distance .
we need a universal translator .
but we don &apos;t have the words yet , so we add a third technology .
ss : so that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on in our quest for the universal translator .
i went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
there was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
there was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
and so then i went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil .
just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable .
but that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
hi . i &apos;m going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back , just the way i am -- kind of a royal wave .
but if you &apos;re still in pain in six months &apos; or six years &apos; time , it &apos;s because these circuits are producing pain that &apos;s no longer helping you .
&quot; what is worth dying for ? &quot;
and morality relates to these truths .
the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child -- this is in proverbs 13 and 20 , and i believe , 23 .
why would we think this ?
i mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
so , what would happen if i showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; string theory is bogus .
so , some combustible material there .
if you get all those parts aligned , yes i think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
so this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere .
and they are very happy with that , apparently .
that means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids .
we take them from nature , and the only thing that we do , we give them the optimal conditions , under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms , in order to proliferate , multiply and reproduce .
so safety , with respect to the application , this is the number one answer that we get from growers , why biological control .
shimon steinberg : natural pest control ... using bugs !
this is a chain gang of guys admiring the car .
they had two machine guns and a cannon , and they had 90 horsepower ricardo engines .
i was driving down 7th avenue one night at 3 a.m. , and this steam pouring out of the street , and i thought , &quot; what causes that ? &quot; and that -- who &apos;s to say ?
it &apos;s the ascent of man using an escalator , and it &apos;s in three parts .
what we found is that , with a plan and the right people , quality of life can remain high .
don &apos;t assume the natural choice is your spouse or child .
but there were also plenty of places in the world where societies have been developing for thousands of years without any sign of a major collapse , such as japan , java , tonga and tikopea . so evidently , societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas .
fourth : relations with hostiles . montanans have the same problems as do all americans , in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies , and terrorist attacks . and finally , last item on my checklist : question of how political , economic , social , cultural attitudes play into this . montanans have long-held values , which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems .
and the other generalization that i want to mention is that it &apos;s particularly hard for a society to make quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances . for example , the greenland norse , in this difficult environment , were held together for four-and-a-half centuries by their shared commitment to religion , and by their strong social cohesion . but those two things -- commitment to religion and strong social cohesion -- also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the inuit . or today -- australia .
insects are animals that walk around on six legs .
and here you see me in a small , provincial town in china , lijiang -- about two million inhabitants .
cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti .
we could do with much , much less -- and i know , i &apos;ve been a vegetarian for a long time , and you can easily do without anything .
furthermore , per kilogram of manure , you have much , much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure .
you can vary enormously .
and when she got all the ministers of agriculture of the e.u .
but first you need to know two things about me .
no reference checks . none of the usual background stuff , no .
but , at the time , in the 13th century , it was the gadget of the day .
so how would you use this device ?
so , it &apos;s about 26 degrees . you can &apos;t see it from over there .
and it would take a full university course to illustrate it .
so , it &apos;s -- i think astrolabes are just remarkable devices .
what you &apos;re doing is , when you stand up , potential energy to kinetic energy , potential energy to kinetic energy .
just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet , it &apos;s trying to walk over a changing terrain , a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes .
five years ago i actually worked at nasa jpl during the summer as a faculty fellow .
so , for prosthesis applications it &apos;s probably not too practical , because it &apos;s not affordable .
is it even possible ? what kinds of controls should we do ?
there you go . yes !
first is : where do we get inspiration ?
so , once you do this , it is amazing how the students open up .
there you go . thank you so much .
it has one in three of its children living in poverty , and it &apos;s what is referred to as a &quot; rural ghetto . &quot;
so in february of 2009 , dr. zullinger invited us , project h design -- which is a non-profit design firm that i founded -- to come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district .
and i should say that these are three things that we &apos;ve done in bertie county , but i feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the u.s. and maybe even beyond .
so the second approach is redesigning education itself .
so we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with dr. zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one-year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class .
and the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers &apos; market and it &apos;s open to the public -- that &apos;s the final exam .
we have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year .
we were once just as certain that the world was flat .
why has it accelerated lately ?
how were we to do it ?
and look at the amazing change in this one , where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature , and once more , we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying .
that is an astonishing talk , truly an astonishing talk , and i think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way .
and these two missions , as you can tell , thread together perfectly . one adds to the other ; in fact , one would be impossible without the other .
so , even from that little clip , you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible , and we have now provided treatment to over 200 children , and the story repeats itself .
here &apos;s a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago , and you see ethan myers , a graduate student from mit , running the experiment with him .
the one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information .
when we saw that , we asked : could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath , of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism ?
i won a full academic scholarship out of high school .
and i called him up and said , &quot; listen , i ran one race and i won ... &quot;
it was really , really hot .
i was the only woman who would be doing the long jump .
so , i &apos;m just , like -- they &apos;re all looking at me like &apos; which one of these is not like the other , &apos; you know ?
so , i apply this sort of philosophy now to everything i do : sitting back and realizing the progression , how far you &apos;ve come at this day to this goal , you know .
and then this is the silicon sheath i roll over , to keep it on . which , when i sweat , you know , i &apos;m pistoning out of it .
they &apos;re also silicon .
i &apos;m actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements .
okay , so that &apos;s the first rule , and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node , but if you feel ambitious , you don &apos;t have to hold back .
if you have a free thumb , wave it around , make sure it gets connected .
we had joy . you were laughing , smiling . look at your faces . this room is full of joy .
get ready to update your twitter or facebook status .
because this isn &apos;t just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we &apos;re talking about , but this is actual economic losses .
now when this law first passed , the world &apos;s hottest mp3 player could hold just 10 songs .
it &apos;s actually very popular .
in a mathematical form .
so we better be damn sure -- and by the way , they didn &apos;t even have fun doing it , most of them -- so we better be damn sure that we know why we &apos;re doing that and it has a real purpose .
are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill ?
why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway ?
i can &apos;t think of any other subject where that &apos;s recently been possible .
in the end , if we test everyone by hand in exams , it &apos;s kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters .
conrad wolfram : teaching kids real math with computers
two days later , my sight started to fail .
let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
we don &apos;t know you &apos;re there , so it &apos;s kind of nice to say &quot; hello &quot; first .
so if you design a city with the blind in mind , you &apos;ll have a rich , walkable network of sidewalks with a dense array of options and choices all available at the street level .
it was a wonderful experience .
so , i decided to dive in head first , and try to live the bible .
so -- oh , there &apos;s another shot of my beard .
but he &apos;s still an adulterer , and still quite angry .
and i will say , though , the museum is gorgeous .
thank you . bless you , bless you .
you have to pick and choose . and anyone who follows the bible is going to be picking and choosing .
it wasn &apos;t just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines .
it &apos;s not even on the same plane as what you &apos;re talking about : the pixels are up on the display .
short shadows at noon and so forth .
we can fly around them .
and bring out this graph .
so we have a large number of movies stuck inside here .
can there really be only one interface ? there can &apos;t .
and there was a lawyer in nairobi , ory okolloh -- who some of you may know from her tedtalk -- who began blogging about it on her site , kenyan pundit .
i call it cognitive surplus .
there is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work , and as anybody who &apos;s worked as an artist or a creator knows , it &apos;s a spectrum you &apos;re constantly struggling to get on top of .
boom . no ifs , ands or buts . &quot;
communal value on the networks we have is everywhere -- every time you see a large aggregate of shared , publicly available data , whether it &apos;s photos on flickr or videos on youtube or whatever .
and like all good soaps , it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
or you could play many games in one small patch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
england invented 20 overs cricket , and said , &quot; the world must play 20 overs cricket . &quot;
it was not like reengineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is .
and they &apos;ve started promoting them with huge money behind it .
they started going to the cricket to watch shah rukh khan .
auctioneer : going at 1,500,000 dollars . chennai .
and that felt good , you know ?
there are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do , and those are errors in estimating the odds that they &apos;re going to succeed , and errors in estimating the value of their own success .
now , you see a very interesting pattern here , which is first of all , two things are vastly over-estimated , namely tornadoes and fireworks .
and most people say , &quot; ok , i &apos;ll play . &quot;
when people are asked about these two different jobs : a job where you make 60k , then 50k , then 40k , a job where you &apos;re getting a salary cut each year , and one in which you &apos;re getting a salary increase , people like the second job better than the first , despite the fact they &apos;re all told they make much less money . why ?
in both cases , it was a piece of paper .
they &apos;re sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them .
you &apos;ve all had this experience .
well , by and large people are enormously impatient .
and these are subjective values , and what you can see is , our two rules are preserved .
surely the kinds of play that at least american media give to -- and forgive me , but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents .
but is there a rational fear that actually , the reason we &apos;re frightened about this is because we think that the big one is to come ?
and there &apos;s a good reason to be , because old stuff didn &apos;t eat you . right ?
i work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills -- i work on aging -- and i &apos;m interested in doing something about it , as we &apos;ll all hear tomorrow .
and these , i &apos;ll just show these without comment .
and i really struggled with this one .
and one day i woke up and i said , &quot; well , suppose that &apos;s not true ? &quot;
and as you know , you have to have a front .
but then again , it &apos;s on my list of didactic posters .
you can see this as early as even in newborn infants .
he jumps back , and he gags , and we had to do it three times , and all three times he gagged .
if you ask enough of these , you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity .
and what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative .
and we expected huge masterpieces ! &quot;
boy : so ?
fuckin &apos; wicked , man . i saw the movie . bad ! what ?
so , for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is .
this is your life . this is ... this is ... this is your life .
you know what you are ? a crocodile .
cc : mr. gelehun , i &apos;d like to remind you you &apos;re not on trial here for any crimes you committed .
and i remember i met a lot of child soldiers -- ex-combatants , as they like to be called .
mike matas : and so throughout the whole book , al gore will walk you through and explain the photos .
what is the business here ?
but that &apos;s an interesting thing for a creative person .
so where do we go now ?
fg : yeah .
i tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn &apos;t pan out .
everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment , and if you can figure out how to work off each other -- if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other &apos;s work and play off each other , you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect .
but you &apos;ve got to -- yeah , well up until then every building leaked , so this ...
since bilbao opened , which is now four , five years , both krens and i have been called with at least 100 opportunities -- china , brazil , other parts of spain -- to come in and do the bilbao effect .
are you going to talk about me or you ?
we see above-ground mines .
and they even have different colors .
because after all , we &apos;re doing above-ground mining .
we take out the things that aren &apos;t plastics , such as the metals they missed , carpeting , foam , rubber , wood , glass , paper , you name it .
and finally , i hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to : &quot; if it &apos;s broken , it &apos;s my stuff . &quot;
and i ended up in a town called frackville .
and how do i begin to have that attraction , repulsion ?
because i think everything that we &apos;re involved in -- our clothing , our cars , our roads , and everything -- are directly a result .
and this is what they were building .
the next round comes in . it &apos;s an incredible workforce that &apos;s building there . shanghai -- i &apos;m looking at the urban renewal in shanghai , and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years .
it &apos;s breathtaking , in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming .
this is a textile mill doing synthetic silk , an oil byproduct .
there &apos;s 21,000 employees . this one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long .
wish one : world-changing . i want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability .
and you think about it , you know , grade four -- my wife and i , we say age seven is the age of reason , so they &apos;re into the age of reason . and they &apos;re pre-puberty .
accepting his 2005 prize , photographer edward burtynsky makes a wish : that his images -- stunning landscapes that document humanity &apos;s impact on the world -- help persuade millions to join a global conversation on sustainability .
because we &apos;re a smart species , we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super , super complicated , sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand , even though we &apos;ve actually created them .
does she not learn from them ? and so on .
this is a and b are kind of the points where she &apos;s sort of a little bit curious about these things -- doesn &apos;t know .
and over time , they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn , you know , who sold what at what price -- you know , who was reliable , who wasn &apos;t , and so on .
so we said , this looks bad .
and now imagine that i have you make another choice but this time , it &apos;s a little bit worse .
and so this is what we did , we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time -- or guys who were risky -- they did things differently half the time .
again , same choice ; they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time , or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three .
you know , think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things , fatty things like cheesecake .
my grandfather taught me to work with wood when i was a little boy , and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something , honor that tree &apos;s life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can .
a hundred million people in the world are homeless .
we need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger , and what we &apos;ve been working on is 30-story tall buildings made of wood .
there are models for sustainable forestry that allow us to cut trees properly , and those are the only trees appropriate to use for these kinds of systems .
we &apos;re starting to push the height up of these wood buildings , and we &apos;re hoping , and i &apos;m hoping , that my hometown of vancouver actually potentially announces the world &apos;s tallest at around 20 stories in the not-so-distant future .
that is not just poetry .
not even schoolchildren are more important than cars .
we have had cities for 8,000 years , and children could walk out of home and play .
this would be , again , a very low-cost solution if implemented from the start , low cost , pleasant transit with natural sunlight .
for mom said , &quot; to be family , is to care and share and to look out for one another .
that &apos;s what the celebration is all about .
some of you may not have heard that dr. king has been assassinated .
the question was : &quot; what is the greatest commandment ? &quot;
and so i want to close with a little song .
we wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy , not after the fact , commenting on a rule after it &apos;s written , the way is typically the case , but in advance . there was no legal precedent , no cultural precedent , no technical way of doing this .
they cannot replace government .
and i want to be clear to mention that this open government revolution is not about privatizing government , because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and litigation-oriented strategies by which we make policy today .
we piloted the work in the u.s. and the u.k. and japan and australia , and now i &apos;m pleased to report that the united states patent office will be rolling out universal , complete , and total openness , so that all patent applications will now be open for citizen participation , beginning this year .
i mean , this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade .
and while art and politics are inherently and implicitly together always and all the time , there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness .
it can &apos;t go in the mall .
it &apos;s basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction .
so we strained it from the edges , and we held it by cables .
so flexible interior for discussions , just like this , but in the round -- luminous and reconfigurable .
because sometime i feel like stopping and not doing it , because i didn &apos;t know what i was putting myself into .
but my story is huge .
but i &apos;ve never seen a dead body , at least one that i &apos;ve killed .
i know it &apos;s a shame . but who is to be blamed ?
and i &apos;ve done a campaign called lose to win .
so these people , you &apos;re killing a whole generation if you just give them aid .
are you guys ready to celebrate emma ?
before i do that , though , i want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds , and then i want to tell you two lessons that i have learned over the last 20 years as a death penalty lawyer , from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way .
what has happened instead is that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison for the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole , rather than sending them to the execution chamber .
that &apos;s what we do for most problems -- in math and physics , even in social policy -- we slice them into smaller , more manageable problems .
and we could be nudging kids like will off of the path that we &apos;re on .
it was the day that he was going to be executed , and we were just talking .
now , i had heard this phrase , &quot; age of reason , &quot; before .
there &apos;s only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence : our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit , and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment , this humiliation of rejection by santa , who was jolly -- but , let &apos;s face it , he was also very judgmental .
the virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair , sort of lounging by some water , but the libra poster is just a huge scale .
now , apparently in jerusalem in 600 bc , everyone was completely bad and evil . every single one of them : man , woman , child , infant , fetus .
what is this wonderful gift god gave women , i wondered ?
well , that would have been much different , i think i would have instantly answered , &quot; yes , yes , i feel it all the time . i feel god &apos;s love when i &apos;m hurt and confused , and i feel consoled and cared for . i take shelter in god &apos;s love when i don &apos;t understand why tragedy hits , and i feel god &apos;s love when i look with gratitude at all the beauty i see . &quot;
this is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better .
we want to be healthy and live a full life .
now , there &apos;s a huge array of nations around that global average .
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .
and i put it to you , that is not business as usual .
at a business level , you might look at the well-being of your employees , which we know is really linked to creativity , which is linked to innovation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues .
keep learning .
i &apos;m a psychologist , but rest assured , i will not bring it to the scrotal .
women sit at tables and men go from table to table , and there &apos;s a clock and a bell , and at five minutes , bingo , the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow up . and this woman says , &quot; my brother &apos;s never gotten a card , and i know exactly why .
and the strangler says very matter-of-factly , &quot; oh no . if i &apos;d felt the distress , i could not have done it .
some time ago when i was working for the new york times , it was in the &apos; 80s , i did an article on what was then a new problem in new york -- it was homeless people on the streets .
you arrive in a new city , and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place .
what &apos;s more , we abstract , repeat patterns , and recognize them .
typically , you choose yourself a rapid transport route , and in your mind this route is perceived as a straight line , and like a pearl necklace , all the stations and stops are nicely and neatly aligned along the line , and only then you start to discover some local bus routes that would fill in the gaps and that allow you for those wormhole , inter-dimensional portal shortcuts .
any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again .
but nothing , nothing prepared me for what i was to hear on the first of july 2008 .
but it wasn &apos;t easy .
yes , cancer has just been one page in my life .
why did i do it ?
that has been the most exciting thing , not the technology , not the things people have done with it , but actually the community , the spirit of all these people getting together , sending the emails .
he had put it together , combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he &apos;d put it into this software , which i think his son developed , originally , and produces this wonderful presentation .
it &apos;s not just a whole lot of other plants .
it &apos;s actual useful . it &apos;s got value .
the people who are going to solve those -- the scientists -- they have half-formed ideas in their head , they try to communicate those over the web .
one last type of data i &apos;ll talk about , maybe it &apos;s the most exciting .
and i think it &apos;s an idea worth spreading .
but the key thing here is , what do you think should be in the new goals ?
and ushahidi , which means &quot; witness &quot; in swahili , which geocodes and crowdsources information in complex emergencies to help target responses .
five thousand fewer children dying every day .
i &apos;d had dinner with her about two years ago and i &apos;d -- she had this big wedding ring and i put it on my finger and i couldn &apos;t get it off .
they were trying to put our airline out of business , and they launched what &apos;s become known as the dirty tricks campaign .
really ? you should have brought a picture . that &apos;s wonderful .
and , ok , so stop there . this was -- you had some award i think ?
he gave a wonderful talk here two days ago .
so i climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried to make sure that i was making the right decision .
as somebody who &apos;s dyslexic , you also have some quite bizarre situations .
i mean , there &apos;s a lot of people in the room who are wealthy , and they &apos;ve got kids , and we &apos;ve got this dilemma about how you bring them up .
and he said he &apos;d be delighted . and i said -- and he said , &quot; would you like me to wear my dog collar ? &quot;
rb : capitalism has been proven to be a system that works .
but i think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently .
well , richard , when i was starting off in business , i knew nothing about it and i also was sort of -- i thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding .
he just started asking , &quot; where did you buy the radio ? how much is it ? &quot;
so this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because , knowingly or unknowingly , whatever we do , you know , we leave our traces here .
if we ask einstein , he would say , &quot; whether the cow crossed the road , or the road moved underneath the cow , depends on your frame of reference . &quot;
it &apos;s a full-figure cast from myself .
so this is after a few weeks , this is after a few months .
so what you see now is called &quot; shadow foreshadow . &quot;
this is called &quot; gravity . &quot;
now clearly , david livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time , but it does seem useful to ask ourselves , &quot; just how global are we ? &quot;
so clearly , apocalyptically-minded authors have overstated the case .
the perspective was , here is this poor professor .
when you ask people in france what percentage of the french population is immigrants , the answer is about 24 percent . that &apos;s their guess .
they &apos;ve all moved back to the rural area where they came from .
getting a little more technical now .
it was , for a long time , revered as the most reliable of cars , and then they had the big recall incident .
so to close , my teacher , mr. vutter , told me that physics is cool , and hopefully , i &apos;ve convinced you that physics can teach all of us , even in the world of marketing , something special .
it &apos;s made by specialized luthiers , also in europe .
and then there &apos;s this one : &quot; if there &apos;s grass on the field , play ball . &quot;
everybody knows the rules .
and also , of course , with baseball , there &apos;s , like , the specific equipment and a specific skill set .
but if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza , we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires , to make deliberate decisions about what they want , to talk about it with their partners , and to ultimately look for not some external outcome but for what feels satisfying , and we get to decide that .
as chaucer said , &quot; love is blind . &quot;
but my most important question was always the same .
and i &apos;ve also come to think that it &apos;s one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction .
the double income family was the standard .
and i think that the television is like the global campfire .
and i say , &quot; who do you think these men are sleeping with ? &quot;
in these three brain systems : lust , romantic love and attachment -- don &apos;t always go together .
i would recommend it .
i &apos;ve been carrying on here about the biology of love .
i can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as i pulled the curtain back to see her .
i actually just assmed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science .
what if obesity isn &apos;t the cause of insulin resistance at all ?
and by the way , they don &apos;t appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people .
others think it &apos;s too much dietary fat .
maybe the system , of which i was a part , was letting you down .
my great grandfather was henry ford , and on my mother &apos;s side , my great grandfather was harvey firestone .
of course , i had no intention of doing that , and i kept speaking out about the environment , and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability .
in the decades to come , 75 percent of the world &apos;s population will live in cities , and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more .
now if you look at hong kong , they have a very interesting system called octopus there .
now i know we can develop the technology that &apos;s going to make this work , but we &apos;ve got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven &apos;t even thought of yet ; our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure must support all the future options .
bill ford : a future beyond traffic gridlock
and the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day , all you do is look at the roof , and it &apos;s a really shitty experience .
so , tiny , tiny , tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact .
so , it &apos;s not a palm pilot by any stretch of the imagination , but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand .
and this is my favorite one . my mother used to say to me , &quot; just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn &apos;t mean you have to . &quot;
but a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary , and i think that &apos;s one of the things .
we &apos;ve made a donation on everybody &apos;s behalf here to kick start , no pun intended , their next project .
and i uncovered that if learning is embedded in real-world context , that if you blur the boundaries between school and life , then children go through a journey of &quot; aware , &quot; where they can see the change , &quot; enable , &quot; be changed , and then &quot; empower , &quot; lead the change .
when will you include the child in the city ?
we said , take one idea , anything that bothers you , choose one week , and change a billion lives .
for our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you , for a very good cause , the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids .
i think that -- i &apos;ve said in the past , many , many years ago , before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda , that it wasn &apos;t about fashion -- it was about survival .
and all the components are there which are now in common parlance , in our vocabulary , you know , 30-odd years later : wind energy , recycling , biomass , solar cells .
if you compared detroit with a city of a northern european example -- and munich is not a bad example of that , with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- then a city which is really only twice as dense , is only using one-tenth of the energy .
so the humanistic ideal is very , very strong in all this work , encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here , where you can see greenery , you can see sunlight , you have a connection with nature .
the library of the free university , which opened last year , is an example of that .
and that was at the time that we sought to redesign , reinvent the airport .
you can compare how that building , in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year -- at the time that we took that project , over 7,000 tons -- what it would have been with natural gas and finally , with the vegetable oil , 450 tons .
so there has been a project which rescues the dead sea by creating a pipeline , a pipe , sometimes above the surface , sometimes buried , that will redress that , and will feed from the gulf of aqaba into the dead sea .
and that &apos;s a concerted platform .
so in an indirect way , you can see the sun .
he meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around .
and by modulating the amount of blue in our environment , we can help people to relax , or to be alert , to fall asleep , or to stay awake .
and how can light help there ?
why are all these motorways permanently lit ?
we can do that in commercial spaces like this .
i had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that i found in that country , which had 60 percent landlessness but amazing creativity .
they must not remain anonymous .
is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture ?
this is what honey bee network is about .
the whole wall is her canvas . she &apos;s sitting there with a broom .
so here &apos;s a model where a two-wheeler washing machine ...
and who knows ? somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products , and she would get revenue .
innovation is the light of my wife , noor .
this innovation is from the slums of rio .
in one day , 18,000 times , she had to do this winding to generate two sarees .
that &apos;s pretty good , but why not get rid of the wires ?
we &apos;ve solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today .
or snowmobiles . you don &apos;t need the snow .
and they belong on the sidewalks , and they &apos;ll use it seriously . &quot;
and they took it to washington ; they showed them ; and they &apos;re going to be involved now , watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities , like atlanta , where we &apos;re doing trials to see if it really can , in fact , help re-energize their downtown .
it makes just enough electricity to , for instance , do this , which at night is enough electricity , in the rest of the world , as mr. holly -- dr. holly -- pointed out , can run computers and a light bulb .
the citizens didn &apos;t only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions and burning trucks used as barricades across the city , so truly like a battlefield .
using very , very conservative assumptions , this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars .
they were incredibly effective as enforcers for the gulf cartel , so much so that at some point , they decided to just take over the operations , which is why i ask you to never keep tigers as pets , because they grow up .
and the mexican borders , but now they have grown into a truly integrated multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution across the planet .
the question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn , blissful , voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young .
and at each one of these stages , can be seen as a collision -- a collision with something else -- for example , a critical price-line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world . it &apos;s an inflection point .
among the dvd &apos;s many assets is that it &apos;s very small ; you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply .
and what &apos;s interesting is if you look at the price elasticity , if you look at the correlation between these two , as the anti-retrovirals come down , the number of people you can treat goes radically up . and the clinton foundation and who believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 -- two million in sub-saharan africa .
and the same thing &apos;s happening on the carrier side .
the force of india , and then china , and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free -- is just beginning to be felt .
and the problem is that neither side is listening to the other .
and it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green .
so that in the terrorist attacks of november they were the first responder , and are now beginning to scale , because of partnership .
that these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day , provide real pathways to hope .
but i think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power .
chris kind of mentioned i started a company with my husband .
i was an english major in college . i didn &apos;t have any use for it , but i missed writing . so , i started to write a blog and i started to create things like these little stories .
you could take that money and buy your banjo .
his father was a blogger .
and we talk about the world flattens as being this panel , and i am very optimistic .
there was a joke , originally , about my graph that i left out , which is : you see all this math ? i &apos;m just happy i was able to add it up to 100 , because that &apos;s my skill set .
and that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that , and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing , and that the idea that blogging doesn &apos;t have to be scary , that we don &apos;t always have to be attack of the blogs , that we can be people who are open , and wanting to help and talk to people .
now bluefin , in general , goes to one place : japan .
we &apos;re only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot .
and that tuna thinks it &apos;s going to japan , but it &apos;s staying in place .
this tag rides on the tuna , senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish , detach , float to the surface and send back to earth-orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag , pressure data and temperature data .
and now we &apos;re showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side .
it &apos;s a several thousand-pound animal .
so what we &apos;re able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots , 4,000 deployments , a huge herculean task , 2,000 tags in an area , shown here for the first time , off the california coast , that appears to be a gathering place .
thank you .
&quot; where were you october 5th ? &quot;
you &apos;re basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death .
it wasn &apos;t that i had to , but i chose to .
this is in warsaw .
and then sometimes you get this .
so i time-stamp my life every few moments .
because it just wouldn &apos;t work if everybody was sharing everything .
i think they kind of like to look at art .
sebastian sandys has been a bed and breakfast host on airbnb since 2008 .
former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street , and wanted to check if he needed anything .
at the time , she didn &apos;t realize that she was actually hitting on a bigger idea she later called service networking .
now — -- i love that word , superrabbit .
the big challenge is figuring out what data makes sense to pull , because the future &apos;s going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation , not a single algorithm .
now thousands of programmers today are finding better jobs this way , because stack overflow and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window into how someone really behaves , and what their peers think of them .
and so what i &apos;d like to do today is change your views , change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep .
so let &apos;s move to the brain .
you essentially sleep to save calories .
so in the 1950s , good data suggests that most of us were getting around about eight hours of sleep a night .
much of the day is fueled by caffeine , and if you &apos;re a really naughty tired brain , nicotine .
stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure .
so seek out morning light .
so what &apos;s going on ?
stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable , we can certainly make them healthier , but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness .
and it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all .
it &apos;s an extraordinarily close correlation .
very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust .
this is social mobility .
and in our analysis of the american states , we find rather the same contrast .
we worry more about how we &apos;re judged and seen by others , whether we &apos;re regarded as attractive , clever , all that kind of thing .
or for instance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on .
most people think it &apos;s land mines , but it &apos;s a vehicle accident .
regardless of your income level , you want the most beautiful , the best product that there is .
it clicks .
we have fit over 5,000 amputees , and one of the big indicators we &apos;re looking at , of course , is , does it improve lives ?
contrary to what most people think , people don &apos;t pay , taxpayers don &apos;t pay , for your life when you &apos;re in prison . you &apos;ve got to pay for your own life .
but when i came out , i vowed that i was going to do whatever i could to make sure that guys like the ones i was locked up with didn &apos;t have to waste any more of their life than they already had .
and third of all , it &apos;s so sharp , it just cuts .
so i type &quot; design emotion &quot; and my website wasn &apos;t first again .
so , she &apos;d bring people into the room , and there &apos;d be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here .
we dislike bitter tastes , we dislike loud sounds , we dislike hot temperatures , cold temperatures .
this is a kohler shower , a waterfall shower , and actually , all those knobs beneath are also showerheads .
if you want a more positive model -- this is the gm car .
now , by remoteness , i mean two or three different kinds of things .
the teachers always say , well , it &apos;s fine , but it &apos;s too expensive for what it does .
and this is what we saw .
and i built a similar hole-in-the-wall .
so if they have access to the computer , they will teach themselves , including intelligence .
it was that primary education can happen on its own , or parts of it can happen on its own .
we borrowed it . video conferencing . the personal computer itself .
what a 404 page tells you is that you fell through the cracks .
so you take a look out in the real world , and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself .
and i did the tests in the royal air force to become a pilot , and sure enough , i failed .
and that was exciting -- that was fun .
and eventually , i decided to take a secondment to join the u.n. in kosovo , which was then under u.n. administration .
but , in a way , i &apos;ve got used to the sensation of it .
those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration .
there &apos;s a bit of randomness here too because , when i was beginning independent diplomat , i went to a party in the house of lords , which is a ridiculous place , but i was holding my drink like this , and i bumped into this guy who was standing behind me .
we are living in a more complicated and fragmented world .
this will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think .
carne ross : an independent diplomat
we have the capacity to laugh and cry .
and for the way in which i &apos;m going to present the data , i want to thank ted community superstar hans rosling , who you may have just seen .
you get to 1969 , and look what happens .
this is a quick chart . here &apos;s another attribute : fantasy and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday realm &quot; and &quot; makes me feel better . &quot;
at the turn of the century , the internet takes off , reality television has taken hold .
tv executive lauren zalaznick thinks deeply about pop television . sharing results of a bold study that tracks attitudes against tv ratings over five decades , she makes a case that television reflects who we truly are -- in ways we might not have expected .
if -- ouch is right ! -- if you see this , and you &apos;re a bacterium , this is like your worst nightmare .
so this stuff is not that hard , right ?
we have to change it to something much more technical . &quot;
this needs to stop , and i wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems , and i beg them , i beseech them to just stop it .
my talk today is about self-transcendence .
this is from a 16th century aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god .
we want to satisfy our individual desires .
well let me show you .
the main argument against group selection has always been that , well sure , it would be nice to have a group of cooperators , but as soon as you have a group of cooperators , they &apos;re just going to get taken over by free-riders , individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others .
it &apos;s so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens , from the defectors , the cheaters .
the staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred , or deeply interconnected .
come , have a seat in my home entertainment center .
and i found that there was an historic precedence .
this is in long island , new york .
there is something you know about me , something very personal , and there is something i know about every one of you and that &apos;s very central to your concerns .
these two things have to come together .
does that mean that we can be grateful for everything ?
it &apos;s so simple that it &apos;s actually what we were told as children when we learned to cross the street .
and what we can do is whatever life offers to you in that present moment .
the one thing all humans have in common is that each of us wants to be happy , says brother david steindl-rast , a monk and interfaith scholar . and happiness , he suggests , is born from gratitude . an inspiring lesson in slowing down , looking where you &apos;re going , and above all , being grateful .
yet it doesn &apos;t say that ; it doesn &apos;t need to say that .
so it tends to get discounted .
&quot; when new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies , anxieties of all kinds result . &quot;
they were wild-posted around new york city .
but anyway , this is one of the ads i was most pleased with , because they were all elaborately art-directed , and this one i thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer .
and people magazine , i thought , got probably the best shot .
if you ever doubt the power of graphic design , this is a very generic sign that literally says , &quot; vote for hitler . &quot; it says nothing else .
and when i was teaching , i used to always ask the students , what &apos;s the definition of a good job ?
danny hillis actually has an update on that -- he says technology is anything that doesn &apos;t quite work yet .
i can &apos;t think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism .
and the last thing , i bring back this nudibranch .
and so it would be sort of approximately up there , coming out of the animal kingdom . and if we were to do that , we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way .
it &apos;s not just that it was resurrected . it &apos;s continued all along .
and those are the things that technology brings us .
and it &apos;s actually a way of playing the game , of playing all the games .
and this has always been the case , throughout history .
now we saw an example of this in 2011 when an american rq-170 sentinel drone got a bit confused over iran due to a gps spoofing attack , but any remotely-piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack , and that means drones will have to shoulder more decision-making .
notice that certain individuals are highlighted .
each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed i.d. burned in at the factory that can be used to track its movement through public spaces .
i was in the gulf , and i was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom .
then he lifts another arm and i lift another arm .
so the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could , every day a little closer , a little closer , a little closer .
and it starts getting really nice .
and it completely threw science on its head .
it &apos;s raining like crazy here .
and fix it .
not that i &apos;m not afraid now , but i &apos;ve learned to pretend .
humor relies on the traditions of a society .
women , because we &apos;re on the ground , we know the tradition .
this is going to affect everything .
and if that is the case , how come that it &apos;s very hard to kill a city ?
very , very good for biology -- also one of the reasons for its great resilience .
there is an extraordinary regularity .
less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising .
this 15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet -- japan , chile , portugal , scotland , doesn &apos;t matter .
so the image is that we &apos;re not only on a treadmill that &apos;s going faster , but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster .
geoffrey west : the surprising math of cities and corporations
they produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates .
nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer , but they were into it . and i asked them to put their own voice over it .
go create . go figure it out .
the main point is that , if we continue to look at education as if it &apos;s about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning , empowering student voice and embracing failure , we &apos;re missing the mark .
and they published this book in 1937 , where they actually began to think about , what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs ?
and about seven years before you &apos;re about to die , there &apos;s a spike .
there &apos;s a limb prosthetic up here , similar actually one on the soldier that &apos;s come back from iraq .
and finally , we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal .
and if you took an ultrasound of that area , it would look great .
so this is a bypass operation , just like what al gore had , with a difference .
out comes the liposuction fluid , and in this case , the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons .
a number of governments , and a number of regions , have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease .
and so i thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding british accent might help things a bit .
well you know , she calls herself black -- she &apos;s really more like a caramel color if you look at her .
and you &apos;ve all made these advancements happen in such a short time -- you &apos;re all so young .
but i don &apos;t know if there &apos;s any other dominican people here , but i know that juan enriquez , he was here yesterday .
so , we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else .
and usually my work , it takes me to washington d.c .
the daughter &apos;s marriage is very special to the mom .
and i teach comparative literature at queens college .
i want to thank chris and jacqueline , and just everyone for having me here .
and when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days , ed wilson and the pictures of james nachtwey , i think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that i like to call &quot; humanity 2.0 . &quot;
and while i was there , i made friends with a fellow named pierre omidyar , who is here today . and pierre , i apologize for this . this is a photo from the old days .
and so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things .
and we had an online component of that , our community sect called participate.net .
and we have 10 films in production right now , and dozens others in development .
finished university education , got a medical degree , 1986 .
i think it &apos;s quite significant . this is where they go .
we &apos;re going to do some open-heart surgery . i was the only brit , on a team of about nine american cardiac surgeons , cardiac nurse , intensive care nurse .
i mean , what &apos;s an x-ray viewing box ? please .
usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital , you buy a different one for children , you buy a different one for transport . this one will do everything , and it will do it at half the price and doesn &apos;t need compressed air .
african people , because they will do it with a passion , i hope .
this is a tool -- this tells you i am in solidarity with people who have hiv , people who are living with hiv .
and i &apos;m very honored by the fact that michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a unaids ambassador .
this is the transformation that took place .
we have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies .
as riadh guerfali , the veteran digital activist from tunisia , remarked over this incident , &quot; before , things were simple : you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other .
so we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the internet , which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services .
at the moment , we still don &apos;t know .
obviously there were characters like this .
why ? well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing , but also , as they say in the retail trade , it &apos;s location , location , location .
the european union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world .
and if anyone is concerned about what i believe is the necessity for new legislation , regulation , effective regulation , i say , let &apos;s take a look at bernie madoff , who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail .
except , of course , it has two business risks : arrest by law enforcement , which is , frankly , the least of their worries , and competition from other groups , i.e. a bullet in the back of the head .
and these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient .
i &apos;m not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology , or behavior .
it &apos;s not a minority theory .
charles darwin must be spinning in his grave !
so back in 1982 i said , &quot; well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor . &quot;
it &apos;s the only possible explanation of why humans , if they &apos;re very unlucky , can become grossly obese , in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate , physically impossible .
well i say , &quot; why do you think it &apos;s rubbish ? &quot;
if you look back at the early years of the last century , there was a stand-off , a lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in mendel , and the believers in darwin .
and secondly , he says , &quot; you must never be afraid to rock the boat . &quot;
this is really embarrassing .
ze frank : oh . amazing .
and so , this year , chris sent us a ted conference simulator .
so really , what are we talking about here ? oh , tech joy .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m dead serious here . i &apos;m actually -- this is not a joke .
these are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job .
it is so novel to see this , that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me .
because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature : that you have influence in a large sphere , and that my preservation depends on you .
you go into these booths , you interview your grandmother or relative , you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the library of congress .
glenn lowry , the head of moma , put it best when he said , &quot; we want visitors to actually cease being visitors .
and so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world , through video , through photos , through written history , and so people &apos;s experiences on that day , which was , in fact , this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this open platform .
my business partner told me to turn on the television .
voice 5 : still today i pray and think about those who lost their lives , and those who gave their lives to help others , but i &apos;m also reminded of the fabric of this country , the love , the compassion , the strength , and i watched a nation come together in the middle of a terrible tragedy .
and much of what i do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form .
and how are they transformed by wearing it ?
and so glaciers are these magnificent beings , and there &apos;s lots of reasons to be obsessed with them , but what i &apos;m particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations .
kate hartman : the art of wearable communication
we rise to an astronomical level , around 118 percent of gdp , really unsustainable , really dangerous .
now how did we do this ? how did we go from being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years ?
they could rearrange themselves , form bipartisan committees , but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up , the force field increased , democrats and republicans were pulled apart .
it &apos;s like put out in the two oceans and it &apos;s pulling the whole country apart , pulling left and right into their own territories like the bloods and the crips .
there &apos;s no more relationship there .
most hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers .
how many of you can see all four ?
and let our first mission be to press congress to reform itself , before it &apos;s too late for our nation .
it can undergo complex reactions , some of which are happily architectural .
so , architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material .
so , this is really interesting . now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way .
the air was fetid , the room a shambles .
for example , when i &apos;m psychotic i often have the delusion that i &apos;ve killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts .
do you want to dance ? &apos; &apos; are you on drugs ? &apos; one asked . &apos; are you high ? &apos; &apos; high ? me ? no way , no drugs .
if you &apos;ve never been restrained yourself , you may have a benign image of the experience .
they &apos;d slice me up in thin slices or make me swallow hot coals .
these relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth , and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms .
what those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everybody wants : in the words of sigmund freud , &quot; to work and to love . &quot;
we &apos;ve driven from san francisco to los angeles on highway 1 .
this is happening all over the country .
some of these creeks have claims for 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream .
it &apos;s a broken system .
and they provide needed economic support for rural communities .
so this is a scientific diagram of my brain — — around the time when i was , when i started watching those tv shows .
so what does the happiest man in the world look like ?
what if compassion is also profitable ?
and expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices .
in other words , compassion is the way to grow level 5 leaders .
we even created a seven-week curriculum on emotion intelligence , which we jokingly call &quot; searching inside yourself . &quot;
and in closing , i want to end the same place i started , with happiness .
and even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; why are you here ? &quot; women would say , &quot; well i &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot;
and he said , &quot; okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . what can we do ? &quot;
we have a program called justicemakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through .
the typeface -- the typeface is helvetica ; it &apos;s its 50th anniversary this year .
i &apos;m always amazed -- three-year-olds know who richard serra is and take you to the galleries .
it was beautiful -- it was called personal skies .
this is a beautiful project by ralph borland , who &apos;s south african .
even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint , all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by ana mir in barcelona .
thank you .
and they adopted a very interesting approach to education , which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford .
disease .
and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him .
afrigator is an aggregator of african blogs that was developed in south africa .
i walked away from a job with one of the top firms in d.c. , covington and burling , six figures .
so we need new policies , we need -- where &apos;s that coming from , you know ?
a cousin of mine died of aids , left an orphan , so we said , well , what are we going to do with her ?
we just need a push .
i nearly died , was in a coma , stayed at the hospital for two years , and underwent 36 surgeries to be able to walk again .
over 60,000 people came to the start line , all wearing white t-shirts with no political slogans .
from boston to beirut , we stand as one .
i was waiting , and when he did emerge , he was ashen-faced .
in india this is called an asha worker .
one of the things which my intern here , pratesh , built is a mobile application , which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go .
maddie &apos;s using temperature to extend this phenomenon to a new scenario .
can we be the surgeons of our classrooms ?
but first , i need to talk to you about a story , which is my story , about the story of this country that you &apos;re all here in today .
we couldn &apos;t live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources .
but of course , with the use of technology .
they start eating more meat and so on and so forth .
that water will go then to the farmers , and the farmers will be able to water their plants , and they will be able then to supply society with food .
so i would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be the very bad year for bad guys , and this phenomenon is called people power .
they will say , &quot; people power will work only if there is no oil . &quot;
second , you pick the battles you can win .
what will they do ? arrest us ? we are nowhere to be seen .
are they going to become the world wave ?
and she said , &quot; i saw your talk live-streamed .
i said , &quot; if 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000 , my life is over . &quot;
so let me go on the record and say , vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation , creativity and change .
and i thought , thank god , because shame is this horrible topic , no one wants to talk about it .
and he said , &quot; i saw this need .
you never finished that mba . your wife left you .
it &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
but you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters ? &quot;
we want to be with you and across from you .
the length is one meter and six , and the weight , it is only 450 grams .
it really is a story of dr. venkataswamy .
here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence .
and if it was not for this kind of logistics and support , many people like this would probably never get services , and certainly not when they most need it .
they do one thing at a time . they do it extremely well .
so to address this , we studied uk versus aravind .
india &apos;s revolutionary aravind eye care system has given sight to millions . thulasiraj ravilla looks at the ingenious approach that drives its treatment costs down and quality up , and why its methods should trigger a re-think of all human services .
so if i download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well , they could be thin , right -- but if it has 500 pages , i want to feel that &quot; harry potter &quot; -- it &apos;s thick .
so , what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us .
it seemed to open up new perspectives , and therein lay the paradigm shift .
1968 , i put out the whole earth catalog . was &quot; mister natural &quot; for a while .
as you go around these places there &apos;s plenty of aesthetics .
the answer is , &quot; everything . &quot;
we are learning about how dense proximity can be .
where do you think the action is going to be ?
and does nuclear really compete with coal ?
and so i would like to see the gnep program , that was developed in the bush administration , go forward aggressively .
so this is very interesting diplomacy coming along .
it &apos;s still working its way up the food chain .
but climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution , but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our gdp .
the flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted , chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides .
they were just beyond our sights .
then , you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand .
think of it as the ultimate junk shot .
dh : thank you .
bf : first try ? once on purpose ?
dh : wow , you &apos;ve been working out .
now , we risked richard &apos;s life , it &apos;s only fair we risk our own lives .
bf : anything ?
bf : all right ? oh my gosh . oh .
bf : nice .
bf : from my foot , the kick up in the seven .
but babbage , babbage himself was born at the end of the 18th century , and was a fairly famous mathematician .
now , if we look at this , and we stop for a minute , and we think about chips today , we can &apos;t look inside a silicon chip . it &apos;s just so tiny .
now , imagine these soirees , all these great and good comes along .
we could go back to babbage &apos;s machine and just make it tiny . all those things are computers .
john graham-cumming : the greatest machine that never was
the thickness of the arctic decreased more than 40 percent since 1960 .
we have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities .
and i feel humbled by their strength .
for the last three years , i was shooting the earth for the movie .
the climate is changing .
in this image-filled talk , yann arthus-bertrand displays his three most recent projects on humanity and our habitat -- stunning aerial photographs in his series &quot; the earth from above , &quot; personal interviews from around the globe featured in his web project &quot; 6 billion others , &quot; and his soon-to-be-released movie , &quot; home , &quot; which documents human impact on the environment through breathtaking video .
so the price of a base , to sequence a base , has fallen 100 million times .
and then he compared those two genomes in software , and what he found , among other things , was a deletion , a 2,000-base deletion across three billion bases in a particular gene called tp53 .
his pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what &apos;s going on , but he says , &quot; let &apos;s get this kid &apos;s genome sequenced . &quot;
so what i &apos;d like you to consider is : what does it mean when these dots don &apos;t represent the individual bases of your genome , but they connect to genomes all across the planet ?
but imagine if my genome were deidentified , sitting in software , and a third cousin &apos;s genome was also sitting there , and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations .
and the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue , and kind of punch it into the hard bone , into the tuchus -- that &apos;s a technical term -- and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out , each time , with a syringe .
this was done under local anesthesia , as an outpatient .
these corals can be quite kind of mean , you see , and i have surfing scars to prove that .
in this machine , a beam of protons and anti-protons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision , producing a burst of pure energy .
these four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has .
at this point , anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero .
in order to do this , we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions .
it &apos;s a very beautiful object , and as with any unification , we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern .
one does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won &apos;t end up being true about nature .
so are you saying that we should think of the universe , at its heart -- that the smallest things that there are , are somehow an e8 object of possibility ?
that is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening .
we know now that they &apos;re capable of imitating behaviors that they see .
there isn &apos;t time to go into it , but it &apos;s including things like tree nurseries , methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded , almost desert-like land up in these mountains .
you know , the famous scientist , e. o. wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average european or american , we need three new planets .
so it wasn &apos;t surprising to me i met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope .
and woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves , in our families , in our communities , between nations , between cultures , between religions and between us and the natural world .
how many of us have children or grandchildren , nieces , nephews ?
and i hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things , especially the roots and shoots program .
and they said , &quot; absolutely not . &quot;
and so we had black and white students and others who began to attend .
well a part of it , of course , is k-12 .
every foundation makes the difference in the next level .
whether you &apos;re talking about artists producing artists or you &apos;re talking about people getting into the social sciences , whatever the discipline -- and especially in science and engineering , as in art , for example -- you need scientists to pull the students into the work .
and so we have done -- if you look at our website at the chemistry discovery center , you &apos;ll see people coming from all over the country to look at how we are redesigning courses , having an emphasis on collaboration , use of technology , using problems out of our biotech companies on our campus , and not giving students the theories , but having them struggle with those theories .
upon educating myself a little further about plastics , i actually realized this was a bad thing .
what is the reality of that ?
so we don &apos;t really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take .
so this particular choice here is a particularly good choice , given his personal criteria .
and it is .
the others were brothers , sisters .
and then she was nervous .
aicha el-wafi + phyllis rodriguez : the mothers who found forgiveness , friendship
&quot; okay , &quot; i thought , &quot; here &apos;s a first world country , let &apos;s see what they can do . &quot;
have a smell of that , mister cameraman .
it &apos;ll last for 6,000 liters .
this will process 25,000 liters of water ; that &apos;s good enough for a family of four , for three years .
mao zedong used to refer to them as the european civil wars , and it &apos;s probably a more accurate way of describing them .
now notice , i &apos;m not talking about government .
my guess is , for what it &apos;s worth , is that the united states will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years , 15 , but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered ; it has radically changed .
we had to bring , in this case , the arab league in .
and here &apos;s the third factor , which is totally different .
so here is ashdown &apos;s third law .
for us , i think , part of the equation for our survival .
the problem is , only about one out of 5,000 people in america live to be 100 .
well , the same things happen to our cells .
just look at the advertisements .
they also have a 3,000-year-old adage , which i think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented .
and this is a question . the national institute on aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians .
this is a heterogeneous community .
marge is 104 .
when they do do intentional physical activity , it &apos;s the things they enjoy . they tend to walk , the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline , and they all tend to have a garden .
diets don &apos;t work . no diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population .
so i &apos;m a social scientist by training , so why am i here today talking about smart materials ?
another example i &apos;d like to mention is hannah perner-wilson &apos;s kit-of-no-parts .
so what happens ?
occasionally we sense something wrong or too late .
so how do we get there ?
if one guy has a really great car , but they &apos;re on their phone or , you know , doing something , they &apos;re not probably in the best position to react in an emergency .
craig venter chairs that event .
we were monitoring his po2 of his blood , his heart rate , his blood pressure .
students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them , but the way they &apos;re taught is compartmentalized and it &apos;s drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident .
they cause different things to happen inside the cell .
three : i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude , not a lifestyle .
but i felt out of control of my life .
and i cried .
we decided to do something about it , but we didn &apos;t begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program .
wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women , selling things -- here &apos;s the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people , you &apos;ll find contraceptives in thailand .
in thailand , for poor people , diamonds don &apos;t make it -- so the condom is the girl &apos;s best friend .
in all this thing , from seven children to 1.5 children , population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5 .
and then aids education in all schools , starting from university .
and then it says here , with the american flag , &quot; don &apos;t leave home without it . &quot;
those are the things to be provided by the business community .
can you imagine , at every starbucks that you can also get condoms ?
that &apos;s the problem that we &apos;re trying to solve at romotive -- that i and the other 20 nerds at romotive are obsessed with solving .
and if i want to control him , i can just drive .
this allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want .
i &apos;m aware of the mystery around us , so i write about coincidences , premonitions , emotions , dreams , the power of nature , magic .
heart is what drives us and determines our fate .
no grunting , no coughing , no wheezing , no talking to yourselves , no farting .
when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter , she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go , even when they hold a gun to her head .
so here &apos;s another tale of passion , and this is a sad one .
although women do two-thirds of the world &apos;s labor , they own less than one percent of the world &apos;s assets .
they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power , in the voluminous botero style .
author and activist isabel allende discusses women , creativity , the definition of feminism -- and , of course , passion -- in this talk .
half the food produced in the usa is currently thrown away .
the answer is what i call &quot; ancient food miles . &quot;
and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside , that &apos;s where they were sold , which is why it &apos;s called poultry .
in fact , what they did to get food was they got in their cars , drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts , came back with a week &apos;s worth of shopping , and wondered what on earth to do with it .
and that is the problem with these utopian ideas , that they are utopian .
because without that , you can &apos;t have this kind of place , food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape , and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole .
because i think it &apos;s an urgent question .
&quot; and i &apos;ll pick two-thirds of 50 . that &apos;s 33 . &quot; that &apos;s a start .
there &apos;s another group of people who seem to have a firm grip on equilibrium analysis , because they &apos;re picking zero or one .
okay . get ready .
but we &apos;re interested in , can we say something about when disagreements occur versus don &apos;t occur ?
they &apos;re hairy , smelly , fast and strong .
he had a bold idea that -- what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis .
now it &apos;s four apple cubes , and their behavior again moves towards the nash equilibrium .
something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence .
in malaysia , there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people , young people , and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art .
but i &apos;d just like to quote , finish at the end with a reference to a british author , an oxford author whom i don &apos;t quote very often , c.s. lewis .
i missed the &apos; 60s . i read about them ; i understand they were pretty interesting . i missed them , but i did spend that extraordinary year in rome , and it &apos;s a place that is never far from my mind .
that seemed like a sort of a cheap shot .
they bail out as soon as they get to the top of saint ivo , that little spiral structure you see there .
and finally carletto . you see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner .
a book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information , it &apos;s a series of layers .
&quot; pigeon &apos;s progress &quot; struck me as a catchy title .
you can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way .
as we look at the drawing board , we see what he &apos;s working on is , in fact , a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken , and the red line extends through all the sights .
the first two are the macrobot and decibot .
so they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed .
so i think these projects i &apos;ve showed here are just a tiny step towards this future , if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world .
we now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet , more than the genetic information of all other forms of life combined .
and while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy , there &apos;s a very , very exciting possibility that exists : that buried in this life , in this genetic information , are signatures of as of yet unidentified life .
now the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we &apos;re at a very un-typical place , uniquely suited and so on , and the second one is saying that we &apos;re at a typical place .
so can we have the lights back on please ? thank you .
and then thirdly , less tangible , but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge , of explanations , is evidence .
if intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations , then so is almost every other environment . so is the earth . so is a polluted earth .
if you &apos;ve been punched on the nose , then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches .
what kinds of rules ?
but it is important to recognize that north korea and south korea started out with identical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regulations , but also in the deeper senses of understandings , norms , culture , values and beliefs .
in the 1950s , hong kong was a place where millions of people could go , from the mainland , to start in jobs like sewing shirts , making toys .
with that charter , people will move there .
it must have occurred to castro that he has the chance to do for cuba what deng xiaoping did for china , but he doesn &apos;t have a hong kong there on the island in cuba .
take this representation of all of the land .
so there are many other details like this .
we just got a grant from the gordon and betty moore foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year , as a side project from environmental organisms .
maybe not surprisingly , in the deep ocean , where it &apos;s mostly blue , the photoreceptors tend to see blue light .
but it turns out the environment is very critical for this , and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what &apos;s in the environment .
the key is , how do you put all of the others ?
photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen , and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process .
&quot; okay . one bite . what the hell ? &quot;
what determines any decision you make ?
so the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past-positive gives you roots . you connect your family , identity and your self .
and what we &apos;re looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now .
but my pick for the top long news story of this past year was this one : water found on the moon .
and it is a body that has long intrigued people who &apos;ve watched the planets .
we have instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere , and my camera system is one of them .
and it was a shocker , because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be .
ok , so this is our movie of the equatorial region of titan , showing these dunes . these are dunes that are 100 meters tall , separated by a few kilometers , and they go on for miles and miles and miles .
so we have , possibly , liquid water , organic materials and excess heat .
yet , most of you have probably never heard about them .
they were allowed to use any force necessary .
i believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the middle east and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today .
in 2008 , cyclone nargis devastated myanmar .
this is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet .
so epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring .
so if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements , which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back .
so if this was happening , your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint .
as it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern .
they &apos;re beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly .
in fact , they tried .
this is where gut decisions come from .
the new york times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was rooting for langley .
the next 34 percent are your early majority , your late majority and your laggards .
it &apos;s a commercial example .
in fact , some of his ideas were bad .
we follow those who lead , not for them , but for ourselves .
they said , &quot; every day we have patients that come into the clinic -- child has an ear infection , i prescribe antibiotics .
forty-five years after geiger , health leads has to reinvent the prescription for basic resources .
do you have safe housing ? &quot;
but what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously , the waiting room became the place where health leads turned your heat back on ?
mia says , &quot; when my classmates write a prescription , they think their work is done .
thank you .
piracy is a very active threat today around the world . this is in the indian ocean .
crew of four . sophisticated communications sweep .
when you can read and write in afghanistan , you will typically put a pen in your pocket .
another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief .
he &apos;s in the scots guards .
