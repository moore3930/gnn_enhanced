so i decided , i &apos;m going to start my own biennial .
and then at the other end , there &apos;s performance and short films and indoor installations like this indoor installation and this one , and outdoor installations like this one and this one .
so the next artist , this is a group of japanese artists , a collective of japanese artists -- in tokyo .
this project is called &quot; love nests . &quot;
and we got a lot of attention when we did it .
hazel clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided , &quot; you know , i would learn a lot about culture if i created a culture that doesn &apos;t exist from scratch . &quot;
next is by a lithuanian fortune teller , jurgi petrauskas .
shea hembrey : how i became 100 artists
so , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
yb : to the dismay of my mother , this is dangerous teenage fashion right there .
women , for the first time this year , became the majority of the american workforce .
and i realized that two things were different this time around .
this has been going on for 40 years now .
and those are all things that women do very well .
they are more controlled .
she &apos;s the man now . &quot;
then we have our bud light guy who &apos;s the happy couch potato .
hanna rosin : new data on the rise of women
and to start those studies about 40 years ago , i began to look at creative people -- first artists and scientists , and so forth -- trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn &apos;t expect either fame or fortune , but which made their life meaningful and worth doing .
you can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
anita roddick is another one of these ceos we interviewed .
so those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into .
so there is a catch . there is a catch .
xl : so we clipped part of this sensor , and attached that to a switch to control the cells , and we packed this switch into an engineered virus and injected that into the brain of the mice .
sr : so let &apos;s put all of this to the test now .
it stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body .
sr : so how do we do this ?
thank you . xl : thank you .
and their whole life will be spent taking pieces of many different places and putting them together into a stained glass whole .
and of course , once you have new eyes , even the old sights , even your home become something different .
this was the wrong answer .
and i thought back to that wonderful phrase i had learned as a boy from seneca , in which he says , &quot; that man is poor not who has little but who hankers after more . &quot;
sketching an interface .
but the world has changed , and it &apos;s overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world , and to understand it .
all the projections &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
here i have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children -- big families , small families .
we can have a much more just world .
my own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
and now , obviously , they have it open .
and when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
i would be willing to bet that i &apos;m the dumbest guy in the room because i couldn &apos;t get through school . i struggled with school .
right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs , you know , and the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot .
and what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re giving them ritalin and saying , &quot; don &apos;t be an entrepreneurial type .
he groomed us , the three of us , to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people .
and i said , &quot; but you &apos;ve got two cars ... &quot; -- i &apos;m nine years old .
so i would go and collect for all the papers .
so i actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown .
and then i &apos;d just deliver pop and i &apos;d just charge twice .
that was cool because then i had retail outlets .
you breed that kind of stuff . each of my kids has two piggy banks .
we have all these lessons in front of us , but we don &apos;t take those opportunities ; we teach kids to go get a tutor .
it &apos;s a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor .
and when she said it , it made me anxious .
and here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter .
and it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly .
there &apos;s been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the treatment of gay people .
testing in humans is around the corner .
when i had dinner with her a couple of years later -- one of many dinners that we had together -- she said , &quot; you know , when it first happened , i used to wish that i had never married , that i had never had children .
and there are people who think that families like mine shouldn &apos;t be allowed to exist .
and i saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities .
i never saw brian do a project like that ever again .
he told me that he &apos;d invite the test subject in , and he &apos;d say , &quot; you know , there &apos;s a snake in the next room and we &apos;re going to go in there . &quot;
he &apos;s worked for ge , and he &apos;s had a fantastic career .
and so i &apos;ve heard doug tell the story many times , of his personal transformation and the breakthrough design that happened from it , but i &apos;ve never really seen him tell the story of the little girl without a tear in his eye .
that they should achieve what bandura calls self-efficacy , that you can do what you set out to do , and that you can reach a place of creative confidence and touch the snake .
they do this using principles of physics and chemistry , but they could also be using biology .
thank you .
and in a premonition of today &apos;s world of cloud computing and softwares of service , his system was called nls for on-line system .
and i thought , well , that &apos;s got a pretentious name , especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office .
this is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web .
facebook groups were getting created . facebook applications were getting created .
and one of the great lessons that greenpeace actually learned was that it &apos;s okay to lose control .
there are 13 cards in each suit .
24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force .
first of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
these are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
think of german unification , 1990 .
now the relationship between the state and society in china is very different from that in the west .
targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
east asia : japan , korea , china , etc . -- a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
this is a railway station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
christ , the chinese even invented golf .
the future will be more unpredictable .
but the question is , &quot; who will have it ? &quot;
it &apos;s essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff , with the things in our lives .
for example , i want to use zipcar .
when you pick your aunt up at the airport , you get a sedan .
so it &apos;s like vacation rentals for cars .
that have provided the transit data , and different developers are building applications .
in closing , and as we &apos;re moving towards the end , i just also want to encourage -- and i &apos;m willing to share my failures as well , though not from the stage .
i can &apos;t do anything to save the world . &quot;
i was quite proud of that one .
are they so different ?
and those ones are actually two taxi-drivers . &quot;
i just took their pictures and pasted them .
after that day , everyone in the favela gave me the green light .
are you an ngo ? are you the media ? &quot;
okay , india .
for example , we did books -- not for sale -- that all the community would get .
you understand the full scope of the project .
so a subject you &apos;re passionate about , a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for .
i remember it clearly .
so how do we make that actually work ?
because i have to know how people react to things .
so i don &apos;t know how much this is helping me , but it &apos;s helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off .
why would you do that ?
and only a few people can do it .
and because your brain starter motor began there , now it &apos;s got to deal with it .
and you know what those products and services are , because you own some of them .
that is one big peanut . since einstein is a bird , she &apos;s very interested in things that fly .
e : beer .
what about a wolf ?
sw : good job . thank you all .
and what we found -- and we got quite a lot of things wrong and then improved them -- but we found that the young people loved it .
we feel we &apos;re on the beginning of a journey of experiment and improvement to turn the studio school idea into something which is present , not as a universal answer for every child , but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world .
and i &apos;d like to run through a few of these today .
and we need help . of course , we need help .
all the major religions give us calendars .
they don &apos;t just give us books or words about this .
and if that thing is good , there &apos;s no problem with it at all .
you can get shot by the hard-headed atheists , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
and it takes place in an area called the shephelah in what is now israel .
it &apos;s a death wish , right ? there &apos;s no way they think they can take him .
we also call him an underdog because goliath is an experienced warrior , and david is just a shepherd .
saul has the same expectation .
and then there &apos;s that strange comment he makes to david : &quot; am i a dog that you should come to me with sticks ? &quot;
he sees two sticks when david has only one .
so we &apos;ve got over 600,000 articles in english .
and the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars .
how do we manage the quality control ?
so we do have edits by anonymous users , which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about wikipedia .
is the information verifiable ? is it a hoax ? is it true ? is it what ?
i always laugh at this , because i have no idea how they &apos;re elected , actually .
then i said , &quot; well fuck it , we &apos;ll just change the rules . &quot;
and so the wiki books project is an effort to do that .
does amazon carry it ?
and as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon , it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow .
pain and more pain -- where are you going with my love ?
and the obsession can get worse when you &apos;ve been rejected .
so , what have i learned from this experiment that i would like to tell the world ?
and indeed , there are now three academic articles in which they &apos;ve looked at this attraction , which may only last for a second , but it &apos;s a definite attraction , and either this same brain region , this reward system , or the chemicals of that reward system are involved .
and i have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree you express dopamine , serotonin , estrogen and testosterone .
why do we crave love so much , even to the point that we would die for it ? to learn more about our very real , very physical need for romantic love , helen fisher and her research team took mris of people in love -- and people who had just been dumped .
now , we do know some things about how sounds are used with certain behaviors .
and one of the reasons we thought we could do this is because the dolphins were starting to show us a lot of mutual curiosity .
here they come , and then they &apos;re going to pick up the rope and drag it around as a toy .
and we &apos;re at prototype stage , but this is how we hope it will play out .
the seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 olympics .
thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention .
i started thinking about -- when i was in college , especially as a blind person , doing a research paper was a major undertaking .
there is yves rossy .
when you go out of an airplane you are almost naked .
so you have to adapt .
so that was one of those cases where you let the wings go , right ?
so plan b , always a plan b .
really , i go step by step .
and the unseen , you have to admit , doesn &apos;t come to us through the senses .
that accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth .
in fact , there are some countries in sub-saharan africa where there &apos;s one optometrist for eight million of the population .
but the cost has to be brought right down .
and they had some , in my opinion , terrible christmas music .
then i couldn &apos;t participate for a few years .
i &apos;ll ask the technicians to start the music .
why ?
the blue whale , it &apos;s a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is , this wonderful , magnificent sequoiadendron giganteum .
so during the night , they curl the leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , you have the opening of the leaves -- there is much more movement .
this is not a metaphor .
we have the animaloid -- and the normal robots inspired by animals , insectoid , so on .
she &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
and then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and i knew what i had to do .
this is the best buy in new york city .
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags .
but i think it &apos;s also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the grand central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the new york public library .
second doctor : and good , just take it nice and slow , jake .
and i was thinking , how do i introduce this ?
because democracy depends on an informed citizenship .
now , that is not intelligent design -- not from francis crick .
they &apos;d want to know how it originated , what it was for and how it perpetuates itself .
this is a fantastic achievement .
but then i read on and i read this : &quot; first , noah had never seen rain , because prior to the flood god irrigated the earth from the ground up . &quot;
and i &apos;d really like to get a response if rick is able to do it .
they &apos;re more rare than the panda bear .
this was a bear i sat with for a while on the shores .
this is a piece of multi-year ice that &apos;s 12 years old .
i dropped down in this ice hole , just through that hole that you just saw , and i looked up under the underside of the ice , and i was dizzy ; i thought i had vertigo .
the penguin doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s cute , and the leopard seal doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s kind of big and monstrous .
and i looked at goran , and i said to him , &quot; forget that . &quot;
you don &apos;t want to be too anthropomorphic , but i swear that she looked at me like , &quot; this useless predator &apos;s going to starve in my ocean . &quot;
she chased that big seal away , went and got its penguin and brought it to me .
your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids .
listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music .
if you can &apos;t do it yourself , get a professional to do it for you .
design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work .
you just looked at your clock , right ?
so if i could control how you spend your attention , if i could maybe steal your attention through a distraction .
do you have a wallet on you ? joe : i don &apos;t .
grab my wrist , but squeeze , squeeze firm .
but it &apos;s only a start . let &apos;s try it again , a little bit differently .
so , same question i asked you before , but this time you don &apos;t have to close your eyes .
here &apos;s a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream , and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together .
but this is not what &apos;s awesome .
and i &apos;ll just hook up a little ground wire to it .
i always add humans to any technical -- if you &apos;re drawing a technical diagram , put a human in it .
living in africa is to be on the edge , metaphorically , and quite literally when you think about connectivity before 2008 .
we did that with the support of different organizations like the macarthur foundation and omidyar network .
this is the reality that we deal with .
it is not without challenge .
and you got , you said , &quot; it &apos;s the same ! &quot; and you got it wrong .
i &apos;ll never get my knighthood . i &apos;ll never get my knighthood .
and he says , do you notice anything ? and the water is whooshing down this pipe .
if you haven &apos;t understood the world you &apos;re living in , it &apos;s almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you &apos;re going to deliver fits .
and yet , the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn &apos;t silent .
and even light could not escape this current .
so you can &apos;t hide anything behind a black hole .
and if you can see -- it &apos;s kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out , those are the gravitational waves .
now it &apos;s gone .
imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided .
and if they are , i can imagine them as we are , calculating , writing computer code , building instruments , trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there .
we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state .
so in a way , by studying a woman , you can read the structure and the ideology of the country .
that implies a lot of trust .
no religion can demolish that by indoctrination .
you cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole .
you have to act compassionately .
and for dollars , is their 30 million , plus the 20 million dollars from the american manufacturer .
and someone wrote just on youtube -- it was a youtube comment : &quot; first time i smiled doing a derivative . &quot;
the other thing that happened -- and even at this point , i said , &quot; okay , maybe it &apos;s a good supplement .
but it &apos;s fundamentally different than what &apos;s happening in classrooms right now .
but the general idea is that they all fit into this knowledge map .
now i come from a very data-centric reality , so we don &apos;t want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions : &quot; oh , what do you not understand ? &quot; or &quot; what do you do understand ? &quot;
now as valuable as something like this is in a district like los altos , our goal is to use technology to humanize , not just in los altos , but on a global scale , what &apos;s happening in education .
and the collaboration you &apos;re doing with los altos , how did that come about ?
is this ready for prime time ?
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work .
and she has a sense of humor .
i see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired .
on one occasion when he was walking in the streets of paris , he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding .
kermit the frog means nothing to me . &quot;
fascinatingly , in the last few years , it &apos;s been possible to do functional brain imagery , to do fmri on people as they are hallucinating .
normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception , or imagination , and one is not conscious of them .
and actually i &apos;m a little visually impaired myself .
what i proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that .
but mostly i &apos;m entranced by it .
there &apos;s a lot of animals that use this trick , for example this black dragonfish .
but when you get down to the bottom of the ocean , that &apos;s where things get really strange .
it &apos;s got a brittle star hitching a ride .
we basically have a chat room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody &apos;s talking .
there &apos;s supposed to be something else there . &quot;
one way around this is to draw pictures .
this is dna in its classic double helix form .
but in each one of your cells , each strand of dna is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long .
so this is a single chromosome .
so with a little bit of molecular eye candy , we &apos;ve got kinesins , which are the orange ones .
traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow and in so doing , inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines .
a couple of them were students in a course i was giving on evolutionary biology .
well , if that &apos;s the case , good . why hard instead of easy ?
people low on it like things that are familiar , that are safe and dependable .
sports is to war as pornography is to sex .
i &apos;ll just flip through a few other slides .
there &apos;s a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems , it really helps .
the great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve .
people here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place .
but we hold them in san francisco -- -- and in new york .
choir : i &apos;m hooked on a feelin &apos; i &apos;m high on believin &apos; that you &apos;re in love with me dd : so richard came up from houston last year to visit us in detroit here and show the wonderful sashimi tabernacle choir .
it didn &apos;t just exist .
let me say that again : playing .
so makers harvest technology from all the places around us .
and the problem i &apos;m going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy , which is , &quot; how can we know whether other people have minds ? &quot;
and this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures i showed you , or when you read romeo and juliet or when you tried to understand alan greenspan .
rs : that one is joshua &apos;s . that &apos;s right .
and we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people &apos;s thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now , not for an action prediction , but for a moral judgment .
grace goes to make the coffee and finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder , which is sugar .
it &apos;s called trans-cranial magnetic stimulation , or tms .
please tell me that you &apos;re not taking phone calls from the pentagon , say .
why does it seem to require these beings who sense things for us to operate ?
as i had no reference point for my body , i began to ask other women about their bodies -- in particular , their vaginas , because i thought vaginas were kind of important .
actually , these stories compelled me around the world , and i &apos;ve been to over 60 countries .
my body had not only become a driven machine , but it was responsible now for destroying other women &apos;s bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine .
and she died quietly in her favorite place .
what i learned is it has to do with attention and resources that everybody deserves .
now , we see this space , this three-dimensional environment , as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out , and map &apos;s directions are really just one of them .
and from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
and while i walk outside , i &apos;ll just mention that here we &apos;re using this for telepresence , but you can equally well use this on the spot , for augmented reality .
&quot; instead , let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos . &quot;
and when they finished , we asked them , &quot; do you want to build another one ? &quot; for $ 2.40 , $ 2.10 , and so on , until at some point people said , &quot; no more . it &apos;s not worth it for me . &quot;
and not only that , everybody knew that the bionicles would be destroyed quite soon .
and i stood there in front of 200 of the most depressed people i &apos;ve ever talked to .
and we had three conditions .
the good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done , scanning it and saying &quot; uh huh , &quot; that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people &apos;s motivations .
now you had to break the eggs and add them .
at the top of the sheet , we had little diagrams of how do you fold origami .
those are really tough .
and we &apos;re actually cambodians .
but she &apos;d given the boys girls &apos; names , and the girls boys &apos; names .
so this translates into ongoing violence , foreign interests , bribery , drugs , ethnic conflicts , bad health , shame , fear and cumulative traumatic experiences .
the desperate try to restore order and normality , and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence , it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt .
and they are working with me up to today .
and also -- i think -- without psycho-social therapy , and without considering this in all humanitarian projects , we cannot build-up civil societies .
and my wake-up call came when i started reading bedtime stories to my son , and i found that at the end of day , i would go into his room and i just couldn &apos;t slow down -- you know , i &apos;d be speed reading &quot; the cat in the hat . &quot;
and thankfully , the answer is yes , because what i discovered , when i began looking around , that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better , and that busier is best .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on earth , weep with envy .
another reason -- although i think , perhaps , the most powerful reason -- why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we &apos;ve erected against slowing down .
and i now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to-do list , something that i dreaded , because it was so slow and i had to get through it quickly .
so if christian played a note -- like play an f .
anyway , i just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it .
here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you .
i found that really moving .
he &apos;s an engineer .
he was simple the instrument of god &apos;s will .
there are clouds , right .
now why is that ?
the air force &apos;s 1.5 billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb , which didn &apos;t need a bombsight at all .
in fact , it was so successful that there &apos;s no way that these days you could make a book like this .
so actually , in the early days , back when it was the arpanet , there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it .
there is no plan b right now .
this is the hottest day of the year somewhere in eastern tibet , on august 1 .
although we want to avoid suffering , it seems we are running somewhat towards it .
when you are surfing on the top , you are all elated .
the experience that translates everything is within the mind .
mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors cannot happen at the same time .
all the nominal connections , in numbers and quantities , were thought -- until the last 20 years -- thought to be more or less fixed when we reached adult age .
if you see a comic movie , you go off to the left side .
and just , i leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than i could ever say .
and to understand why , we must look at how , through the ages , military technologies have maintained or destroyed world peace .
in a major article published in 1978 , professor robert jervis of columbia university in new york described a model to understand how conflicts could arise .
you see some incredible stuff .
so , yes , if you &apos;re talking about our common ancestry with apes , it &apos;s very clear , by looking at the fossil record , we started off here .
and as any genealogist will tell you -- anybody have a member of the family , or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree , trace back in time ?
and it &apos;s by looking at the pattern of genetic variation , the pattern of these markers in people all over the world , and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history , that we &apos;ve been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today .
and so when all else fails , talk about the weather .
we are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago .
you know , the study of human origins is kind of in our dna , and we want to take it to the next level .
now , this is all a nonprofit enterprise , and so the money that we raise , after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components , gets plowed back into the project .
and slightly more complex things appear .
that &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
now , the going gets tougher .
and dna , of course , is the beautiful molecule that contains that information .
dna accumulates information through random errors , some of which just happen to work .
collective learning is a very , very powerful force , and it &apos;s not clear that we humans are in charge of it .
would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number please ?
59 squared , ok , and finally ?
321 is 103,041 . 103,041 .
eight-digit capacity -- don &apos;t you hate that ?
yes , good , ok , that &apos;s one .
audience : fifth .
&apos;66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966 -- and what month ?
i &apos;ll get five digits : one , two , three , four -- oh , i did this row already . let &apos;s do the row before you , starting with you sir : one , two , three , four , five .
make sure everybody knows that i got the answer right , because this is my big finish , ok .
how many of you have iphones ?
and then they have to decide how they &apos;re going to invest in their 52 choices , and they never heard about what is a money market fund .
so this issue of present bias causes us to think about saving , but end up spending .
no , no , no , this is a real study and it &apos;s got a lot to do with behavioral economics .
mid-sized company in the midwest , blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they cannot save more right away .
less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience .
our banks began to fail .
but nonetheless , i didn &apos;t like being on the list .
we had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments for a long , long time .
we put some investments on the river that had originally been invested upon in the original maps , and now we are currently in the final stages of developing the finest venue in the world for the sports of canoe , kayak and rowing .
and we love the idea of the demographics of highly educated twentysomethings , people with choices , choosing oklahoma city in large numbers .
it &apos;s actually a great way to save you some money .
my bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers .
and i said , &quot; i think she &apos;s dancing . &quot;
and inside i &apos;ve just been listening to nusrat fateh ali khan because he &apos;s chaotic .
so that &apos;s what i do .
and then when i would run out of that story , i would imagine that woodcutter &apos;s universe is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter .
when i first went to hollywood , they said -- i used to talk about subtext , and my agent came to me , &quot; would you kindly not talk about subtext ? &quot;
so what was i doing ?
bess : yes .
so the film is operating on many many levels in that scene .
they suck up all the water , keep to themselves , and they drip feed the lower city .
so that storytelling , like all other contradictions in the universe , is looking for harmony and infinity in moral resolutions , resolving one , but letting another go , letting another go and creating a question that is really important .
and this was the idea : i &apos;m going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated concept .
the robot provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs .
imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury .
so this is a plate of nachos .
so here &apos;s the next challenge .
and i was the product of a working-class community .
but when we met , barack was a community organizer .
they allowed for no obstacles .
my husband works in this big office .
the combined coverage of russia , china and india , for example , reached just one percent .
four years ago , on the ted stage , i announced a company i was working with at the time called odeo .
one of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message .
so we &apos;re going to just type a couple of random words into twitter .
in the &apos; 90s , it was 13th , and not because standards had fallen , but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere .
we see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you &apos;re born .
you go to the next country on the list , luxembourg , and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for korea , so luxembourg spends the same per student as korea does .
pisa has transformed that debate , and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in germany .
and you know what &apos;s interesting ? you won &apos;t believe it , but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school .
you &apos;ve seen finland doing so well on pisa , but what makes finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools .
so i felt enormous pity for fide &apos;s family .
it &apos;s monday morning .
and then there &apos;s , of course , the example that we &apos;re all too aware of : financial experts getting it so wrong that we &apos;re living through the worst recession since the 1930s .
why was it that , when i had an operation , my doctor said to me , &quot; beware , ms. hertz , of hyperpyrexia , &quot; when he could have just as easily said , &quot; watch out for a high fever . &quot;
it turned out that they were aware , as no one else within the company was , of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts , nor the experts on the ground in china , were even aware of .
it &apos;s that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world .
and they were threatened by those black ships there , that had been in tokyo harbor over the last year .
united kingdom is going down .
and we came to 1978 , and mao tse tung died , and a new guy turned up from the left .
if you have a lot inequity , macro-geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with , than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living .
growth is faster , and with projection from imf you can see where you expect them to be in 2014 .
but they ain &apos;t going to pay for what others , who have more money , have largely created , and i can agree on that .
it doesn &apos;t interact at all . so how do we know it &apos;s there ?
and again , what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see .
are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye ?
and so , here &apos;s an image from the hubble space telescope .
so , in the last century , ok , people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever ; whether it would slow down , you know , will be slowing down , but continue forever ; slow down and stop , asymptotically stop ; or slow down , stop , and then reverse , so it starts to contract again .
i mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon , ok , things that i haven &apos;t even talked about , that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting , new particle .
like he said , we &apos;re three brothers from new jersey -- you know , the bluegrass capital of the world .
and hence they ended up in an orphanage .
and they are having great fun .
and many scientists believe it &apos;s the most serious issue facing mankind .
and this is a pretty well-educated audience , so i imagine you all know something about aids .
and in fact among gay men in the us we did see that kind of change in the 1980s .
and a great way to test that is to look across areas in africa and see : do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more ?
we know they had this campaign . that &apos;s how we learn about what works .
but since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really attribute that mortality to hiv .
the epidemic was introduced to the us by actually one male steward on an airline flight , who got the disease in africa and brought it back .
so you can see that both of these series -- the black line is export value , the red line is new hiv infections -- you can see they &apos;re both increasing .
he started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago , and he was officially diagnosed in 2005 .
when you care for someone with dementia , and you get training , they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar , hands-on , open-ended .
i was never as kind as my dad , and i was never as loving .
and my father used to say at that time , &quot; i &apos;m going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world . &quot;
this is something like a new definition ever given in policing in india -- the power to prevent .
obviously , it was .
that &apos;s the second landmark .
and you see , everybody &apos;s busy . there was no time to waste .
the arguments of so-called id theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again , since darwin down to the present day .
darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity .
and i &apos;m going to put together , as guest editor , a special issue on the question , &quot; did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs ? &quot;
and that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird , way-out minority .
so , we &apos;ve reached a truly remarkable situation , a grotesque mismatch between the american intelligentsia and the american electorate .
&quot; &apos; agnostic , &apos; &quot; retorted aveling , &quot; was simply &apos; atheist &apos; writ respectable , and &apos; atheist &apos; was simply &apos; agnostic &apos; writ aggressive . &quot;
it lacks the strong connotation that there &apos;s definitely no god , and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics .
richard dawkins urges all atheists to openly state their position -- and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science . a fiery , funny , powerful talk .
but then i started feeling bad .
that &apos;s using a technology called ocr , for optical character recognition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there .
so funny things can happen .
it &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
so i don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the web who are bilingual enough to help us translate .
and they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
so it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
this is the africa of opportunity .
that &apos;s the image : african countries . but let me say this : if alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in london -- if the other people who had taken money , estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries &apos; monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they &apos;re able to do this , what is that ? is that not corruption ?
can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003 , when i left washington to go and take up the post of finance minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history ?
and we could hardly even pay anything , any salaries , in the economy .
and i can go on . dollars , on and on , into the system .
i have a cd here . i &apos;m sorry that i didn &apos;t say anything on time .
zipcar buys cars and parks them throughout dense metropolitan areas for people to use , by the hour and by the day , instead of owning their own cars .
and not just easy things that anyone can do .
they need a low deductible , and 24-hour roadside assistance .
type of thing that &apos;s happening here , because individuals , if you &apos;re a company , what happens is you might have 10 people who are in charge of innovation , or 100 people who are in charge of innovation .
yes , it &apos;s better to make more money rather than less , or to graduate from college instead of dropping out , but the differences in happiness tend to be small .
so how could this be happening ? i think part of the reason , a big part of the reason , is that when our minds wander , we often think about unpleasant things , and they are enormously less happy when they do that , our worries , our anxieties , our regrets , and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral , they &apos;re still considerably less happy than when they &apos;re not mind-wandering at all .
what we have now is the end of the rise of the west . that &apos;s over .
ghana felt safe to me as a child .
we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets .
it meant a connection to the world .
but when you do read the links , it &apos;s really quite remarkable .
you know we all want to be someone who has watched &quot; rashomon , &quot; but right now we want to watch &quot; ace ventura &quot; for the fourth time .
and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
we went in and sat down at the booth , and the waitress came over , made a big commotion over tipper .
it &apos;s like beachcombing , you know ? every time the tide comes in and out , you find some more shells .
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
it &apos;s now repetition of short , hot-button , 30-second , 28-second television ads .
taylor wilson believes nuclear fusion is a solution to our future energy needs , and that kids can change the world . and he knows something about both of those : when he was 14 , he built a working fusion reactor in his parents &apos; garage . now 17 , he takes the stage at short notice to tell his story .
its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons .
bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain .
but seriously , what &apos;s wrong with this ?
and yet , i persist in this quixotic endeavor .
what &apos;s in this picture ?
but it won &apos;t be easy , because they &apos;re not going to look like this .
i propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain .
i love things that are alive .
and as i pause for a few seconds , have a look at the screen .
so we have to think differently if we &apos;re going to make stuff come alive .
the rna people would talk about the rna world .
we can do it microfluidically , we can do it lithographically , we can do it in a 3d printer , we can do it in droplets for colleagues .
and all i wanted to show you is we can set up molecules in membranes , in real cells , and then it sets up a kind of molecular darwinism , a molecular survival of the fittest .
evolution cannot be cut apart .
that would be a big story .
and if you can , just scribble a pattern .
and that &apos;s no different from imperial college in london , by the way , it &apos;s not some sort of anti-american thing going on .
that &apos;s pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper . right ?
same for gravity , two concepts , so it &apos;s -- which is quite humbling , as a , you know , if you &apos;re a teacher , and you look before and after , that &apos;s quite worrying . they do worse in tests afterwards , after the teaching .
but then i hear people saying , &quot; there is no progress in africa .
so this is a limitation .
i would say , at least do this -- 10 years is enough to follow the trend .
whereas now , second gear -- it &apos;s like africa had first gear , now they go into second gear .
it &apos;s very strange . it &apos;s sort of embarrassing .
and they got safer water , they eradicated malaria .
it got down there -- china comes into the western box here .
we have to have a modern concept , which fits to the data .
if you have money , of course , you can get the value .
well they didn &apos;t build that . they built a proper car . nano .
and the crux of the matter was , however , getting more from less .
and of course , these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads .
let &apos;s move to health .
these targets have been achieved in india .
because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day .
the 21st century gift , which is very , very important for the whole world , whether it is global economic meltdown , whether it is climate change -- any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more -- not only the current generations , for the future generations .
what does that focal length do ?
where do you go to find out how to make an app ?
but this is actually a talk about , okay -- — but this is actually a talk about fission .
what are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons ?
and this is really important , because the reaction stops .
they &apos;re giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky .
this is the second shift : open aid .
today , i &apos;m inspired by these changes , and i &apos;m excited that at the world bank , we are embracing these new directions , a significant departure from my work in uganda 20 years ago .
if we take the toothbrush -- i don &apos;t think about the toothbrush .
can you imagine ? it &apos;s very symbolic .
if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go , &quot; i see you , oh my god you are here , how are you , i can help you , i can design for you a new toothbrush , new toilet brush , &quot; something like that .
it &apos;s very , very , very important .
but i know that even i do it the best possible -- that &apos;s why i &apos;m the best -- it &apos;s nothing .
what i want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what &apos;s scheduled .
&quot; huh ! &quot;
we &apos;re always talking about , &quot; let &apos;s fix the schools .
it &apos;s predictable .
give him to the army . we &apos;ll never see him again . we &apos;ll never see him again . &quot;
and it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people , and i &apos;m sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren , it &apos;s not enough . you &apos;ve got to reach out and back and find kids like mr. cruz who can make it if you give them the structure , if you reach back and help , if you mentor , if you invest in boys and girls clubs , if you work with your school system , make sure it &apos;s the best school system , and not just your kid &apos;s school , but the school uptown in harlem , not just downtown montessori on the west side .
and the scene repeats itself so often .
and like this magnificent origami , cells are developing at one million cells per second at four weeks , as it &apos;s just folding on itself .
and of course , when you &apos;re a little kid , there &apos;s always destruction .
and i started to make him walk across the table , and i thought , &quot; oh , i can make a little machine that will do that . &quot;
so , this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil .
it would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner .
hey . i wanna start today -- talk about the structure of a polypeptide .
i swear to god . i mean , when you look at the box , and you sort of see how it works .
which is good , but now i can &apos;t move .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re all familiar with those people who tell you what you can &apos;t do and what you should change .
there &apos;s a fundamental question -- in tv , the first act is called the teaser .
well , it &apos;s not . &quot; e.t. &quot; is about divorce . &quot; e.t. &quot; is about a heartbroken , divorce-crippled family , and ultimately , this kid who can &apos;t find his way .
the moment the lights go down is often the best part , you know ?
when i did &quot; mission : impossible iii , &quot; we had amazing visual effects stuff .
so you don &apos;t need the greatest technology to do things that can work in movies .
microsoft first fought off the hacks , but then shifted course when it realized that actively supporting the community came with benefits .
companies can give their employees and customers more control or less . they can worry about how much openness is good for them , and what needs to stay closed .
and she went , &quot; haha . there &apos;s no such thing . &quot;
and when you ask people about connection , the stories they told me were about disconnection .
and that was , the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they &apos;re worthy of love and belonging .
they &apos;re willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out .
and i said , &quot; but here &apos;s the thing : no family stuff , no childhood shit . &quot;
we live in a vulnerable world .
there &apos;s no conversation .
this is what i have found : to let ourselves be seen , deeply seen , vulnerably seen ; to love with our whole hearts , even though there &apos;s no guarantee -- and that &apos;s really hard , and i can tell you as a parent , that &apos;s excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror , when we &apos;re wondering , &quot; can i love you this much ?
and it &apos;s not because people were happy or people were not frustrated .
i still remember the photo .
but actually when people went to the street -- the first time it was thousands of people in alexandria -- it felt like -- it was amazing . it was great because it connected people from the virtual world , bringing them to the real world , sharing the same dream , the same frustration , the same anger , the same desire for freedom .
seriously , with the amount of change i had noticed in this square , i thought it was 12 years .
i feel that i have dignity that i have lost for so many years . &quot;
we think , by studying how the sounds are learned , we &apos;ll have a model for the rest of language , and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social , emotional and cognitive development .
the distribution shows .
what it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language .
we are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child &apos;s brain development .
what is this for ?
i took a speaker , i placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker , and then i added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker .
that &apos;s because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic .
so that &apos;s how those images were made .
and yudhisthira replied , &quot; the most wondrous thing in the world is that all around us people can be dying and we don &apos;t realize it can happen to us . &quot;
but first , compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering .
however , they return to baseline a lot sooner .
they have infused societies with kindness , and we have really felt that as woman after woman has stood on this stage in the past day and a half .
why ?
and what they built was ebox .
if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind ?
let &apos;s see what we get there .
since we &apos;ve correctly calculated the area two different ways , they have to be the same number , and that &apos;s why the squares of one , one , two , three , five and eight add up to eight times 13 .
i was like , &quot; woohoo ! i &apos;m going to travel . &quot;
like i think you &apos;re missing the point here .
&quot; we just wanted to say we tried . &quot;
like in the dubai mall , they sell frozen yogurt by the gram .
i was doing a show , and they said , &quot; we &apos;re going to send a driver to pick you up . &quot;
what &apos;s happening here ? how can this be possible ?
the nodes in the network are the system &apos;s components and the links are given by the interactions .
so we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007 .
so similarly , the control is flowing in the ownership networks and is accumulating at the nodes .
thank you .
self-deception .
so , cells are happily functioning in our bodies .
it can do a tremendous amount of things .
and you can see here , we can actually visualize a single white blood cell .
now , the true power of this technology , however , really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them .
there are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead to at-risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction .
geraldine hamilton : body parts on a chip
and the girl goes , &quot; wha &apos; ? &quot;
but if we look at the human scale , there &apos;s massive problems that aren &apos;t being addressed by those nanoscale technologies .
and then you shake it randomly and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own .
one of those is in extreme environments .
and if you have children , you &apos;ve seen this hundreds of times before .
we &apos;re hoping for both because our business model is , if you come into a therapy session with one problem , we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 , so you keep coming back over and over again .
when i first went in there , i walked into the freshmen dining hall , which is where my friends from waco , texas , which is where i grew up -- i know some of you have heard of it .
that undergirds most of our parenting styles , our managing styles , the way that we motivate our behavior .
singer / songwriter eddi reader performs &quot; what you do with what you &apos;ve got , &quot; a meditation on a very theme : how to use your gifts and talents to make a difference . with thomas dolby on piano .
even in their older years , what we find is that there &apos;s still a problem .
&quot; why do you hate writing , son ? what &apos;s wrong with writing ? &quot;
this is a place for girls .
it &apos;s coming from us .
we have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today .
there &apos;s no doubt that from now on , the fourth of july will be remembered not as the day of the declaration of independence , but as the day of the discovery of the higgs boson .
this is because , according to the laws of quantum mechanics , it is possible to have transitions between two states , even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states , and the phenomenon is called , quite appropriately , quantum tunneling .
so according to these calculations , we are like campers who accidentally set their tent at the edge of a cliff .
just one number , the higgs boson mass , and yet , out of this number we learn so much .
it was in far western new south wales .
so now my obsession is printing , and i &apos;m really fascinated by the idea of using conventional printing processes , so the types of print that are used to create many of the things around us to make paper and card interactive .
and we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better .
so this is my niece , charlotte .
i &apos;d never really memorialized myself .
now like with anything that &apos;s really different from the status quo , it didn &apos;t always go so well testing that aircraft .
that &apos;s real time .
instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger , park it in your garage .
one of the things i &apos;m pointing out is that cartoons appear within the context of the new yorker magazine , that lovely caslon type , and it seems like a fairly benign cartoon within this context .
other people thought it was funny .
paul noth . &quot; he &apos;s all right . i just wish he were a little more pro-israel . &quot;
in each instance , our expectations are defied .
no . no .
&quot; ass-head . please help . &quot;
he laughs . he is both in danger and safe , incredibly aroused . there &apos;s no joke . no joke needed .
it &apos;s called dispositional humor .
that &apos;s why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year called &quot; i don &apos;t get it : the new yorker cartoon i.q. test . &quot;
but , actually , it &apos;s suddenly come to me after years working in the business , that what we create in advertising , which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value , you might call it badge value , subjective value , intangible value of some kind -- gets rather a bad rap .
fredrick the great of prussia was very , very keen for the germans to adopt the potato and to eat it , because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate , wheat and potatoes , you get less price volatility in bread .
these funny signs that flash your speed at you , some of the new ones , on the bottom right , now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face , to act as an emotional trigger .
and there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it .
but if anybody did want to do that , that &apos;s the kind of thing we need to be thinking about , actually : fundamental opportunities to change human behavior .
but this is both hysterically funny -- but i think an important philosophical point , which is , going forward , we need more of this kind of value .
now , not so much .
i thought to myself , &quot; what now ? where do i turn ? &quot;
this led to a full-scale investigation , and i was removed from the house for three days , until they finally decided to ask how i got the bruises .
we were freaks -- lobster claw boys and bearded ladies , oddities juggling depression and loneliness , playing solitaire , spin the bottle , trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal , but at night , while the others slept , we kept walking the tightrope .
and the thing is , i &apos;m a bit older and wiser now , and i know that there &apos;s some noises i &apos;ll never be able to make because i &apos;m hemmed in by my physical body , and there &apos;s things it can &apos;t do .
and now , a rockabilly guitar .
we &apos;re the ones who let the second replicator out of its box , and we can &apos;t push it back in .
and if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive , then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were .
and this is what richard dawkins was on about in his 1976 bestseller , &quot; the selfish gene . &quot;
well , you sir , you &apos;ve got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way .
audience : sink , toilet !
the point of memetics is to say , &quot; oh no , it doesn &apos;t . &quot;
we began , perhaps 5,000 years ago , with writing .
n , the same thing , the number of communicative civilizations out there &#91; that &#93; we might expect in our galaxy .
it &apos;s a really expensive organ to run .
we have babies .
i was spending all my time practicing .
it stretches right across northern canada , in labrador , it &apos;s home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world , the george river caribou herd , numbering approximately 400,000 animals .
within the dimensions of that truck , you could build a 3,000-square-foot two-story home quite easily . i did the math .
so they decided to call it oil sands .
the boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense against global warming and climate change .
some of the greatest densities of , some of the most iconic and threatened species on the planet , and yet there &apos;s a proposal , of course , to build a pipeline to take huge tankers , 10 times the size of the exxon valdez , through some of the most difficult to navigate waters in the world , where only just a few years ago , a b.c. ferry ran aground .
thank you so much .
but these are early incorporations of illusions brought to -- sort of high point with hans holbein &apos;s &quot; ambassadors . &quot; and hans holbein worked for henry viii . this was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull .
this is the largest supermarket in the caribbean at peak shopping time .
what was the difference between chile and haiti ?
do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you &apos;re faced with a complex problem ?
i thought , &quot; great . finally something i can relate to .
and i think you should do something unusual with them , because these are bonus minutes . you weren &apos;t going to have them anyway .
well , hundreds of millions of people use social games like farmville or words with friends to stay in daily contact with real-life friends and family .
i knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade that when we play a game -- and this is in the scientific literature -- we tackle tough challenges with more creativity , more determination , more optimism , and we &apos;re more likely to reach out to others for help .
but scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn &apos;t doom us to suffer indefinitely .
all right , i like the people doing both . you are overachievers .
we &apos;re clapping for that ?
well , here &apos;s my suggestion .
and the nurses told me two things .
and from that point on i started thinking , are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision , or is it a more general case ?
we paid them 10 cents per correct question , 50 cents , a dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars per correct question .
so , we got people to sign , &quot; i understand that this short survey falls under the mit honor code . &quot;
in fact , every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating .
it was about the norms for cheating .
one was that my favorite nurse , ettie , told me that i did not take her pain into consideration .
we had a television for a few years , but of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn &apos;t getting done , so out went the television .
nm : not too fast .
a happy song about global warming , from jill sobule .
this is called the capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; this looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an impostor .
there are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .
if i show you a picture of a lion , or a tiger , or a pinup , you start sweating , right ?
it &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
i said , &quot; move your normal hand . &quot;
and i said , &quot; derek , does this bother you ? &quot;
why does this happen ?
so , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
the patient says , &quot; well , if it &apos;s metallic and shiny , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gold .
maybe it &apos;s something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics .
canopied trees as tall as 40 meters , 130 feet , grow densely in the area .
ss : so kanzi is very interested in fire .
panbanisha is trying to give nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors .
she takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor .
then he peers eagerly into his mother &apos;s mouth .
so we &apos;re sharing tools and technology and language with another species .
i &apos;m going to show you a movie simulation 16 powers of 10 faster than real time , which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out .
he &apos;s 96 years old , and he founded the pugwash movement .
it stores energy in our mobile phones , playstations and laptops .
why should we allow such a wonderful , brilliant and necessary product to be the cause of unnecessary suffering for human beings ?
we let them go about their day . they did whatever they wanted to do .
i drove to the mall in my car , bought a present , gave it to my mom . &quot;
you actually lose money because it doesn &apos;t motivate them to perform any better .
and i was last week walking on lafayette street in manhattan and got a call from a woman who i didn &apos;t know , but she called to tell me that joyce had passed away at the age of 23 .
a third of the jewish population stayed in babylonia .
iran had put itself in isolation because of its radicalism , and after having helped the united states indirectly in the war against iraq in 1991 , the iranians were hoping that they would be rewarded by being included in the post-war security architecture of the region .
but rather than making war inevitable by viewing this as ideological , we would be wise to seek ways to make peace possible .
this is u.k. government data , a completely independent site , where does my money go .
here focusing in on haiti .
now the parents are really alarmed .
so think about a cop .
at that speed , the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel -- 3,500 degrees fahrenheit -- like a blast furnace .
but it too had humble beginnings .
so that glider of yours , the mach 20 glider , the first one , no control , it ended up in the pacific i think somewhere .
rd : sure .
and there is no way , and no proof of arrival .
and in the general election , it &apos;s the citizens who get to vote , but in the lester election , it &apos;s the lesters who get to vote .
in this sense , the funders are our lesters .
it &apos;s a corruption relative to the framers &apos; baseline for this republic .
okay , now , every single one of you knows this .
so it &apos;s fair to ask , how is it possible for them to change this ?
i &apos;m going off to build google glass .
the first building i built was 20 years ago .
and we &apos;ve been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and structure and aesthetics .
so we looked at how we could compose all those elements -- instead of just litter , create one composition .
and the british government saying , &quot; you need to be in the top five . &quot;
and so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue .
this is the head of u.k. trade and investment , who was our client , with the chinese children , using the landscape .
and so the daylight was just coming -- it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed .
it began the space race .
what is real is separateness , and at some point in early babyhood , the idea of self starts to form .
it has an extremely important function .
&quot; so biology , genetics ? &quot; she said .
for a start , we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves .
because , hey , if we &apos;re all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life , then we &apos;re devaluing and desensitizing life .
they &apos;re just practicing .
everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
also , genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is intricately structured .
and just to make a long story short : first of all , the concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness .
i &apos;ll just put that list up for a few seconds , and see if you can guess which two -- i would estimate that probably two of these topics inspired probably 90 percent of the reaction in the various reviews and radio interviews .
students are staying away in droves , universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities .
and the starting point is the -- for that discussion was the fact that we have all been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex .
the choice is whether certain facts about humans , or topics , are to be considered taboos , forbidden knowledge , where we shouldn &apos;t go there because no good can come from it , or whether we should explore them honestly .
and i said , &quot; who &apos;s tony ? &quot;
he looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane .
am i crossing my legs like a journalist ? &quot;
so there &apos;s 1,500 people in his room .
now al dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies .
he said he got accepted into west point , and they don &apos;t let delinquents in west point .
everyone &apos;s a bit psychopathic . &quot;
is there a definitive line that divides crazy from sane ? with a hair-raising delivery , jon ronson , author of &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; the psychopath test &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; , illuminates the gray areas between the two . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i wouldn &apos;t tell them what it was , but it was in alphabetical order , and i would tell them to look for their names , their family names , their mother &apos;s maiden name .
it &apos;s just necessary or interesting that it might have one good , unique trait .
we have two rolls of the dice to get this right .
and this next picture shows it in context , in svalbard .
i can &apos;t look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a solution for climate change , for the water crisis .
somebody has to take the lead , and i decided to do it .
digital scrotum , digital media .
we need to inspire them , because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future .
and this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now . we thought there &apos;d be animals there ; we knew there were plants there ; the colors change , right ?
you know , a good example , of course , is the darpa net .
oh , it &apos;s going to be so much fun .
what &apos;s out there is there &apos;s something really interesting going to happen here .
i think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered .
and these are two of the penguins &apos; main breeding islands .
personally , i really didn &apos;t know if i was capable of handling such a monstrous task .
but an interesting thing was noted during the training process .
and they could be extinct in less than 10 years , if we don &apos;t do something now to protect them .
but then i noticed all their friends were like them , so that was a bad theory .
they use techniques that he &apos;s never heard of , and for his half a million dollars in prize money , rob mcewen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold .
well , it didn &apos;t work so well for the record labels , did it ?
there was no concept of progress .
the revolution is called angiogenesis , and it &apos;s based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels .
so here we go .
so here is a nine year-old boxer named milo who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder .
that &apos;s impressive .
they &apos;re all common ones : chinese jasmine , japanese sencha , earl grey and a special blend that we prepared .
check out this ad from blue cross blue shield of minnesota .
the angiogenesis foundation is following almost 300 companies , and there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline .
and there , for the first time , i encountered the other religious traditions : judaism and islam , the sister religions of christianity .
and it was -- the golden rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called &quot; ren , &quot; human-heartedness , which was a transcendent experience in itself .
and so many of our institutions , even football , which used to be a pleasant pastime , now causes riots where people even die .
this comes from &quot; the iliad . &quot; but it tells you what this spirituality should be .
people want to be religious , says scholar karen armstrong ; we should help make religion a force for harmony . she asks the community to help build a charter for compassion -- to restore the golden rule as the central global religious doctrine .
i have never , ever experienced anything like that in my life .
really popular . people congregated around it .
put that at the heart of your school culture , and you will create a different generation .
if you ever think , &quot; ah , i want to end it all , &quot; don &apos;t end it all .
the fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes , and therefore we love it .
i &apos;m glad the universe is pointless .
i want to know about wrongness itself , the idea of wrong .
damon horowitz teaches philosophy through the prison university project , bringing college-level classes to inmates of san quentin state prison . in this powerful short talk , he tells the story of an encounter with right and wrong that quickly gets personal .
if you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large , you had to live with a smaller gut .
fundamentally it &apos;s a consumption issue .
we &apos;ve spent a great deal of time investigating a $ 1 billion -- that &apos;s right , a $ 1 billion — oil deal that he was involved with , and what we found was pretty shocking , but more about that later .
a bank in paris held accounts of companies controlled by him , one of which was used to buy the art , and american banks , well , they funneled 73 million dollars into the states , some of which was used to buy that california mansion .
a recent study by the world bank looked at 200 cases of corruption .
now , it just shouldn &apos;t take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went .
and i want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell , the oppression of these cells , the reinterpretation of these cells , the undermining of these cells , getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing , eradicating , destroying , reducing these cells , basically began the process of killing off the girl cell , which was , by the way , patriarchy .
and i will tell you that what happened is through that shattering , listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated , who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes , literally , inside them where their pee and poop came out of them .
and if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be , including lack of access to healthcare , education , healthy foods , labor force participation .
they kidnapped her , they put her in a car .
so , one afternoon , she &apos;d heard about the safe house , jaclyn left her father &apos;s house and she walked for two days , two days through masai land .
i &apos;m an emotional creature ! &quot;
don &apos;t tell me not to cry , to calm it down , not to be so extreme , to be reasonable .
( &quot; yes , books . you know , the bound volumes with ink on paper .
now , what is the story here ?
and the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image , and he wanted to explore what was underlying that .
this story was a real puzzle .
so we &apos;re talking about different planes , different pieces of paper .
so , as you can see evidenced by such examples , age has absolutely nothing to do with it .
true story , by the way .
no matter your position or place in life , it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away .
they were wrong . the kids &apos; number one wish ?
he was very frustrated with how software got designed .
&quot; that &apos;s what i thought , &quot; she said .
we constantly have to kind of dial them back .
i met a celebrity chef in new orleans who said , &quot; no problem , i &apos;ll just time-shift family dinner .
enlist the children in their own upbringing .
we did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat .
spend time retelling the story of your family &apos;s positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones .
what i have here is a cinder block that we &apos;ve coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
so what are the applications ?
and our friend , betty edwards , the &quot; drawing on the right side of the brain &quot; lady , shows these two tables to her drawing class and says , &quot; the problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can &apos;t move your hand , but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty .
but murray gell-mann yesterday talked about emergent properties ; another name for them could be &quot; architecture &quot; as a metaphor for taking the same old material and thinking about non-obvious , non-simple ways of combining it .
you can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there .
see the car turn by five here ?
student 4l : &#91; i decided to &#93; do the shot put and the sponge ball because they &apos;re two totally different weights , and if you drop them at the same time , maybe they &apos;ll drop at the same speed .
but we couldn &apos;t create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life .
sobule : take it , julia . sweeney : okay . oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine .
where other scientists would play in their laboratory , tesla created his inventions in his mind .
his legacy is with us still .
so there are areas of the brain that are dedicated to controlling your movement or your vision or your memory or your appetite , and so on .
we want you to stop doing that . &quot;
so the first thing we did was , we compared , what &apos;s different in the brain of someone with depression and someone who is normal , and what we did was pet scans to look at the blood flow of the brain , and what we noticed is that in patients with depression compared to normals , areas of the brain are shut down , and those are the areas in blue .
the brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose .
it involves the work of engineers , of imaging scientists , of basic scientists , of neurologists , psychiatrists , neurosurgeons , and certainly at the interface of these multiple disciplines that there &apos;s the excitement .
and we lay our eggs there , we don &apos;t have to worry about other eggs or anything like that .
like , how do they know that &apos;s the time ?
and i looked into this trusting , loving face , and i said , &quot; oh , no .
so the fearsome power of this little insect was apparent to me from a very young age , and it &apos;s one reason why i spent five years as a journalist trying to understand , why has malaria been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long ?
so it &apos;s not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects .
they ask people in malarious parts of the world , &quot; what do you think about malaria ? &quot;
it was the brainchild of the u.s. state department .
they have to sleep under them every night .
that &apos;s exactly what we did in the 1950s , and that effort backfired .
any computer designers in the room ?
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
there was an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in africa .
i mean , they didn &apos;t agree with each other -- that was not the point .
thank you .
how do we make this different ?
and i took it with my roommate , carrie , who was then a brilliant literary student -- and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar -- and my brother -- smart guy , but a water-polo-playing pre-med , who was a sophomore .
i wish i could tell that to my daughter .
and she said , &quot; i learned something today .
and she starts thinking about having a child , and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child , she starts thinking about making room for that child .
i have two children .
audience : it &apos;s people logging on to google around the world .
this is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions .
more animals , if they start doing searches as well .
and now we &apos;ve grown to over 100,000 members .
and this is how we keep our innovation running .
we also like to innovate in our physical space , and we noticed in meetings , you know , you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off , and they &apos;re noisy , so people shut them off .
so the idea is we can make advertising useful , not just annoying , right ?
and our algorithms -- not a person , of course , but our algorithms , our computers -- read his blog and decided that the related search was , &quot; i am bored . &quot;
but getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air .
thank you .
so i decided to give it a try .
when i was in high school i had created project v.o.i.c.e .
but i try to walk through life like this .
i think december 54th was probably supposed to be 24th .
but in that instant , i get to share your present .
so for example , you come to the polling station , and a poll station worker asks for your id before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a voting booth to fill out your vote .
and there &apos;s some complicated cryptography going on in there , but what &apos;s not complicated is voting with one of these forms .
i &apos;m going to talk about religion .
each country &apos;s a bubble .
i start the world , and here we go .
because the death of a child is compensated by one more child .
i went to the statistical authority of qatar , to their webpage -- it &apos;s a very good webpage . i recommend it -- and i looked up -- oh yeah , you can have lots of fun here -- and provided free of charge , i found qatar &apos;s social trends .
and there are two billion children in the world .
that is needed .
when we &apos;re turning , we have the feeling of surfing , and the way it &apos;s going up-wind , it &apos;s very efficient .
essentially , open hardware is a license .
i was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses .
then mother teresa , another mystic warrior , who said , &quot; the problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small . &quot;
and we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated , and you can use them too , because i know you &apos;re all going to take an other to lunch .
will the heavens open and &quot; we are the world &quot; play over the restaurant sound system ?
it doesn &apos;t really matter . it &apos;s the same mosquito , and it &apos;s the same disease . you &apos;re at risk .
you &apos;ve got to get your chemical into every puddle , every birdbath , every tree trunk .
it &apos;s only the female mosquito that will actually bite you .
we &apos;ve separated the males from the females .
well , i understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
so then i decided to leave that part of the world , and i was going to go to the mid-west .
how many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
i &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea bill , because of this report . &quot;
it &apos;s a worry -- isn &apos;t it ? -- that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information how does it work ?
and so it came in from the outside .
there were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
j not that we have seen with anything we have released .
who &apos;s got the hero view ?
that &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
yeah , well , i certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
j i &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
that is my grandfather .
these clipboards are filled with numbers .
lauren hodge : if you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option , which would you choose , grilled or fried chicken ?
however , it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab -- so i could finally start my project .
and that was my first science fair project .
so that &apos;s what we set out to do .
and the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of hiv and tuberculosis combined .
i &apos;ve assumed that she lives in an average household with average air pollutant levels .
your google science fair champions .
today i &apos;ll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus .
and the question is a simple one : do we have enough phosphorus to feed our future generations ?
in 2030 , we &apos;ll reach the peak .
now , imagine this tiny , microscopic mushroom .
on the left side , you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture , with a 100 percent phosphorus dose .
and , from my experience , you know , kids are naturally curious about what they don &apos;t know , or don &apos;t understand , or is foreign to them .
so at the time , it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs .
the artist matthew barney , in his film opus called the &quot; the cremaster cycle . &quot;
it is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency .
so i guess both susan boyle and this vegetable vendor in shanghai belonged to otherness .
and my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
it shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions , which lacked transparency in the past .
so what do they do ? they have to share space -- squeezed in very limited space to save money -- and they call themselves &quot; tribe of ants . &quot;
sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest .
and here also people are helping to find missing children .
these cows are used for beef . we &apos;re going to eat these cows .
so we &apos;re using an enormous amount of land for agriculture , but also we &apos;re using a lot of water .
it &apos;s an extraordinary change .
it &apos;s more than all other manufacturing , in fact .
the green areas here show where corn yields , just showing corn as an example , are already really high , probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we &apos;re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get .
but how ?
there is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture .
and i thought she &apos;d say , &quot; oh , you know , up the lagoon somewhere , or maybe across africa , &quot; but you &apos;ll be happy to know she said it came from here , it comes from the north sea .
so it &apos;s vast . but it should come with an asterisk , and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers of the world .
they &apos;re going to eddy in lagos .
first , it would be to understand that it could be considered a cooperative , and this is a thought from the brazilian legal scholar roberto mangabeira unger .
it was come dark and rain , will make you weary and tired .
it &apos;s not a lot different than the one you see on my patient .
well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain , going down your spinal cord , out the nerves and to your periphery .
and he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches .
his hand sensation grew into his chest again probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat , so the skin was right down to the muscle and deinnervated , if you would , his skin .
tk : so it was a little slow ?
you can move each finger . you can move your thumb , your wrist .
so now it &apos;s able to train with just this little piece on the back .
she said that when she just ran it across the table , it felt like her finger was rocking .
we took out a whole circuit in the hotel and just about put on the fire alarm .
now not all lies are harmful .
we &apos;re essentially against lying .
the rest of us , we &apos;re only 54 percent accurate .
let the science temper your knowledge a little bit .
john edwards : i &apos;d be happy to participate in one .
that bothers me the most .
maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of hiv patients .
now , in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver , the answer is straightforward .
it &apos;s an all too common story : after participating in an hiv clinical trial , a woman in sub-saharan africa is left without the resources to buy a bus ticket to her health clinic , let alone to afford life-saving antiretrovirals . boghuma kabisen titanji asks an important question : how can researchers looking for a cure make sure they &apos;re not taking advantage of those most affected by the pandemic ?
and i doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes .
what i found out i was studying is really the difference in how the galapagos changes , the most extreme variation .
here , you can see where punta tombo is , and they breed in incredibly dense colonies .
so what we &apos;re seeing now is very few penguins are oiled .
this is turbo the penguin .
she &apos;s really rushing back , because it &apos;s hot , to try to feed her chicks .
as long as the city &apos;s putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged , then of course people aren &apos;t going to be engaged .
this helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about .
but we can change all those things i mentioned .
first , we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body . strange .
this lady is ellen van der zweep . she &apos;s one of the best dog-trainers in the world , and she believes that we can do a lot more .
that &apos;s the kind of out-of-the-box science that i love doing , for the betterment of mankind , but especially for her , so that she can grow up in a world without malaria . thank you .
but my joyful period was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts -- thoughts of walking through the prison &apos;s high-security death row , as this was the only route to take me to the makeshift operating room .
if this research is successful , it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .
thank you .
they take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product .
and they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs , giving them small loans .
ultimately , coke &apos;s success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a coca-cola .
and i think that &apos;s a mistake .
can you you believe that ?
so many more people would have been affected .
in her talk , melinda gates makes a provocative case for nonprofits taking a cue from corporations such as coca-cola , whose plugged-in , global network of marketers and distributors ensures that every remote village wants -- and can get -- a coke . why shouldn &apos;t this work for condoms , sanitation , vaccinations too ? &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i mean , look , it doesn &apos;t take a double-blind , placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work .
i &apos;m serious .
now wait a minute , you may say , how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first ?
but we &apos;ll certainly learn a lot .
they are coupled to light receptors similar to the ones in your eyes .
and we &apos;ve come a long way since galvani &apos;s and susana &apos;s first successes in making animals twitch or jump .
the fly should learn to avoid the optically reinforced odor .
if the connection is strong , the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn .
they don &apos;t know anything about you . wake up .
they &apos;re not approved to do this . patients are not approved to do this .
based on the other images we have , i &apos;m really happy how it looks today .
now the software is also getting smarter , right ?
we &apos;re trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors caring for themselves as well as the care provided by their family members or volunteer community health workers , as well as have an exchange network online , where , for example , i can donate three hours of care a day to your mom , if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals , and we exchange all of that online .
because at the end of the day these technologies are simply about people caring for other people and ourselves in some powerful new ways .
the lesson of brian &apos;s presentation , in a way -- all those fantastic pictures -- is this really : that vantage point determines everything that you see .
it was boring .
so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of kenya or britain .
what do they look like ?
waiting 10 years for the payoff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs , when you &apos;ve got siblings to look after or a business to help with .
imagine that urban explosion that &apos;s going to take place across the developing world and how many thousands of children will spend their school years on building sites .
and there will be no mistakes . &quot;
you &apos;d need millions and millions of teachers in china , india , nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need .
it &apos;s recognizably 19th century in its roots .
&quot; there &apos;s one thing more -- there &apos;s just one more thing you better understand .
and after i &apos;m done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic , my partner and i , we get together and we decide that we &apos;re gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun .
it &apos;s wonderful .
not based upon the quality of your work , how long you &apos;ve been there , if you stink , just if you &apos;re gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered .
people who happened to be women didn &apos;t have the same rights , couldn &apos;t vote .
let &apos;s look at some data .
welcome to the economics of abundance .
so does that mean we have nothing to worry about ?
what they had was better teamwork , and they showed that a team of humans and computers , working together , could beat any computer or any human working alone .
because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it , hoping that your sex cells , your male sex cells , which are held within the pollen , will somehow reach another flower just by chance .
and here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic , because the mimic doesn &apos;t give it any nectar . it thought it would get some .
they fly in and they pollinate .
now wouldn &apos;t you know it , there &apos;s some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature .
just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot ; it was just attached to the tripod , not killed -- then under ultraviolet light , look at that .
and i got scared .
what was i supposed to accomplish in this final act ?
how many of you are checking it right now ?
turn off your air conditioning , turn on your fans .
twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted , and when i say wasted , i don &apos;t mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs . they may .
there are many experts who can help answer harriet &apos;s question .
see again , the diversity .
and then you can see people celebrating the next day .
i think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid .
so there were no longer shoe makers , but now there are people slapping soles on people &apos;s shoes .
when hal &apos;s dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song , as a reference to when computers became human .
this is actually two of my favorites : the pin-board thom yorke and a lego thom yorke .
collaborator five : as much as is different from frame to frame , it really is personal .
but most importantly , i think , we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the johnny cash project , where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone .
and so has my other incredible collaborator , mark cutkosky , at stanford -- he made much larger hairs than the gecko , but used the same general principles .
you see something on it . it &apos;s not just to look like a gecko .
it can also be used in defense .
okay , now we wondered , if we were right , we should be able to test this in a physical model , in a robot .
watch the animal .
well , then you &apos;d be screwed because you &apos;d know what to wish for and you &apos;d used up your wish .
but i &apos;d like to talk about another way to travel that doesn &apos;t require a ship or an airplane , and just requires a movie camera , a projector and a screen .
and i think the most important reaction that i saw there was actually people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves , that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances .
maybe i will never be able to do it .
in the arab world -- and it &apos;s not really by the film ; it &apos;s by the characters .
we still have paradise .
george : on that day , at around 6 : 30 i was driving with my wife and daughters to the supermarket .
i &apos;ve been listening to the talks in some of the conference , and robert wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person &apos;s humanity , then they will have an appreciation for ours .
and we started calling up everybody .
this particular idea , however -- although we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s right or wrong , and at the end i &apos;ll discuss experiments which , in the next few years , may tell us whether it &apos;s right or wrong -- this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research .
that is this new idea about how gravity actually works .
number one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?
in our era , a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself , many others around the world , it &apos;s called superstring theory , as you were indicating .
the different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us .
and string theory suggests that those 20 numbers have to do with the extra dimensions .
the hope is that if the collision has enough energy , it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions , forcing it to enter into the other dimensions .
one of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs .
the next time you see somebody driving a ferrari don &apos;t think , &quot; this is somebody who is greedy . &quot;
the closer two people are , in age , in background , in the process of identification , the more there is a danger of envy -- which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion -- because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with .
there is a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser , and that shows 400 years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives .
but something very valuable in that idea , nevertheless .
i gave them the plotline of madame bovary .
and one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means .
and make sure that we own them , that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions .
and it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another .
they are the same , as far as your eye is concerned .
why ? because it wouldn &apos;t have been useful in the past .
we have two identical tiles , on the left , one in a dark surround , one in a light surround .
so here we have -- let &apos;s turn this around -- a diamond .
we pull them out , put them in the fridge , and they fall asleep .
well , one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world .
so what i &apos;d like to finish with is this over here .
damn it , even the books here are made out of plants .
they have thousands of people all over the world tagging places where those plants are said to exist .
this is at least 100 times bigger .
in fact , understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking -- some of the chemistry , some of the physics and so forth .
well , that first cutaway picture worked , so we said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s do some more . &quot;
and the answer is : no , not really ; we use a machine shop .
it &apos;s a partial differential equation .
as it comes out of the grinder , you just have a little tray , and you just take it off in little passes , build it up , slice it vertically .
a friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen , so there &apos;s a sixth volume that has washable , waterproof paper .
they were happy . they had their plans .
then you sell a lot more .
now that is surgical thinking .
this was truly a revolution in surgery .
we bring instruments in , from two separate cuts in the side , and then you can start manipulating tissue .
you have a 3d camera , so you get a 3d view .
how would that change the capabilities of the surgeon ?
now we know where we need to cut , even when it &apos;s below the surface .
and i would never want to deprive you of that epiphany .
at the time , there was a lot of opposition .
there &apos;s a point , you can stand here and see buildings by frank gehry , jean nouvel , shigeru ban , neil denari .
the discovery that had led to penicillin , for example , is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time .
although they &apos;re part of the plastic , they &apos;re not covalently bonded to the plastic backbone .
mw : so now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates , we wondered what these bacteria were .
it was the early &apos; 90s , and i was at a public event .
well , this map in the sort of redder , yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery .
i knew i had to do anything i could to earn some money to support the people i care about . &quot;
d : interesting . micheal , bottom line , what do you recommend ?
what would it be like to meet frederick douglass ? &quot;
we understand that it &apos;s expensive here : about 30,000 dollars .
we said to her , &quot; are you worried ? are you upset ? &quot;
but that &apos;s not all , because superconductors don &apos;t like magnetic fields .
but that &apos;s not the amazing part yet , because there is something i haven &apos;t told you yet .
and , working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer , i went and bought the cheapest toaster i could find , took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that , inside this object , which i &apos;d bought for just 3.49 pounds , there were 400 different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials .
this is the first textbook on metallurgy and there you can see that woodcut is basically what i ended up doing .
and you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants , but also from starches .
but i considered it a partial success , to be honest .
and it doesn &apos;t just apply to computation .
i &apos;ve been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years .
spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year .
the last third of the nine-week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address some major challenge of humanity .
and it can &apos;t be done .
but understand what you &apos;re looking at we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female , so that we could put it in any of these people .
this sound colors our first impression of any room ; it can &apos;t be helped .
although they make no claim to architectural beauty , they are , in their perfect temporariness , a delightful alternative to the large-scale structures that might someday take their place .
i envision a 36-story , 450-unit residential high-rise -- a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission .
right now , america is in an unremitting state of trauma .
and there it is kind of grown , at least one particular section of it .
and that &apos;s the way it is with definitions of words .
on an elemental level , we have all felt that spirituality at the time of childbirth .
so , you go back to the old indo-european root again , and what do you find ? the indo-european stem is pronounced payen -- we would spell it p-a-e-n -- and , lo and behold , mirabile dictu , it is the same root as the word compassion comes from , p-a-e-n .
movement is the only way you have of affecting the world around you .
and we &apos;ll see you have to both perceive and act on the world , which has a lot of problems .
forget about trying to hit the bull &apos;s eye in darts , just aim for the same spot over and over again .
you accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories .
imagine , as i shake the ketchup bottle , someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me .
and one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys , they get into fights -- which started with one of them doing something to the other , the other retaliating .
and if we look at what we start with , a quarter of a newton there , a number of turns , perfect would be that red line .
and perhaps in life , movements get better through learning .
and it uses it very differently once you think about it that way .
i could have told you 50 others just like it -- all the times that i got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go , that i should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert .
and kids are working in countless group assignments .
you might be following the person with the best ideas , but you might not .
here &apos;s a novel by milan kundera .
and i want to be clear about what i &apos;m saying , because i deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual , chatty cafe-style types of interactions -- you know , the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas .
that stuff &apos;s cool . &quot;
just beautiful .
and some people will fund their entire lego habit by selling the little guy , but then you have no guys in your ships .
and we &apos;ve reached that time . we cannot afford to underestimate this problem . if we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences , we must act , and we must act decisively .
and maybe most important , they have a big effect on other companies .
and bob epstein raised a hand . he stood up .
that &apos;s 59 billion dollars since 1975 that they didn &apos;t ship to the middle east .
and we &apos;re encouraging others to do it as well .
we &apos;ve got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome , the profitable outcome , and therefore the likely outcome .
and in some countries -- let me pick afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don &apos;t go to school .
her mother had not gone to primary school .
right , the famous chinese character for picnic area .
and i think that &apos;s some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots .
so office workers became programmers of spreadsheets .
we &apos;ve got a conveyor there .
it just moves it around , and the robot figures out that was an area search .
this is the percentage of adults who are working age .
but over the course of several years , i &apos;ve been documenting rem koolhaas &apos;s cctv building in beijing and the olympic stadium in the same city by the architects herzog and de meuron .
and on the 30th floor , there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed .
while to most of us , living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable , to those in the zabbaleen , this is just a different type of normal .
from makoko to zabbaleen , these communities have approached the tasks of planning , design and management of their communities and neighborhoods in ways that respond specifically to their environment and circumstances .
so , so and so patients have been diagnosed with something , or other patients have been diagnosed , and all these data are fed into a central repository , with some delay .
but not all positions in the network are the same .
it can be expensive , not feasible , unethical , or , frankly , just not possible to do such a thing .
now , in addition to that , if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic or to predict the adoption of a product , for example , what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population , also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the randoms and the friends .
it cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly .
and we see a blip up in the truckers &apos; purchases of fuel , and we know that a recession is about to end .
let me show you how it works .
what you &apos;re looking at in here is a 3d viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of &#91; the &#93; cloud of points in real time , cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions .
let me close with another short story .
and doug pritchard , who &apos;s the head of visualization at the glasgow school of art .
we had holocaust education in the schools .
it will refer you directly to your congressperson , to your u.s. senator , to your governor where divestment legislation is pending .
european governments , for the most part , haven &apos;t acknowledged responsibility , and there &apos;s nothing to kind of to push back and up against .
what he was was a decathlete of nation-building , of problem-solving , of troubleshooting in the world &apos;s worst places and in the world &apos;s most broken places .
let me go door-to-door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation .
one of them had been at 9 / 11 and lost his buddies on september 11th , and yet went in and risked his life in order to save sergio .
you can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person , that regime , is the problem and that you , the united states , are not the problem .
and the lesson , i think , of the anti-genocide movement that i mentioned , that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do -- it &apos;ll be many decades , probably , before that happens -- but is that if we want to see change , we have to become the change .
that very human lesson , more than 20 years ago , served me well during the last economic downturn we had .
but as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers , i realized we had no metrics .
on a trip through india , early in his reign as king , he was asked by an indian journalist about the bhutanese gdp , the size of the bhutanese gdp .
how many know him ? anybody ?
certainly robert kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that .
they aren &apos;t the same .
some are driven by compassion , feel it &apos;s perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity .
and i was just struck that this is out of place .
i &apos;d like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is .
eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net .
and during harvest , put it back with interest , food interest .
perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that bill gates , howard buffett and others have supported boldly , which is to ask the question : what if , instead of looking at the hungry as victims -- and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families -- what if we view them as the solution , as the value chain to fight hunger ?
the amazing thing i &apos;ve found is nothing can change on a big scale without the determination of a leader .
each eod team goes out on about 600 of these bomb calls every year , defusing about two bombs a day .
and we need to remember that we &apos;re talking about the model t fords , the wright flyers , compared to what &apos;s coming soon .
that raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict . good guys might play around and work on these as hobby kits , but so might bad guys .
the typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site . missile hits , bodies burst into the air with the explosion .
moore &apos;s law is operative , but so &apos;s murphy &apos;s law .
then it &apos;s just a product recall issue . &quot;
most people find that very soothing , and , interestingly , 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human .
for people who can &apos;t get away from noise like that , it &apos;s extremely damaging for their health .
1.8 billion times a day , that tune is played .
together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the south pole .
i &apos;m telling you , crossing these things with 170-pound sled , that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds , because that &apos;s what it felt like .
and a year before that i was a pack-a-day smoker , living a very sedentary lifestyle .
it runs out of space .
but the real big step was the neocortex .
but you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these columns , the note is going to be off .
and your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way .
so you need 10,000 laptops .
but i hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain .
well , the problem was in thinking that the insect wings function in the way that aircraft wings work . but they don &apos;t .
but all of this sensory information has to be processed by a brain , and yes , indeed , flies have a brain , a brain of about 100,000 neurons .
they have to engage in courtship .
and i think , from an engineering perspective , you think of multiplexing .
here &apos;s a fly and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator , and this is a game the flies love to play .
an insect &apos;s ability to fly is perhaps one of the greatest feats of evolution . michael dickinson looks at how a fruit fly takes flight with such delicate wings , thanks to a clever flapping motion and flight muscles that are both powerful and nimble . but the secret ingredient : the incredible fly brain .
this all came from a professor waking up at night to the third night in a row that his wife &apos;s cellphone was beeping because it was running out of battery power .
imagine driving into your garage -- we &apos;ve built a system to do this -- you drive into your garage , and the car charges itself , because there is a mat on the floor that &apos;s plugged into the wall .
because remember dr. soljacic &apos;s original idea was his wife &apos;s cellphone beeping .
but it &apos;s just one chemical .
i &apos;d pump him for information , i &apos;m mentally scribbling notes for the stories i plan to write .
he built a playhouse for our daughter .
and terence died six days later .
right up until days before his death , i felt strongly and powerfully , and , you might say , irrationally , that i could keep him from dying ever .
maybe we don &apos;t need a new piece of paper .
how can we learn that people &apos;s decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly , powerfully , many times irrationally , on the slimmest of hopes ?
and that &apos;s problematic in terms of the rollout of vaccines .
we &apos;ve talked about it being needle-free -- these are projections that you can &apos;t even see -- and , of course , we get around the needle phobia issue as well .
the world of vaccines is getting better .
now , of course , we &apos;ve worked within my lab with many other vaccines that have attained similar responses and similar curves to this , what we &apos;ve achieved with influenza .
but also , papua new guinea has the world &apos;s highest incidence of hpv , human papillomavirus , the cervical cancer &#91; risk factor &#93; .
so virtual earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation , comprehensive , of the entire world .
in fact , it was always done manual .
not yours , of course -- other people &apos;s .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write , because there is so much feedback you can get from people .
turns out they &apos;re identical .
right ? how much do you care about people ?
we wake up in the morning and we open the closet and we feel that we decide what to wear .
here is a patient . he is a 67-year-old farmer .
but the moment you set this as the default it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing .
and they passed me from one person to another to another , until eventually i got to a person who was in charge of the website .
i &apos;ll show you graphic images of people -- not real people .
the silver lining is , i think , kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting .
and we are simply running out of spectrum .
and in the middle there , we have this visible light spectrum .
let &apos;s go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum -- go to remote controls .
put your book beneath it and you can read .
efficiency : this is data through illumination -- it &apos;s first of all an illumination device .
well you may see the impact already now .
and you need a strong government to do that , because you cannot respect private property rights .
so exactly why did china grow so much faster ?
yasheng huang : does democracy stifle economic growth ?
are there recurring patterns that we can learn from , that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives , or our own organizations , or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative ?
so they started to think , &quot; could we build a neonatal incubator that &apos;s built entirely out of automobile parts ? &quot;
so when they were sitting in front of the microscope , when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler , and all these things .
and so what you realize is that darwin , in a sense , had the idea , he had the concept , but was unable of fully thinking it yet .
that &apos;s an interesting idea . &quot;
could you figure out an unknown location on the ground , if you knew the location of the satellite ? &quot;
i &apos;m kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it .
that &apos;s the thing .
wk : yeah .
and so , that lit a light for the house ? how many lights ?
when i was a student here in oxford in the 1970s , the future of the world was bleak .
it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
no other animal does it .
you render it down . you make a candle , etc. etc .
louis xiv had a lot of people working for him .
and the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
people forget that . people think of trade as a modern thing .
nobody , literally nobody .
but i &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , i &apos;m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
here are the numbers one to 12 as i see them -- every number with its own shape and character .
let &apos;s go back to the questions i posed you a moment ago .
let &apos;s have a look at the third question .
or when you drink a little too much at a party , just out of anxiety .
so , i wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms , and in the actual print of this piece , each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge .
and this is what the next piece is about .
and one of the causes of this , i think , is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview , this holoptical worldview , this holographic image that we &apos;re all trying to create in our mind of the interconnection of things : the environmental footprints 1,000 miles away of the things that we buy ; the social consequences 10,000 miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers .
they were living in hungary , and my mother was born .
and so i thought , &quot; maybe if it can promote cell growth , it can inhibit cell death , too . &quot;
and i really think that we can &apos;t think about cancer -- let alone any disease -- in such black-and-white terms .
and i guess i &apos;ll keep investigating until i get the answers .
and can we utilize -- can we take this property , this compound , this receptor , whatever it is that &apos;s controlling these anti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general ?
as it was the custom of the time , copernicus was actually simply buried in an unmarked grave , together with 14 others in that cathedral .
and as you see on this animation , what kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star .
finally , 15 years ago , the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star , and we actually did pretty well .
and the number , as you might expect , is pretty staggering .
when we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life , we think of compartmentalization , keeping the molecules which are important for life in a membrane , isolated from the rest of the environment , but yet , in an environment in which they actually could originate together .
and look at this image of the tiny , blue dot .
if that was the age of the universe , then this is the age of life on earth .
black men ski . black men ski .
that &apos;s the only way that we could have done this .
what &apos;s mine communicating to you ?
i notice a couple of things about this .
physiologically , there also are differences on two key hormones : testosterone , which is the dominance hormone , and cortisol , which is the stress hormone .
here &apos;s what you get on cortisol . high-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease , and the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase .
we also evaluate these people much more positively overall . &quot;
and the night before my first-year talk , and the first-year talk at princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people . that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s what you want to do . configure your brain to cope the best in that situation .
but first , i have a new invention here .
in spite of pepfar , the generous pepfar , all people are not reached by treatment , and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries , only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years .
there &apos;s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &apos;s not the case .
after all , if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex , the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000 .
the world wide web ? not so sure .
there are a lot of ideas to die for .
well , many theories . but how could something tie them together ?
if they are , words are memes that can be pronounced .
we &apos;re doing it this time with toxic ideas .
work out the implications .
and the blue line is the ratio of american to chinese .
it was also being asked at roughly the same time by the resterners -- by the people in the rest of the world -- like ibrahim muteferrika , an ottoman official , the man who introduced printing , very belatedly , to the ottoman empire -- who said in a book published in 1731 , &quot; why do christian nations which were so weak in the past compared with muslim nations begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious ottoman armies ? &quot;
that is so right and so cool .
that really was a killer application .
japan was the first non-western society to embrace it .
it &apos;s our generation that is witnessing the end of western predominance .
the west may collapse very suddenly .
i think that &apos;s its real importance .
and the bigger your gesture gets , the more ill-defined , blurry and , frankly , useless it is to the orchestra .
we then thought we &apos;d make a movie of &quot; carmen , &quot; which we recorded and shot outside on location in the township outside cape town called khayelitsha .
if i sing you a musical scale : a , b , c , d , e , f , g -- and i just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet , same scale : h , i , j , k , l , m , n , o , p , q , r , s , t -- there you go .
the music will start , and then at a signal from me , you will sing that .
i &apos;m 22 , and i &apos;m a left-handed pianist .
i want to start with a story , a la seth godin , from when i was 12 years old .
we focused on a business model ; we insisted on skin in the game .
they typically pay for critical goods and services like water , like healthcare , like housing , and they pay 30 to 40 times what their middleclass counterparts pay -- certainly where we work in karachi and nairobi .
a lot of hurdles .
first , she talked about comfort , status , beauty .
so what this figure shows is that spiders date back to almost 380 million years .
they differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color .
what silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences , these amino acid sequences , to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers .
the 21 species are indicated here by this phylogeny , this evolutionary tree , that shows their genetic relationships , and i &apos;ve colored in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders .
cheryl hayashi studies spider silk , one of nature &apos;s most high-performance materials . each species of spider can make up to 7 very different kinds of silk . how do they do it ? hayashi explains at the dna level -- then shows us how this super-strong , super-flexible material can inspire .
somehow , what we need to do is step back from those situations , like that wise old woman , look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel .
it may take two days , three days , four days , but they don &apos;t rest until they find a resolution , or better yet , a reconciliation .
i started reacting , but then i tried to remember to go to the balcony .
let &apos;s see if we can apply the third side to it .
because the simple way to do that is you go for a walk .
let me ask you a question .
and so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
but they did it thanks to a common identity -- europe -- and a common economy .
i thought if i skipped it might help my nerves , but i &apos;m actually having a paradoxical reaction to that , so that was a bad idea .
i can actually do all sorts of things . i can play with a violin bow . i don &apos;t have to use the chopsticks .
now this was a really exciting experience for me .
this is &quot; tlön , &quot; for three conductors and no players .
mark applebaum : the mad scientist of music
and then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; eww , yuck , crackers .
and crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
and the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
all right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
and there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
so when you put four .
so they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
one , i care that you spell it right .
our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us .
you can make the baby poop .
he &apos;s like , &quot; huh ! &quot;
if you think about it , in history , a long , long time ago we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual .
and then i was there on september 11th , and i stood in the streets with everyone .
i think the challenge for us is -- i &apos;m very certain that that will happen , the challenge is , will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device ?
if you shine a light on them , they produce electricity .
we have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling that still works , roughly . that &apos;s tamiflu .
and if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly , you can use a more powerful force , a market force , to provide feedback .
and our system was rudimentary . it was very basic .
you see this with twitter , too . you get this information overload .
but that &apos;s when i take out his letters and i read them , and the paper that touched his hand is in mine , and i feel connected to him .
but now what we &apos;re looking at is not an extension of the physical self , but an extension of the mental self , and because of that , we &apos;re able to travel faster , communicate differently .
and he said , &quot; well , okay . &quot;
and so there are some psychological effects that happen with this .
imagine telling someone that you meet today what you &apos;re going to do .
derek sivers : keep your goals to yourself
they take more risks than children or adults , and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they &apos;re with their friends . there &apos;s an important drive to become independent from one &apos;s parents and to impress one &apos;s friends in adolescence .
they weren &apos;t in a and b at all ; they were completely new texts by archimedes , and they were called &quot; the method &quot; and &quot; the stomachion . &quot;
and so before we could start imaging archimedes , we had to take this book apart .
if you process the same two images in a different way , you can actually get rid of the prayer book text .
so what did we discover ?
so this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity , speaking to us , not from the grave , because his grave doesn &apos;t exist , but from the athenian law courts .
because they already know what she looks like .
i became increasingly , kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know , why do people spend these crazy amounts of money , not only on wine but on lots of things , and are they living a better life than me ?
it &apos;s in the smell .
they are made from handpicked organic zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times .
unrelatedly -- japan is doing crazy things with toilets .
this was a fun one .
i &apos;d put out feelers to retailers , to auctioneers , and it was coming up empty .
can happiness be bought ? to find out , author benjamin wallace sampled the world &apos;s most expensive products , including a bottle of 1947 chateau cheval blanc , 8 ounces of kobe beef and the fabled kopi luwak coffee . his critique may surprise you .
now if we look at what &apos;s going on in someone &apos;s head when they are being engaged , two quite different processes are occurring .
simple game quest .
and also , we say , &quot; well , how many monsters ? should i have the entire world full of a billion monsters ? &quot;
and everything comes towards that , and they watch it creeping up , and they own that as it goes along .
and two things really flow from this .
i mean , we &apos;re beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation .
mummies are a great source of information , except that they &apos;re really geographically limited and limited in time as well .
and actually , lo and behold , it looks pretty much like the areas of the world that are hungry are also the areas of the world that are pretty insecure .
it &apos;s actually been spreading all around the world and mainly through our kind of food systems that we &apos;re exporting .
unfortunately , what is farmed ends up as what we eat .
and so in my lifetime , a lot of what &apos;s happened in the world -- and being a person obsessed with food -- a lot of this has really changed .
here &apos;s the go-kart that we built together .
but we also allowed , set up some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely , and if you water it a few times , we &apos;d give you your own seed to plant .
we were totally surprised .
so here &apos;s an example . i &apos;ll use a figure eight , tracing out a figure eight as an example .
and now i get to teach her how things work , and we get to build projects together , and i wonder what kind of lessons that she &apos;ll learn from them .
so , as the president now reassures us , we are on track to achieve our goals .
but when we began to bring more money , when we began to invest more resources , things got worse , not better . how ?
andrew wilder , for example , born on the pakistan-iranian border , served his whole life in pakistan and afghanistan .
we need to somehow get their message to the policymakers .
this has been done by an incredible , principled effort by the international community , and , of course , above all , by bosnians themselves .
because the worst thing we have done in afghanistan is this idea that failure is not an option .
british mp rory stewart walked across afghanistan after 9 / 11 , talking with citizens and warlords alike . now , a decade later , he asks : why are western and coalition forces still fighting there ? he shares lessons from past military interventions that worked -- bosnia , for instance -- and shows that humility and local expertise are the keys to success .
your brain works exactly the same way , responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal .
children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging .
give yourself permission to eat as much as you want , and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel good .
in the us , 80 % of girls have been on a diet by the time they &apos;re 10 years old . in this honest , raw talk , neuroscientist sandra aamodt uses her personal story to frame an important lesson about how our brains manage our bodies , as she explores the science behind why dieting not only doesn &apos;t work , but is likely to do more harm than good . she suggests ideas for how to live a less diet-obsessed life , intuitively .
in fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa , we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others .
solly remained on the bank .
he comes straight into the channel .
and yet , for the next five years she returned in the winter months .
pat mitchell : so boyd , we know that you knew president mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today , and deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world .
our friends think we &apos;re mad .
i was so inspired .
did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity ?
i want you to know that i believe kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food if they know more about it and where it really comes from .
and i &apos;ll just give you one example . i had gotten my first walkman .
it has gotten to the point where , you know , within advertising or within the movie industry , &quot; happy &quot; has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic , you almost would have to , you know , do it from a cynical point of view .
but my last project is , again , from a young designer in new york .
again , we could supply the content for it .
throughout all of history , if you wanted something written , a report or an article , you had to involve a person .
now — — as a white guy who spent his whole career at mit and harvard , i got no problem with this .
and the colors here represent the motivation behind the money .
let &apos;s take a look .
and there &apos;s another pattern here as well . can you spot it ?
so there &apos;s a titanic amount of data out there now , unprecedented .
then you have touch , which is about the speed of a usb key .
who has the biggest budget as a proportion of gdp ?
and the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to google hits .
what i love about this image is it &apos;s made up of concepts , it explores our worldviews and it helps us -- it helps me anyway -- to see what others think , to see where they &apos;re coming from .
and what is interesting is that often , even if we &apos;re in the 21st century , we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state .
and so to think again , there &apos;s no reason that you should believe me , so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on , but you might want to take it out , your iphone .
and so this whole notion -- i mean , this is the point , right ?
it really was . i mean , the probability of failure was massive .
why doesn &apos;t the government just get out of the way and let the private sector -- the &quot; real revolutionaries &quot; -- innovate ? it &apos;s rhetoric you hear everywhere , and mariana mazzucato wants to dispel it . in an energetic talk , she shows how the state -- which many see as a slow , hunkering behemoth -- is really one of our most exciting risk-takers and market-shapers .
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
what &apos;s more likely -- that arnold had a little extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship ?
so he wrote that he had seen -- &quot; i have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies . &quot;
little froggy legs .
it &apos;s getting the dead to talk back that &apos;s the really hard part .
and so , he wrote an op-ed piece in &quot; the guardian &quot; about katie &apos;s song , in which he said , well , we know exactly how old , how far from the edge .
working with the harvard business school , you &apos;ll see this example when you talk about minimum payment : if you spent 62 dollars for a meal , the longer you take to pay out that loan , you see , over a period of time using the minimum payment it &apos;s 99 dollars and 17 cents .
we see all this complexity .
stop wringing your hands over aids , cancer and the avian flu . cardiovascular disease kills more people than everything else combined -- and it &apos;s mostly preventable . dr. dean ornish explains how changing our eating habits will save lives .
what happened then is a direct reflection of what is happening now . everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by god and by the state for the big society , fast-tracking adoption .
they sat me at a table , my foster mom , and she said to me , &quot; you don &apos;t love us , do you ? &quot; at 11 years old .
i &apos;m just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is , a mother , a father , a sister , a brother , an aunt , an uncle , a cousin , a grandparent . it matters to someone , and therefore it matters to you . understand , i was 14 years old , tucked away in myself , into myself , and i wasn &apos;t touched either , physically touched .
and you know something about a lousy school ?
they might like that . what about a saturday ?
why did we ever do it ?
poor people don &apos;t know , and we &apos;re not doing anything to help them at all .
they &apos;ll tell you raheem really struggled , couldn &apos;t do two-digit multiplication -- so great data , but you &apos;re getting it back after school is over .
so here &apos;s the other issue that i just think we &apos;ve got to be concerned about .
so that we have to do . but this innovation issue , this idea that we &apos;ve got to keep innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical .
and so we &apos;ve figured out that you &apos;ve got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does .
and i thought to myself , wouldn &apos;t it be great if i had my own dodo skeleton ?
and over a few hours , i eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull . and i didn &apos;t mean to continue , i -- it &apos;s kind of like , you know , you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time ; you can &apos;t think about the totality .
built out of words , it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie , in which another object is created : a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett created out of words , inspired by the kniphausen hawk , and this represents the falcon in the movie .
i ended up with this : my maltese falcon .
but there &apos;s a problem .
and it &apos;s important to remember that , because the bonobos are so human , and they share 99 percent of their genes with us .
it essentially runs up from the gulf of aden , or runs down to lake malawi .
but when i was 12 , as i was in this picture , a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side , when they found essentially the skeleton of this homo erectus .
we &apos;re certainly a polluting , wasteful , aggressive species , with a few nice things thrown in , perhaps .
we &apos;re sitting on the edge of a precipice , and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today .
i &apos;ve seen this firsthand over and over again .
and then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem .
i was having a really bad day .
you &apos;re what we call a partial paraplegic , and you &apos;ll have all of the injuries that go along with that .
i remember dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair , wrapped in a plaster body cast , and feeling the sun on my face for the first time .
she was always happy , and even when she began to talk again , albeit difficult to understand , she never complained , not once .
i made a booking , and weeks later my friend chris and my mom drove me out to the airport , all 80 pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls .
and i took the controls , and i was flying .
i now know that my real strength never came from my body , and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically , who i am is unchanged .
the building was a true bird-killer .
so after six years , my friends and colleagues urged me to publish , so i published &quot; the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard . &quot;
yeah ?
and here you see a dead duck .
one afternoon , kees moeliker got a research opportunity few ornithologists would wish for : a flying duck slammed into his glass office building , died , and then … what happened next would change his life . &#91; note : contains graphic images and descriptions of sexual behavior in animals . &#93;
so now that i &apos;d found a reliable protein i could detect , i then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein , and , thus , pancreatic cancer .
clearly , the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as i did .
so if a 15-year-old who didn &apos;t even know what a pancreas was could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer , just imagine what you could do .
and they look something like this .
and to my mind , those are pretty wise words , no matter what your creed . thank you .
especially the aisle with cleaning products .
so , also voices , i can transform speeches into color , for example , these are two very well-known speeches .
so i travel the globe , and what i &apos;m noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered , there seems to be a crisis of desire .
in desire , we want an other , somebody on the other side that we can go visit , that we can go spend some time with , that we can go see what goes on in their red light district .
wanting them is one thing . needing them is a shutdown , and women have known that forever , because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge .
so when i began to think about eroticism , i began to think about the poetics of sex , and if i look at it as an intelligence , then it &apos;s something that you cultivate .
our need for connection , our need for separateness , or our need for security and adventure , or our need for togetherness and for autonomy , and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable , and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore .
so in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs , there are a few things that i &apos;ve come to understand erotic couples do .
&quot; by talking heads ) so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood .
and it would be a mess in a context like this . this is a gothic cathedral .
the halls got bigger . carnegie hall &apos;s fair-sized .
so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that .
live performance , when it was incredibly successful , ended up in what is probably , acoustically , the worst sounding venues on the planet : sports stadiums , basketball arenas and hockey arenas .
and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .
he did after all have a toy gun .
if you look at it as a brand in those ways , what you &apos;ll come to realize is , it &apos;s a pretty flawed product .
that &apos;s where their consumers come from .
there &apos;s a very young , attractive lady over here , and she has something which i think &apos;s the worst form of psychological , physical injury i &apos;ve ever seen out of a suicide bombing : it &apos;s human shrapnel .
if we look at al qaeda . al qaeda was essentially a product on a shelf in a souk somewhere which not many people had heard of .
these initiatives cost less than a missile , and certainly less than any soldier &apos;s life , but more importantly , it takes the war to their homelands , and not onto our shore , and we &apos;re looking at the causes .
in this gripping talk , lawyer jason mccue urges for a new way to attack terrorism , to weaken its credibility with those who are buying the product -- the recruits . he shares stories of real cases where he and other activists used this approach to engage and create change .
he said , &quot; your sermons have certainly helped me . &quot;
the first one that david saw was human evil .
but he made this statement .
i remember once , i sat beside mrs. gorbachev at a white house dinner .
the final problem that david knew he could not solve was death .
i talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor .
blaise pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth-century france .
when i was 17 years of age , i was born and reared on a farm in north carolina .
so we call this anatomage table .
so let me show you , i &apos;m going to start with the skeletal structure , and i can add a few internal organs .
after this , they were scientists , professionals with a particular scientific method , goals , societies and funding .
the philosophical breakfast club changed that , working together .
&#91; external funding for science &#93; up to the 19th century , natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies .
no , no , i wasn &apos;t 14 years old .
it &apos;s actually not life , it &apos;s a crystal .
and this was steen rasmussen .
and the thing i came up with -- i have to first give you an introduction about the idea , and maybe that would be a meaning detector , rather than a life detector .
anywhere there &apos;s life , you &apos;re going to have this distribution , as opposed to that distribution .
what do we learn from that ?
i will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
so i am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
one woman loses her head .
if you must , fear the unexploded .
the town had a vermiculite mine in it .
you have chosen not to know .
and the recurrent theme that i encounter all the time is people say , &quot; well , you know , the people who do see , they &apos;re whistleblowers , and we all know what happens to them . &quot;
when i went to libby , montana , i visited the asbestosis clinic that gayla benefield brought into being , a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went in the back door because they didn &apos;t want to acknowledge that she &apos;d been right .
the women &apos;s chief of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dirty .
one of the things that happens is that she applies for a scholarship .
one day she said to me , &quot; my wish is to finish college and be able to support my children . &quot;
she went to school .
lg : i can tell you many hopeful things that i &apos;ve seen happening .
but here we are , 20 years on , and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the ipad , not hal .
when you put it all together , it &apos;s quite a computational challenge : 3,500 victims , 1,800 adjacency requests , the importance of the overall physical specifications and the final aesthetics .
instead , people will have to look at data and search for insight , and as licklider foresaw long ago , the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation , and as kasparov realized , that means minimizing friction at the interface .
the other picture is the popularity of the real need for change .
n well , let me first warn you that i &apos;m not the traditional yemeni girl .
it was very hard , you know , to impose my authority .
so the other face of yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil , and it &apos;s economic empowerment mostly that allows the woman to just uncover it .
and this is probably something i &apos;m going to share with you in western media probably -- and how there &apos;s a lot of stereotypes -- thinking of yemen in one single frame : this is what yemen is all about .
so i wish that the world would know my yemen , my country , my people .
i couldn &apos;t walk as much as i used to , so i opted for five-inch heels .
my fingers started turning blue , and i was like , &quot; what is going on here ? &quot;
but the next morning , while i was still in the hospital , i got a telephone call .
and i &apos;m so grateful they did .
interestingly , one of those birth defects has seen a 200 percent increase in the u.s .
now what &apos;s interesting is , of course , that we &apos;re still using 80 million pounds of atrazine , the number one contaminant in drinking water , that does the opposite -- turns on aromatase , increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with tumors , breast cancer , in humans .
of those that don &apos;t abort , atrazine causes impaired mammary , or breast , development in the exposed daughters in utero , so that their breast don &apos;t develop properly .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s just profound and sad , but astonishing because so many of us don &apos;t actually know this .
and my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that it &apos;s not just about melting glaciers and ice caps , but it &apos;s also about our children as well .
when she came into my life , we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the east river waterfront , despite the fact that our small part of new york city already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city &apos;s commercial waste : a sewage treatment pelletizing plant , a sewage sludge plant , four power plants , the world &apos;s largest food distribution center , as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week .
our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average .
red-lining was used by banks , wherein certain sections of the city , including ours , were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment .
physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety , the placement of the waste and other facilities , which , if done properly , don &apos;t compromise a community &apos;s quality of life .
anyway -- ok . katrina . prior to katrina , the south bronx and new orleans &apos; ninth ward had a lot in common . both were largely populated by poor people of color , both hotbeds of cultural innovation : think hip-hop and jazz .
now let &apos;s get this straight . i am not anti-development .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here and why you value the information we exchange .
things are changing and today , on the united nations statistic division home page , it says , by first of may , full access to the databases .
now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world ?
we have a function here -- i can tell the world , &quot; stay where you are . &quot;
and i want to look at sweden and the united states .
it &apos;s interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub-saharan africa .
and everyone is responsible for the per capita emission . &quot;
we can get out of poverty .
and information will tell her when to go to market with which product .
or if you are a teacher , you &apos;ll love unesco , and so on .
that &apos;s the value of living .
and the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom .
and that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs , or code .
and as i move my hand , i can pop the balloons or i can move the bug .
he took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish .
most people won &apos;t grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers , but those skills of thinking creatively , reasoning systematically , working collaboratively -- skills you develop when you code in scratch -- are things that people can use no matter what they &apos;re doing in their work lives .
plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal .
this is mae west , still alive at a zookeeper &apos;s home in new orleans .
now , you can buy certified organic produce .
the billboards say &quot; lab space available . &quot;
i have a small lab .
and in fact , this molecule prevents this adipocyte , this fat stem cell , from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet , like the folks in my hometown of chicago , fail to develop fatty liver , which is a major medical problem .
and the audience for such a long time was in a position where they didn &apos;t have any way of affecting news or making any change . they couldn &apos;t really connect .
more than three and a half thousand photos go up onto facebook .
and how do you build a list like that from scratch ?
but we started looking , and we used free internet tools to do so .
we looked at the curbs . the curbs were throwing shadows south , so we could tell the bridge was running east-west across the river .
they &apos;re yes or no , they &apos;re black or white .
traffic was horrific , and we were coming from when we got there , 20 minutes later , we started cpr on the kid .
when the ambulance arrived 15 minutes later , i gave them over a patient who was alive .
they ask me to meet . they wanted to meet with me .
but it could spread everywhere .
but we would also like to understand it .
there is something that made it that way .
it &apos;s not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a modern cosmologist , &quot; what are the problems we &apos;re trying to address ? &quot;
the amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same , even as the universe gets bigger and bigger .
it will probably increase , and the probability is enormously huge .
carl sagan once famously said that &quot; in order to make an apple pie , you must first invent the universe . &quot;
we will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes .
if that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much bigger multiverse .
i actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win .
that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers .
why should we believe what he &apos;s saying ? &quot;
we can get this information from the internet , from the economist , the financial times , the new york times , u.s. news and world report , lots of sources like that , or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems , because those experts know this information .
that &apos;s not going to be happening , but you can see that the line comes down faster if they &apos;re not put under international pressure , if they &apos;re allowed to pursue their own devices .
i would like to leave you with one thought , which is for me , the dominant theme of this gathering , and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world .
remember chris brown &apos;s video &quot; forever &quot; ?
we &apos;re watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides .
satawal is one half-mile long by one mile wide .
it &apos;s humanity &apos;s dna .
thank you . i have to tell you i &apos;m both challenged and excited .
what makes the difference in their performance ? &quot;
most of us don &apos;t do that , but the culture &apos;s a therapy culture .
audience : aye .
when a woman stands up and says , &quot; no , i won &apos;t go to the back of the bus , &quot; she didn &apos;t just affect her life . that decision shaped our culture .
you can get your desires or goals . how many have ever got a goal or desire and thought , is this all there is ?
you can do it by being more spiritual .
because we all know , corny as it sounds , the secret to living is giving . we all know life &apos;s not about me ; it &apos;s about we . this culture knows that . this room knows that .
i &apos;d say one of the parts of the map is like time . some people &apos;s idea of a long time is 100 years . somebody else &apos;s is three seconds , which is what i have .
all i can tell you is , i brought this man on stage with a man from new york who worked in the world trade center , because i had about 200 new yorkers there . more than 50 lost their entire companies , their friends , marking off their palm pilots -- one financial trader , this woman made of steel , bawling -- 30 friends crossing off that all died .
there was a story i wouldn &apos;t tell you then .
so i decided i would build one windmill for myself .
and , so now , when the polar ice caps melt , my recording studio will rise up like an ark , and i &apos;ll float off into the drowned world like a character from a j.g. ballard novel .
most of you might be aware that , in those days , the mouse used to come with a ball inside , and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving , and , accordingly , where the mouse is moving .
because pixels are actually , right now , confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets .
so , we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world .
when i come back to my desk i can just pinch that information back to my desktop so i can use my full-size computer .
so i &apos;m excited about how i can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment .
we really showed that , yes , we can .
so moving to our second commandment that i wanted to show you .
all the lines , the colored lines you see there , it &apos;s our high-capacity transportation network .
the second point i want to make about the favelas is , you &apos;ve got to open spaces in the favela .
it &apos;s what we call the operations center of rio .
osorio : absolutely , mr. mayor .
i try to figure out intellectually , philosophically , psychologically , what the experience of beauty is , what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it .
it &apos;s women who actually push history forward .
it was about problems with computer processing over the internet .
and all these photographs that i &apos;m showing , they were sent in by members .
and these clouds , these rarer clouds , remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday .
you know , when you &apos;re not dealing with the traditional pressures of earning a living and putting food on the table , raising a family , writing thank you letters , you have to now contend with answering a mountain of unanswered emails , updating a facebook page , feeding your twitter feed .
it was an absolutely amazing experience .
another device is called speedstrip .
this is an historic day in january .
there &apos;s many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality .
it was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although i did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
which i actually did , and which needless to say did not endear me to the faculty .
the voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it , and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when i realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly , and as such , it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care .
eleanor longden : the voices in my head
that &apos;s something we don &apos;t yet know how to do .
and then , when you shine sunlight at them , the sunlight will be reflected back , just as it is in the eyes of an animal .
it &apos;s really a huge challenge for us .
they would put up 25,000 images , they would go like this , &quot; 25,0000 , okay , okay .
so please go back home , tell your kids to play more games , because that &apos;s what i need .
now we have really made use of this , and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system .
and this is also again showing us what we can do .
so it gained some traction , and we &apos;re trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes , but also , perhaps in the future , in a more clinical situation .
he can go inside , push inside of the heart , and really feel how the valves are moving .
and then he &apos;s going backwards .
we can scan all sorts of things , all sorts of animals .
two years ago , on this very stage , we premiered virtual choir 2 , 2,052 singers from 58 different countries , this time performing a piece that i had written called &quot; sleep . &quot;
the uncomfortable fact is that actually almost everything that we call architecture today is actually the business of designing for about the richest one percent of the world &apos;s population , and it always has been .
but what if , actually , it &apos;s possible now for cities to be made not just by the few with a lot but also by the many with a bit ?
and it goes together without any bolts .
these are very , very small beginnings , and actually there &apos;s more people in the last week who have got in touch and they &apos;re not even on this map .
but , you know , the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper .
we had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world , like kilimanjaro , serengeti and the olduvai gorge .
&quot; everyone talks about the big bang . what banged ? &quot;
and in this scenario , not only was the big bang not the beginning , as you can see from the picture , it can happen over and over again .
here &apos;s the number of people in higher education .
the other thing that &apos;s happened , which was good for us , is the internet .
so here you can see behind this list .
he &apos;s about to finish his ph.d. , and he was filmed recently with someone you all know .
we want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers , as it does at aims .
and as a chemist , one of the things i wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is , could we make a really cool universal chemistry set ?
lee cronin : print your own medicine
this is also , i think , confirmed by the fact that the seclusion of women in creating a divided society is something that you also do not find in the koran , the very core of islam -- the divine core of islam that all muslims , and equally myself , believe .
the same thing can be said for honor killings , which is a recurrent theme in the western media -- and which is , of course , a horrible tradition .
but besides that , i also saw problems within islamic tradition .
he has a book , &quot; arabic thought in the liberal age , &quot; and the liberal age , he defines as 19th century and early 20th century .
turkey has never been colonized , so it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the ottoman empire .
of course , this is a long road .
so somehow it shows what &apos;s there .
but in another sense , it &apos;s an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe , and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe .
and since the mass determines the schwarzschild radius , there is actually only one thing i really need to know .
in fact , in a few examples it &apos;s like the ones that we &apos;re seeing here .
it &apos;s the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit .
with this technology all of a sudden you can see it .
so , we &apos;re cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume .
so , what do we see ?
and we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast , and holds a lot in store for the future .
so we started thinking about that , and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer .
so again we persisted , and foster &apos;s brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever sponsorship , and that was enough for me to quit my job , i did consulting on the side .
and for us , we have redefined charity .
he came up to me and said , &quot; thank you for starting movember . &quot;
yet , he was my greatest teacher .
so for example , in the 11th century , people liked pieces that ended like this .
and the how was harmony , stacking up the pitches to form chords .
i was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home , and i spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker .
and one day , a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record .
i &apos;m now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power by every child &apos;s favorite plaything .
and i think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things .
you know , a while after tedtalks started taking off , we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation .
so , it &apos;s easy to find the good stuff , and when you &apos;ve found it , you can watch it in close-up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it .
the wheel is turning .
and a global community of unicyclists discover each other online , inspire each other to greatness .
500 years ago , it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage .
but the good news is they are out there .
what &apos;s new -- and it &apos;s huge -- is that , for the first time , we get to see him , and he can see us .
how do i compose ?
i &apos;m not going to play my own composition today because , although i did finish it , it &apos;s way too long .
i only want to talk to those of you who want a great career .
i am normal . i &apos;m a nice , normal person , and nice , normal people don &apos;t have passion .
&quot; no . not exactly . &quot;
i want to be a great friend . i want to be a great spouse .
or , are you going to tell him this ?
power .
those are the kinds of things we can do with the data that we have .
leave him alone .
you were sleeping during that class .
it wouldn &apos;t be a matter of just opinion or just appearances .
it &apos;s just a matter of the consequences .
is it plato , is it aristotle , is it kant , is it mill ?
or now we have a few more choices .
it &apos;s based on norse legend .
it &apos;s an interesting story , i think .
but if you think about it , i would say that in the last twenty-five years , of every invention or innovation that &apos;s occurred in this country , the biggest one , in terms of impact on the well-being of people who live in the inner city , was crack cocaine .
so sudhir -- the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city -- dutifully took his clipboard and , you know , walked down to this housing project .
and they made them available to us .
so the same kids who are working in the gang were actually -- at a place like mcdonald &apos;s .
that makes you pause -- gives you some pause -- those of you who believe that a death penalty &apos;s going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime .
and they didn &apos;t really have gold jewelry -- they had gold-plated jewelry .
but we gotta be careful , because they can shoot around here , too , and then we all fucked . &quot;
but i grew up in canada , far from my arab roots .
it &apos;s a social citadel ; it &apos;s an impregnable fortress which resists any assault , any alternative .
they are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities , even their appearance .
even by educated people , who often feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do in their own tongue .
but at this critical moment in history , if we do not anchor freedom and justice , dignity and equality , privacy and autonomy in our personal lives , in our sexual lives , we will find it very hard to achieve in public life .
now , while ...
so , download it and have fun with it .
the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish , but it &apos;s because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it &apos;s being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape .
and someone asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
a simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control , then we went to a world of central control , and now we &apos;re in a world of people control .
that is already happened ; the information and internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways , but it hasn &apos;t , in every way , yet touched our government .
we &apos;re working with some of these people .
it measures neither our wit nor our courage , neither our wisdom nor our learning , neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country .
the u.s. is tied for 15th in reading , but we &apos;re 23rd in science and 31st in math .
a peer review day , and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays .
i &apos;ll see you later .
i &apos;ve been working on a project for the last six years adapting children &apos;s poetry to music .
and the burning question about alma-tadema was : did she marry ?
well , you &apos;ve been so ... that &apos;s innovative , don &apos;t you think ?
and i was like , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and we took these messages and we made posters out of it , because i know people : they don &apos;t read , they see images .
something crazy also happened .
and at some point , you become friends on facebook , and you become friends in life .
maybe as people , because especially in israel , we &apos;re in a democracy . we have the freedom of speech , and maybe that little thing can change something .
now , i know many people in this room and around the world will think , &quot; well actually , this is hard to grasp , &quot; because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct .
however , these two countries have the identical gini coefficient , perhaps what is more disturbing is that china &apos;s income equality has been improving in recent times , whereas that of the united states has been declining .
but it also says that as china moves toward being the largest economy in the world , something that is expected to happen by experts in 2016 , that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the west and the rest is likely to widen .
as you leave here today , i would like to leave you with a very personal message , which is what it is that i believe we should be doing as individuals , and this is really about being open-minded , open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world , creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people , has to be based in being open-minded , because these systems have good things and they have bad things .
there &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
the point that i would like to ask you to try to do , is just in 30 seconds -- and i know this is in a sense an impossible task -- write down what you think is probably some of the top priorities .
and that is what the copenhagen consensus is really trying to do -- to try to put prices on these issues .
i &apos;m going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects .
the fair projects -- notice i &apos;m not going to comment on all these -- but communicable diseases , scale of basic health services -- just made it , simply because , yes , scale of basic health services is a great thing .
one is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
but the point is to say , when we talk about saving people , or helping people in bangladesh in 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor bangladeshi .
if any one of you guys can talk bush into doing that , that &apos;s fine .
so i hope this will help us make better priorities , and think about how we better work for the world .
if you &apos;re old or young it doesn &apos;t really make a difference .
this is just completely ridiculous . &quot;
but also because the content was very close .
and the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid .
what i can &apos;t yet do is make it water-resistant .
this is one of the jackets you grew ?
then they teach us to do a suicide attack .
i want you to watch another excerpt from the film .
and i also reported that we &apos;d made this mind-blowing discovery -- this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole , consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane .
the impact was great .
if i say you have stolen , i show you the evidence that you have stolen .
aa that was my president .
you see , we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions .
thank you . stay safe .
they said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
when i was 15 , and i called my father to tell him that i had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
so this was a very large undertaking , and to do it we needed some help .
familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
another interesting thing that i learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is .
and what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed .
and i was embarrassed . i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for .
and he said there was coming soon , depending on the weather , but he &apos;d let me know when , and so with about four days notice , he said to go to this beach south of lisbon , and a little after 9 , this guy will walk out of the water .
the only question is , what was in the juice ?
immediately the bush administration military said ... what ?
that prisoner covered himself with shit every day , and they used to have to roll him in dirt so he wouldn &apos;t stink .
and it &apos;s a dynamic interplay .
he gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room .
and it &apos;s like a dial on human nature .
you could tell it wasn &apos;t a real jail .
diffusion of personal responsibility . blind obedience to authority .
that means that line is not out there .
most people are guilty of the evil of inaction , because your mother said , &quot; don &apos;t get involved . mind your own business . &quot;
so i want to thank you . thank you . thank you .
so in order to have a conscious mind , you have a self within the conscious mind .
i came to this because , if you &apos;re going to have a reference that we know as self -- the me , the i in our own processing -- we need to have something that is stable , something that does not deviate much from day to day .
another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species .
and i had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that i have .
and so she ultimately turned to prostitution .
and she said , &quot; what would i miss ?
my parents were radicals -- who became , well , grown-ups .
there are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness .
we are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing , community organizing , changing institutions from the inside out -- all continuing the incredible work that our mothers and grandmothers started .
i wrote about nia martin-robinson , the daughter of detroit and two civil rights activists , who &apos;s dedicating her life to environmental justice .
my mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory , or certainty , or security even .
by the way , the secret is not to go to sleep you might be sleep-deprived , but you &apos;ll finish your novel .
because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters .
the really strange part is that , at three and a half , just before i was going to school , my parents made a bizarre , unusual and incredibly brave decision .
and you know , disabled people are hugely educated .
and there &apos;s nothing wrong with my sense of smell .
he thought i was mad enough anyway .
and i kept thinking over and over in my mind , what had happened ? where did it go wrong ? why didn &apos;t i understand ?
and i grabbed this book off , and i &apos;m sitting on the couch going , &quot; i know what i &apos;m going to do .
and i wanted to make you see it in a positive way -- no charity , no pity .
losing of labels , because we are not jam jars .
my dream had been to convert solar energy at a very practical cost , but then i had this big detour .
a lot of people are working on things to try and reduce that , but i didn &apos;t have anything to contribute in that area .
so , about two and a half hours of the day we could collect with a stationary component .
but they &apos;re also very high pressure , so they &apos;re dangerous .
put a flame under it , the piston moves up .
it &apos;s just a small cylinder down here which holds the generator inside and all the linkage and it &apos;s the hot cap -- the hot cylinder on the top -- this part gets hot , this part is cool , and electricity comes out .
the hot water &apos;s optional .
it &apos;s just how many watts do you get per dollar , and how could you benefit from that using that power to change your life in some way .
thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great audience .
atmospheric explosions , or full combustion , takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car .
and when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule , they write one scientific paper on the subject .
you both have too much time on your hands and not much money .
i &apos;m probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax .
because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality , its duration , but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait .
so we walk out of the shops with one of each .
it could revolutionize the public services .
and it &apos;s vital we understand this .
td : but maybe in the spirit of appreciating the kindness of you all , i could share with you a little story about myself .
i talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone .
so , as we are climbing the tree , some of the things that we &apos;re doing are actually undermining the tree &apos;s very root .
so what can we do about that ? what can we say ?
this is the last cycle , and you can see it &apos;s pretty much figured out what its self looks like . and once it has a self-model , it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion .
and so i think we can roll the video that we have .
for the cassini mission .
but it doesn &apos;t just happen in the dry academic field of psychology .
so this is a drug called reboxetine , and this is a drug that i myself have prescribed . it &apos;s an antidepressant .
and yet , for some reason , if somebody conducts 10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want , we don &apos;t consider that to be research misconduct .
ben goldacre : what doctors don &apos;t know about the drugs they prescribe
&quot; i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people , so sometimes i didn &apos;t wear panties , and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself . &quot;
and he said , &quot; she read it once and then she read it again . &quot;
they said that by preserving those voices and sharing them , it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive .
and sometimes we make real plans .
so i &apos;ll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles .
one , two , three , four , five , six and seven .
he said , &quot; philippe , you have been had .
so i started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission .
so you don &apos;t want me to street juggle here , right ?
so i grab the dove , and for the second time i send her in the air .
inspiration .
but it ended up in this very long , protracted legal battle and there i was after five years fighting against parliament in front of three of britain &apos;s most eminent high court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not parliament had to release this data .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re starting to see more disclosure laws come out , so for example , on the environment , there &apos;s the aarhus convention , which is a european directive that gives people a very strong right to know , so if your water company is dumping water into your river , sewage water into your river , you have a right to know about it .
it &apos;s really difficult . so we &apos;re still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information , through leaks .
and humility because we are all human . we all make mistakes .
some fairy tales have happy endings . some don &apos;t .
and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it , instead of in brain research , towards diagnosing brain disorders in children .
so if i could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder , then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved .
he &apos;s like , &quot; is this still the rehearsal , or should i untie him ? &quot;
and the future self is not even around .
but despite my like for them , there &apos;s two nagging concerns that i &apos;ve always had about commitment devices , and you might feel this if you use them yourself .
that is to say , we somehow might not believe that we &apos;re going to get old , or we might not be able to imagine that we &apos;re going to get old some day .
so here i made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes , i show people what those outcomes will get you , in particular apartments that you can afford if you &apos;re retiring on 3,000 , 2,500 , 2,000 dollars per month and so on .
the older face is miserable .
now i know we learned that in math class , but now it &apos;s everywhere in the culture -- the x prize , the x-files , project x , tedx .
but now we have the answer to our question .
the world health organization estimates that there are nearly four to five hundred million people living on our tiny planet who are affected by a mental illness .
well today , i &apos;m very pleased to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade , and i want to share with you the findings of three particular such experiments , all three of which focused on depression , the most common of all mental illnesses .
nearly 450 million people are affected by mental illness worldwide . in wealthy nations , just half receive appropriate care , but in developing countries , close to 90 percent go untreated because psychiatrists are in such short supply . vikram patel outlines a highly promising approach -- training members of communities to give mental health interventions , empowering ordinary people to care for others .
thank you .
no matter what level you look at , whether it &apos;s at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level , we see the same problem again and again .
if you start green , it &apos;s like 80 to 100 percent .
if you drill water to make coke near a village farm , that &apos;s not illegal , but yes , it costs the community .
well i think we kind of did it at the same time , but he &apos;s done it .
we have the means already in our hands , through a structure , through a mechanism , called redd plus -- a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation .
it can &apos;t just be a giant sexist conspiracy .
&quot; what &apos;s it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school ?
girl 6 : like , if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy , you would think that girls &apos; games were kinda sissy .
rockett : who &apos;d want to show up at that party anyway ?
i &apos;m sure there are other people here who could tell you about the richard feynman they knew , and it would probably be a different richard feynman .
he loved to win .
and they were full of all kinds of jargon .
i also liked the kind of intellectual macho games .
i apologize for the sexist conversation here , but this is the way it really happened .
and it sort of worked , but it didn &apos;t work very well .
this was more or less known .
you just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons .
world war ii came to an end , and goering was captured , tried at nuremberg and ultimately sentenced to death .
he had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that .
some of you would eat it if it &apos;s beef , but not pork .
it will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are .
and in fact , there &apos;s a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people .
the philosopher denis dutton in his wonderful book &quot; the art instinct &quot; makes the case that , &quot; the value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation . &quot;
apparently to really enjoy the music of joshua bell , you have to know you &apos;re listening to joshua bell .
the pain gets less .
so we know that we need to start unpicking the science behind this .
you just go to the website , fill out the form , give them $ 60 , and it arrives in the post .
they are posh , they &apos;re wealthy , they &apos;re less likely to have outdoor jobs , they &apos;re less likely to do manual labor , they have better social support , they &apos;re less likely to smoke -- so for a whole host of fascinating , interlocking social , political and cultural reasons , they are less likely to have skin wrinkles .
they got older . we all develop over time .
you can give the competing drug in too high a dose , so that people get side effects .
so this is a graph of all of the trials that have been done on a particular treatment .
and this is not an isolated story .
i don &apos;t have children .
these mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity to play with it .
and throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill , so it &apos;s very good for that kind of whole-body training .
it &apos;s very safe actually .
from an economic point of view , this is good math , isn &apos;t it , that we should do this ?
an awful lot of kids , sorry , thank you — — one estimate in america currently is that something like 10 percent of kids , getting on that way , are being diagnosed with various conditions under the broad title of attention deficit disorder .
a friend of mine , an old friend -- actually very old , he &apos;s dead .
i mean , other animals may well have imaginations and creativity , but it &apos;s not so much in evidence , is it , as ours ?
now people always say , &quot; well , you know , you can &apos;t compare finland to america . &quot;
it &apos;s like education is an industrial process that can be improved just by having better data , and somewhere in , i think , the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we fine-tune it well enough , if we just get it right , it will all hum along perfectly into the future .
in the winter of 2004 , it rained in death valley .
how can i understand those invisible forces ? &quot;
i mean , come on , i &apos;m not going to turn down my thermostat .
that &apos;s what you want .
this is what you see .
and this man , he &apos;s every man -- your grandfather , your uncle , your father , your son , your neighbor , your professor , your student .
and you know that . americans don &apos;t read about this guy .
they &apos;re so evil , they &apos;re so mean -- this is what they &apos;re about . &quot;
that &apos;s what they are to you .
so i want you to go there .
can you feel their anger , their fear , their rage at what has happened in their country ?
listen to other people , enlighten ourselves .
china is the world &apos;s greatest anti-poverty program over the last three decades .
but the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people .
now we &apos;re not there yet .
in kurzweilian terms i &apos;m like the eeyore of economic growth .
but jefferson wasn &apos;t quite right , was he ?
i &apos;m not ready for joint replacement . &quot;
what we do is humanize the tissue .
this is an example of a real meteorite , and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth , and just how much of it survives and melts .
they got you out of purgatory faster .
part of the question that i have answered is , is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli : with human achievement , with history , with the things that drive us and make us human -- the passionate discovery , the bones of dinosaurs long gone , the maps of space that we &apos;ve experienced , and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination .
but i brought along here a lump of coal -- right here , one lump of coal .
so my best friends in life were the characters i read about in books .
and so these characters would become my friends .
and i thought , &quot; oh no . he thinks it &apos;s a note . &quot;
mark lynch , he &apos;s an amazing teacher and he &apos;s still a dear friend of mine , and i was 14 or 15 , and i walked into his comic book class halfway through the course , and i was so excited , i was beaming .
and he said , &quot; well , who pays you for that ? &quot;
and for him , it &apos;s only his second .
when jarrett j. krosoczka was a kid , he didn &apos;t play sports , but he &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; loved &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; art . he paints the funny and touching story of a little boy who pursued a simple passion : to draw and write stories . with the help of a supporting cast of family and teachers , our protagonist grew up to become the successful creator of beloved children &apos;s book characters , and a vocal advocate for arts education . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it &apos;s time to start designing for our ears .
that is not good for you .
what if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did , in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure , using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment ?
but what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us ?
and later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy , he pulled it out and said , &quot; and people at mit , they give out periodic tables . &quot;
i brought it here .
inspired by an abalone shell , angela belcher programs viruses to make elegant nanoscale structures that humans can use . selecting for high-performing genes through directed evolution , she &apos;s produced viruses that can construct powerful new batteries , clean hydrogen fuels and record-breaking solar cells . in her talk , she shows us how it &apos;s done . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
you decide when you want to be distracted by the tv .
you can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour .
they &apos;re now working on their ninth edition , which they began in 1930 , and they &apos;ve reached the letter p .
&quot; promise anything to her , &quot; &quot; promise her anything , &quot; and so on .
these are reminiscent of the kinds of categories that immanuel kant argued are the basic framework for human thought , and it &apos;s interesting that our unconscious use of language seems to reflect these kantian categories .
&quot; would you like to come up and see my etchings ? &quot;
the solution , i think , is that we use language at two levels : the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener , whereas the implicated content -- the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform -- allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context , which possibly initiates a changed relationship .
in an exclusive preview of his book &amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; the stuff of thought &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ; , steven pinker looks at language and how it expresses what goes on in our minds -- and how the words we choose communicate much more than we realize .
why do we try to convince other people to believe things that they don &apos;t want to believe ?
it is the dominant way of thinking about arguments .
great cognitive gain . okay . who won that argument ?
can you do that ? i think you can .
and she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women .
the biases , whether intentional or otherwise , are pervasive , and so are the misleading mental images .
and that &apos;s just to start .
and when i was applying to business school and felt certain i couldn &apos;t do it and nobody i knew had done it , i went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact .
but then one author arrived , and he changed the game forever .
ipad storyteller joe sabia introduces us to lothar meggendorfer , who created a bold technology for storytelling : the pop-up book . sabia shows how new technology has always helped us tell our own stories , from the walls of caves to his own onstage ipad .
and when you &apos;re standing with someone , and you &apos;re on your mobile device , effectively what you &apos;re saying to them is , &quot; you are not as important as , literally , almost anything that could come to me through this device . &quot;
some of my favorite things , like chocolate and tea , blueberries , alcohol in moderation , stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana .
thank you .
why ?
and we certainly don &apos;t have any empathy for that part -- which explains the third consistent component of regret , which is an intense desire to punish ourselves .
because it &apos;s actually not that hideous .
but can i use a paper towel ?
and so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and i &apos;m going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we &apos;re doing on the bottom .
now , i probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient , and in that case , it would take me more about 20 years to break even .
cynthia and i were there .
they know they can control their world .
but more than that , people are building green houses around green school , so their kids can walk to school on the paths .
when i see them together , i know that they &apos;re working out how to live in the future .
when the architects came , they brought us these things , and you &apos;ve probably seen things like this .
for most of my life , i never gave a second thought to my ability to speak .
chaz told me that if that song hadn &apos;t played for so long , i might have already been in the car , on the way home , and would have died right there and then .
how does that affect who you are as a person ?
roger 2.0 : oprah , i can &apos;t tell you how great it is to be back on your show .
john hunter : all my life i was a motormouth .
i was in line at radio shack to buy one of the first model 100 &apos;s .
this whole adventure has been a learning experience .
i have much to make me happy and relieved .
and it started , as with many great ideas , or many ideas you can &apos;t get rid of anyway , at a cocktail party .
it turns out that crows aren &apos;t just surviving with human beings -- they &apos;re actually really thriving .
yeah . all right .
joshua klein : yeah , yeah . pretty interesting .
then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut .
for example , why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events ?
i decided to be -- to work for them as an art director .
we treated two pages , both spreads , as a one page , because that &apos;s how readers perceive it .
the first lesson is about that design can change not just your product .
and electrolux was going to go to mexico .
in fact , there was a poll that was done recently and the pollster compared congress &apos;s approval ratings to a number of other unpleasant things , and it was found , in fact , that congress &apos;s approval rating is worse than cockroaches , lice , nickelback the band , root canals and donald trump .
but price to entry into that competition would be , you could just , say , use the president &apos;s goal .
what if we created a private sector challenge to the governors ?
and she said to them , &quot; vusi &apos;s here , and you &apos;re not going to take him tonight .
and i know all of you are scratching your head : &quot; a senior citizens &apos; home ? what in the world are you going to do there ? &quot;
so one day i was in my room and i saw this thing sitting in my room and i thought it was a monster .
but those categories mean even less now than they did before , because with online networking tools , it &apos;s much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes .
if the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media , then does that mean that women are going to take over global media ?
they are .
and so maybe i &apos;ll build a gilded cage .
a gold-plated , oversized key to the city and that is all i need , &apos; cause if i get that , i can unlock the air .
and i said to her , &quot; are you just doing this all the time ? &quot;
masters and johnson : now we &apos;re moving forward to the 1950s .
it all looks very innocent .
masters and johnson , in the 1950s , they decided , okay , we &apos;re going to figure out the entire human sexual response cycle , from arousal , all the way through orgasm , in men and women -- everything that happens in the human body .
the school where he graduated from with his master &apos;s had just offered him a teaching appointment , which meant not only a salary , but benefits for the first time in ages .
they just sort of give you your computer and then kick you out of the nest .
when i call you and leave a message on your voicemail , i hear you saying , &quot; leave a message , &quot; and then i get these 15 seconds of frickin &apos; instructions , like we haven &apos;t had answering machines for 45 years !
i &apos;ve just turned your $ 50 camera into a $ 1,000 camera with that trick .
but not to worry .
it &apos;s so much more subtle , so much more visceral -- you know , what &apos;s visible , what &apos;s not .
more boring , but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping .
so i decided to give him a little support , and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other .
and yeah , we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background .
or here , for example , we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve .
and it &apos;s not done , as many people imagine , with the computer , otherwise it would look like this .
i didn &apos;t have an exact address , but i knew his name , abed , i knew that he lived in a town of 15,000 , kfar kara , and i knew that , 21 years before , just outside this holy city , he broke my neck .
&quot; be careful , abed , look out . slow down . &quot;
was i what had been done to me ?
he led me to a house of cream stucco , then drove off .
and so i didn &apos;t point out that in his own testimony the morning after the crash , abed did not even mention the bus driver .
i forgot my discretion .
but most of all , i wished to tell him what herman melville wrote , that &quot; truly to enjoy bodily warmth , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast . &quot;
so the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines , and not just sentience , but empathy .
which was the basis of the movie &quot; bladerunner . &quot;
now , i use my music to reach people &apos;s hearts and have found there are no boundaries .
or there &apos;s the same thing , but recycled paper , you have to get five of those because they &apos;re not as absorbant , of course .
it &apos;s way too big a towel .
but i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth , and it &apos;s with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math -- not just financial math , but math in general .
and i said , &quot; how does that work ? &quot;
you can find these kinds of things wherever you look , once you learn how to look for them .
and what you see here , or what you don &apos;t really see normally , is that these are the physics of culture .
because the algorithms of wall street are dependent on one quality above all else , which is speed .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do : we &apos;ll build bubbles or something , or platforms .
and yet , i &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own .
so having seen this danger to the economy , i thought , we need to find a solution to this problem .
the challenge here is , if i try to systematically do this , i would probably end up with a lot of summaries , but not with many friends in the end .
here are some of my favorites .
sebastian wernicke : 1000 tedtalks , 6 words
in fact , if we look at the genetic code , it &apos;s the only disease we can see that people who lived in africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths .
now , malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos .
because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things .
and we have to change this .
what does that mean ?
there are some people who are very good at this .
how does that compare to a normal school ?
and so by thinking of this as a personnel system , we can do it much better .
in part two , i &apos;ll offer a solution to that mystery .
so , what to do ?
it appears that it may not always be that way .
so , unsignalized intersections , meaning stop signs , they save many lives , but there &apos;s an excessive proliferation of them .
because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they &apos;re waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren &apos;t slowing down on the main road .
we &apos;ve made into something beyond us .
i knew that i was where i was supposed to be , and i knew that i was home , and i haven &apos;t spoken to you once in the four years since that day , but i heard that you were leaving , and i had to come up and tell you that you &apos;ve been an incredibly important person in my life , and i &apos;m going to miss you . good luck . &quot;
and it &apos;s a simple idea , but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a small one , and i want to thank you all so much for letting me share it with you today .
and when you &apos;re outdoors , that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt .
as just a second example : these pyramidal cells , large cells , they can span a significant fraction of the brain .
so when i started in neuroscience 11 years ago , i had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist , and the first thing i thought about was , if these neurons are electrical devices , all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance .
the neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell , like putting solar panels on a roof , and the next thing you know , you have a neuron which can be activated with light .
now we &apos;ve shown that a brief activation of these is enough , indeed , to drive learning .
and we &apos;ve now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -- every kingdom of life except for animals , we see slightly differently .
and the retina , of course , is a complex structure .
light is converted to electricity on them .
je : well , that might change a couple things . thank you .
martha gellhorn , who &apos;s one of my heroes , once said , &quot; you can only love one war . the rest is responsibility . &quot;
there was a group of children , mixed hutus and tutsis , and a group of women who were adopting them , and they lined up and one was just given to the next .
and that &apos;s what i try to do .
if you turn it off , that &apos;s called a coma , okay ?
okay . what i want you to do is i want you to tell me what the answer is to 23 times eight .
now , a central issue with working memory is that it &apos;s limited .
do i agree with the assumptions ?
and the last one is support .
they have a hut that has no electricity , no running water , no wristwatch , no bicycle .
and over the years , as we followed dai manju , we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle .
sometimes it &apos;s also because of the sonogram .
however , two-thirds of the way there was a barrier .
it &apos;s a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent .
with economic opportunity , it can be transformative .
her parents , again , said , &quot; why should we spend the money on her ?
when i was in zimbabwe , we were touring a place with the village chief -- he wanted to raise money for a secondary school -- and there was some construction a few yards away , and i said , &quot; what &apos;s that ? &quot;
and she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility .
and all of this from a puff of air emanating from our mouths .
okay , so what this tells us is that , contrary to the old adage , &quot; monkey see , monkey do , &quot; the surprise really is that all of the other animals really cannot do that -- at least not very much .
and we really had only two options for dealing with the conflicts that visual theft would bring .
okay , now replay this scene now , and you &apos;re approaching the one who has language .
now , incredible as this sounds , i once met a papuan man , and i asked him if this could possibly be true .
the european union employs a permanent staff of about 2,500 translators .
mark pagel : how language transformed humanity
right ?
so what do we actually know about the leaks ?
when your data traffic goes through sweden , their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic .
feel free to survey me if that helps .
so we are back to the age of colonization , and we , the foreign users of the internet , we should think about americans as our masters .
before that time , people are left to their own devices .
thank you .
and i mention this because there &apos;s this strange public perception that nasa &apos;s dead , that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there &apos;s no more spacecraft out there .
there &apos;s a whole story to tell here .
this is the area where primary auditory processing -- so you &apos;re hearing my words , you &apos;re sending it up into higher language processing centers .
these are support cells -- astrocytes glia .
males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life .
this will then go onto a robot that &apos;s going to apply one of those stains to it .
it &apos;s basically a large data set of information that &apos;s all freely available to any scientist around the world .
so now we can look throughout the brain .
these are two genes that we found as good examples .
imagine you have a few million dollars that you &apos;ve raised -- maybe you &apos;re a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend . you want to spend it on the poor : how do you go about it ?
we don &apos;t know .
but how do you do that ?
but maybe there is another problem as well .
so here you &apos;ve got your answer .
second thing is , how about the use ?
in technology , we spend so much time experimenting , fine-tuning , getting the absolute cheapest way to do something , so why aren &apos;t we doing that with social policy ?
so , why is that ?
so it &apos;s a slow process , but there is no other way .
and if you compare light energy to musical scales , it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see , which is right in the middle ?
nature &apos;s beauty can be easily missed -- but not through louie schwartzberg &apos;s lens . his stunning time-lapse photography , accompanied by powerful words from benedictine monk brother david steindl-rast , serves as a meditation on being grateful for every day . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
very , very simple .
they have a skill , which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid .
an animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent , so it goes extremely fast .
and to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable work .
for example , if i do that , and reach and grab an apple , a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire .
a polar bear , to evolve a coat , will take thousands of generations , maybe 100,000 years .
you &apos;ve dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
it felt a bit girly to me , like a dress , and it had this baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down .
it didn &apos;t look indian anymore .
how do we decide who we are ? hetain patel &apos;s surprising performance plays with identity , language and accent -- and challenges you to think deeper than surface appearances . a delightful meditation on self , with performer yuyu rau , and inspired by bruce lee .
so you start to hear these abusive voices , but you don &apos;t hear one abusive voice , you hear about a thousand -- 100,000 abusive voices , like if the devil had tourette &apos;s , that &apos;s what it would sound like .
evolution did not prepare us for this . we just don &apos;t have the bandwidth , and for people who say , oh , they &apos;re having a nice day , they &apos;re perfectly fine , they &apos;re more insane than the rest of us .
i want everybody to put out your hands like this for me , first of all .
keith barry : kathryn , it &apos;s keith here . i &apos;m going to take you to a secret location , ok ?
kt : no , no , no , no .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
ok , that was a pity . i would have told them it was the ace of spades .
nicole : yes .
kb : hold it right there .
but it &apos;s ok that even though you &apos;re not hypnotized , you will forget everything that happened .
excellent .
nicole : mm-hmm .
kb : no one in the audience . and just to help you out , i &apos;ll block them from view , so nobody can see what you &apos;re doing .
ok , go ahead , mix them up .
kb : good decision .
i want to know if there &apos;s a chemistry of morality .
so taking on morality with a capital m is a huge project .
and now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger ?
so i tend to avoid that .
get yourself a fat reward . life &apos;s good . &quot;
there &apos;s another way oxytocin is inhibited , which is interesting -- through the action of testosterone .
then the groom &apos;s father , then the groom , then the family , then the friends -- arrayed around the bride like planets around the sun .
i know how to do it , and my favorite way to do it is , in fact , the easiest .
the little hole in the middle , we &apos;ll come to a bit later , but that &apos;s for the pollen tube to come out later on . a very tiny tube .
now , those little barbs obviously stick to the insects well , but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph , and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line across what would be the equator of this , if it was the earth .
so , you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer or so , where that piece of clothing has been recently and then send in dogs .
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive .
what does this mean for us ?
the schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine .
well , i bumped into this whole thing completely by accident .
and they said something very interesting to me .
i made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
could it be that we don &apos;t need to go to school at all ?
i got 200 in the first two weeks .
and i said , &quot; yeah , it happens by itself . &quot; &quot; how did you know that ? &quot;
it will be called the school in the cloud .
and on this day , at this moment , we walked into the house with our first child , our beautiful baby boy .
baby : gagagagagaga gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water .
this is a moment , one moment captured across multiple cameras .
this is the wordscape for the word water , and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen .
and so fundamentally , rather than , for example , measuring content based on how many people are watching , this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content .
a nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what &apos;s on the broadcast .
can you do it ?
it &apos;s on this side of the brain .
and so we can compare and contrast the big ideas .
and this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible .
it was invented around the 1920s , and the inventor , léon theremin -- he also was a musician besides an inventor -- he came up with the idea for making the theremin , i think , when he was working on some shortwave radios .
this is the first house i built .
then , this faucet here is just a piece of osage orange .
this light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in america .
if i can repeat anything , i have the possibility of a pattern from hickory nuts and chicken eggs , shards of glass , branches .
&quot; oh , i &apos;m so sorry , sir . we &apos;ll get you a straight one . &quot;
it &apos;s a chattel mortgage , just like furniture , just like a car .
it &apos;s a pretty quick read .
see , i &apos;m one of the beautiful people . see my jeans ? &quot;
and i don &apos;t wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana , but we &apos;re clearly in trouble .
and if you look , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s only one way you can score three .
until it was stripped from me , i never thought about it .
it &apos;s the what our minds do every night to digest the day and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we &apos;re asleep to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning .
unlike the smashed glass of my car , plasticity of the brain means that there was always a possibility , with treatment , to train the brain so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness .
but they felt the evidences that there was important , valuable information in the book , and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it .
now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth and see the difference it makes .
so it goes in and it stays there .
and he was walking around .
the other things they &apos;ve worked on -- i didn &apos;t have time to say this in my talk -- is they &apos;ve restored functional hearing to thousands of deaf people .
each work that i make is comprised of three segments .
everyone showed up .
because the chimpanzee would score half right if i gave them two bananas with sri lanka and turkey . they would be right half of the cases .
all the green latin american countries are moving towards smaller families .
and we have most who lived in absolute poverty were asians .
chile will have a lower child mortality than cuba within some few years from now .
and even more policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing . now , why doesn &apos;t this take place ?
the income distribution of the united states , 1970 .
i was at the university of chicago , in my third year , and i was in my third year because the university of chicago let you in after two years of high school .
it wasn &apos;t going anywhere toward , you know , saying what the gene was ; it was just nuclear science . and oh , that &apos;s the book , little book .
the people from london came up .
and so bragg said , &quot; build models . &quot;
so in a sense , it is a sort of digital-type information .
and we knew , basically , dna provides the information for rna .
and the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it .
and if i had enough money , we &apos;d find them all this year .
with no employees .
well to sum up , it boils down to one thing : don &apos;t negotiate with terrorists .
&quot; let &apos;s have a dance , &quot; one girl shouted , and all the girls quickly backed her up .
i said , &quot; girls , well , well , you never know unless you ask . &quot;
because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought : what type of woman am i preparing to put in the world ?
the disease was so terrifying that the president of the united states launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it .
it &apos;s just happening in another part of the world .
and polio eradication , in many ways , is even tougher , and there &apos;s a few reasons for that .
and these heroes , they come from every walk of life , all sorts of backgrounds .
now as seductive as the idea of control sounds , it &apos;s a false premise .
and then they can track them , and at the end of the day , they look and see , did these guys get every single street , every single house .
ladies and gentlemen , with a combination of smart people , smart technology and smart investments , polio can now be eradicated anywhere .
so the tough ones : going to get the top of nigeria finished and getting pakistan finished .
because you know , when you look at a piece of music -- for example , if i just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here , hopefully , a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page .
however , that &apos;s just , you know , the initial idea i may have that we all get when we actually look , and we try to interpret , but actually it &apos;s so unbelievably shallow .
that of a difference . then gradually ... and gradually ...
if there were no resonators on here , we would have ...
we just -- we go like that , and we imagine that that &apos;s what deafness is about .
you know , the interesting thing here , though , is that i asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question .
single stroke rolls . so why can &apos;t i then do that whilst learning a piece of music ?
in this soaring demonstration , deaf percussionist evelyn glennie illustrates how listening to music involves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your eardrums .
we called her legadema , which means , &quot; light from the sky . &quot;
and 20 years ago , we did a film called &quot; eternal enemies &quot; where we managed to capture this unusual disturbing behavior across two species -- lions and hyenas .
everything has that will to survive , to fight , to push through that mental barrier and to keep going .
and over the next five hours , she took care of it .
south africa just released some lion bones onto the market .
beverly + dereck joubert : life lessons from big cats
your disability doesn &apos;t make you any less of a person , and neither does mine .
we &apos;re providing affordable , off-the-shelf robot platforms such as the a.r. drone , 300 dollars , the suitable technologies beam , only 17,000 dollars , along with open-source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we &apos;re trying to do .
it &apos;s just elementary probability theory .
he started walking . what am i mostly made of ? atoms .
but here is the bombshell : you weren &apos;t there .
perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals smell in color . and the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats .
i wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand , say , quantum theory , if we brought up children to play computer games , beginning in early childhood , which had a sort of make-believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen , a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computer &apos;s make-believe , so that they became familiar on the middle-world scale of the stream .
everything gives out some kind of data , whether it &apos;s sound or smell or vibration .
we can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature .
our political and military leaders were telling us one thing and photographers were telling us another .
in afghanistan , for example , we haven &apos;t just had one election or two elections . we &apos;ve gone through three elections , presidential and parliamentary . and what do we find ?
our societies have never been so educated , have never been so energized , have never been so healthy , have never known so much , cared so much , or wanted to do so much , and it is a genius of the local .
so what we see in the seventeenth , eighteenth century is the continued search for medications other than camphor that &apos;ll do the trick .
so people would have a real grand mal seizure .
i couldn &apos;t even pull the covers off myself .
all the senior staff got together , and i later found out what happened .
and he went back to them , and they agreed to do another 10 .
it &apos;s been , as i said , close to 30 years .
sherwin nuland : how electroshock therapy changed me
so no weapons , no speed , no strength , no fangs , no claws -- how were we killing these animals ? mystery number one .
you can &apos;t be hauling all your crap around , trying to chase the antelope .
and as a little girl , i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful , trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us , enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .
matt berlin : hello , leo .
the task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table , discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task -- this ended up being a survival task -- and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were .
and through this technology , being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren &apos;s lives in a way that &apos;s not possible today .
and the third was just a pen and paper log , because that &apos;s the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet-and-exercise program .
another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit more .
the recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do .
you can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light , and so we &apos;ve made optical fibers .
so , much like you &apos;re seen at night by a car , then the idea is that you can see , if you illuminate tissue , you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk .
fiorenzo omenetto : silk , the ancient material of the future
data : i find it incredibly educational .
and i can &apos;t have my posse laughin &apos; at me .
and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
i &apos;m so experienced that when you went to the fell school and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child in it , that was me , but kicked me out when i was caught teaching the fairy boys how to rob the pats off a pair of lee jeans and bring them to vim . let me see chekhov pull that off .
why not strangers ?
and yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat .
maria bezaitis : the surprising need for strangeness
so , i got working . i took some sheets of paper and started practicing , practicing , practicing , until i reached what i thought was a steady hand , and went into action .
and later , i told myself that one day i would have to question him .
but it was he who went to meet a man from the resistance .
and this is maybe what explains why , for 30 years , he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices .
and then , as he was a staunch anti-colonialist , he made false papers for algerians during the algerian war .
he was persuaded , and he &apos;s still convinced that another world is possible -- a world where no one would ever need a forger .
so what has now happened in the last few years is that there are account technologies around that allow you to see many , many pieces of dna very quickly .
&#91; they &apos;ve &#93; sequenced approximately equally &#91; as &#93; many people in europe and in china .
so an interesting question is , what happened when we met ?
so that today , the people living outside africa have about two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals .
so to sum up , what have we learned from studying genomes of present day humans and extinct humans ?
so our children are getting larger , but at the same time we are growing into different directions .
so this technology , 3d printing , and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight , which is the biggest issue in aircraft design , because it &apos;s directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions .
so there was a lot of meaning in my life because i was performing this type of research during the day .
and in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
and i &apos;m asking myself , &quot; what is wrong with me ?
and the next thing my brain says to me is , &quot; wow !
so he recognizes that i need help and he gets me help .
jill bolte taylor : my stroke of insight
then they go , &quot; outboard personnel , stand up . &quot;
so you look around , where you &apos;re going to land , you try to make yourself ready .
one of my first battalion commanders , i worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with lt. mcchrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march , and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds .
so we had to get complex intelligence together , we had to line up the ability to act .
i stood in front of a screen one night in iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces .
that was my journey .
and she pointed to the image on the right as an example , to me , of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media .
the space in which now , in my project of discovery , of thinking about artists , of trying to define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century .
and as many of us think about that continent and think about what if means to us all in the 21st century , i have begun that looking through artists , through artworks , and imagining what they can tell us about the future , what they tell us about our future , and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue .
in another south indian village , these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee .
boy : ... just mention , i play games like animals , and i listen to music .
they all came in there , and i told them that there &apos;s some really difficult stuff on this computer .
so i found that they had a friend , a local accountant , a young girl , and they played football with her .
the teachers said , &quot; is this deep learning ? &quot;
they wanted to be footballers before .
this sent shivers up my spine .
and i was in a village where there was an initiation ceremony for the young men , a rite of passage .
i start with the notion of the ideograph .
so i could go from -- for instance , i &apos;ll show you some &quot; spider-man &quot; later , these incredible machines that move people along .
and i , the king , shall love thee .
pp : be yourself and rise above it all . ensemble : sock ! pow ! slam ! scratch ! danny ezralow : i don &apos;t want you to even think there &apos;s a choreographer .
the wind was massively blowing , and the only way i could get to the other side was to look at the line straight in front of me .
you have to get away from verbal language .
now , maybe that &apos;s not true in this room , i see only specific pictures .
now , i had this brain scan done several years ago , and i used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex .
now , visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind .
people have a hard time figuring that out .
you know , one of the things that i think maybe ted ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on ted , and there &apos;s all kinds of great stuff on the internet to get these kids turned on .
i was taught that when i was very , very young .
because what i &apos;m observing is the good teachers , for a lot of these kids , are out in the community colleges , but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
but then you get the smart , geeky kids that have a touch of autism , and that &apos;s where you &apos;ve got to get them turned on with doing interesting things .
tg : well thank you so much . thank you .
come on .
that &apos;s twice as many numbers as words that each of us speaks in a lifetime .
and then we started looking at the data .
and coming home , my cofounder and i , we looked at it , and we said , there are two problems .
he &apos;s got a purpose . but he comes home &#91; to &#93; kansas city , missouri , maybe he goes to college , maybe he &apos;s got a job , but he doesn &apos;t have that same sense of purpose .
can you spot the vegetable ?
and the answer , i think , can be found in things like this .
but there was one programmer who decided that this wasn &apos;t the way to work .
it &apos;s an open-source programming language , and all of the interconnections between the people -- this is now not a software graph , but a people graph , all of the interconnections among the people working on that project — and this doesn &apos;t look like an org chart .
they are experimenting with openness .
now , when we first started talking to ok go -- the name of the song is &quot; this too shall pass &quot; -- we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with .
the machine itself would start the music .
but as much as the small stuff stinks , we needed somewhere to start , so that we would have somewhere to go .
we are ok go .
one that we &#91; see &#93; here , masaccio , the church of santa maria novella in florence , so we just said , well maybe , visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by leonardo , since he was a great admirer of leonardo da vinci .
well , the tablet . well , we thought , well , if we all have this pleasure , this privilege to see all this , to find all these discoveries , what about for everybody else ?
but what i &apos;m going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models .
it &apos;s a disease that runs in my family , and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure .
so we were pretty reassured by this .
we started physiotherapy , we started the rehabilitation , and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot .
and we thank you so much , all of you .
this disease appears first as tumors , usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected tasmanian devils .
paradoxically , once established , natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer .
we found that all of these cancers shared the same dna .
in fact , genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old , which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the neanderthals .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about optimism -- or more precisely , the optimism bias .
so to show you what i mean , i &apos;m going to do an experiment here with you .
so it &apos;s a very good theory , but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons .
we know that , because when you ask people about their ultimate favorite day of the week , surprise , surprise , saturday comes in at first , then friday , then sunday .
and then we told them the average likelihood of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes .
on the other side of the brain , the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news .
he says , &quot; fatality investigations for firefighters often include &apos; we didn &apos;t think the fire was going to do that , &apos; even when all of the available information was there to make safe decisions . &quot;
and basically , what i &apos;d like to tell you is that power is changing , and there are two types of changes i want to discuss .
if they have the price of entry into an internet cafe -- the last time i looked , it was something like a pound an hour -- and if you have skype , it &apos;s free .
but we need a new narrative if we &apos;re to understand power in the 21st century .
but be very careful about these projections such as the goldman sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture of power transition in this century .
let me give you an example from history .
it makes no sense to call this unipolar or multi-polar .
and if we &apos;re going to deal with these two great power shifts that i &apos;ve described , the power shift represented by transition among states , the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states , we &apos;re going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power .
that &apos;s the russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding arctic sea ice .
the stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest .
other examples to consider . in the u.k. , the thames barrier protects london from storm surge .
my poem is called &quot; dirt . &quot;
her five horrid , deformed little dogs who incessantly yap on the roof under my window .
it &apos;s called &quot; gas . &quot;
a casual impulse , a fancy , never thought of until now , hardly thought of even now ...
my passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds .
s : i don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
s : i want to speak perfect english .
in fact , they &apos;re so well-known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form .
news photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war : a little girl burned by napalm , a student killed by the national guard at kent state university in ohio during a protest .
here it is .
and the thing that fascinates me about the north pole , geographic north pole , is that it &apos;s slap bang in the middle of the sea .
the first one was reaching the pole itself .
i think the joke is that khatanga isn &apos;t the end of the world , but you can see it from there .
i knew this was happening . i knew the artic was warming .
stick a flag there , leave it there , pretty soon it will drift off , usually towards canada or greenland .
we &apos;d like to pick you up .
rammed it forwards . bounced down the runway . just took off .
there was a tent , a letter to the norwegian king .
why is this old table in your office ? &quot;
her answer set the template for the entire career i was to have after that .
and i have that kind of flash sometimes .
i wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
and they &apos;ve done it several times too .
well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
she was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
but now i &apos;m feeling really weird because i &apos;m living what sun tzu said one week .
i &apos;ve failed them .
john hunter puts all the problems of the world on a 4&apos;x5 &apos; plywood board -- and lets his 4th-graders solve them . at ted2011 , he explains how his world peace game engages schoolkids , and why the complex lessons it teaches -- spontaneous , and always surprising -- go further than classroom lectures can .
but i decided not to have this treatment .
the first one is that in life we encounter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our faces .
it was a very revolutionary time .
and one thing which i found was this black rubber .
because if they put tiles on top , it &apos;s just going to crash .
now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon .
but this is great fun for children .
i just put this inside this .
so something which is trash , which is choking all the seabirds , you could just recycle this into a very , very joyous -- all the platonic solids can be made with things like this .
you can see , this is the generator . it &apos;s a crank generator .
this is called &quot; the captain &apos;s hat story . &quot;
thank you so much .
and , you know , you can &apos;t fault him for accuracy .
because your choice now is either i use my own needle now , or i could share a needle now and get a disease that &apos;s going to possibly kill me 10 years from now , or i could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow .
except that , wait a minute , politicians are rational , too , and they &apos;re responding to what they think the voters want .
and you &apos;ll note , that &apos;s the local data from los angeles : 25 percent prevalence among gay men .
of course not , of course not .
why does she do that job ?
elizabeth pisani : sex , drugs and hiv -- let &apos;s get rational
it was a hell of a challenge , and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues .
and in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food , cardboard and plastic waste .
and during the evolution of life on the earth , it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy .
so it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land -- and in that sense , going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design .
so after a while , we could take that out , use it as a lightweight building block .
i was covering the war in afghanistan , and i witnessed , as a reporter for al jazeera , the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that .
al-qaeda is taking over our territories .
she was always saying things that made me stop and think , like , &quot; time may be a great healer , but it ain &apos;t no beauty specialist . &quot;
hey , hey black-eyed susie , hey .
those last few pictures were of ray hicks , who just passed away last year .
my mom was driving ; my brother and i were in the back seat .
well , the foreman could see he was in over his head , i guess .
try this old song with me . i sing : well , there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
fifteen years ago , 14 years ago , i guess , this year , my wife and i lost our daughter , sarah jane , in a car accident , and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world .
call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues .
we tore everything down and buried it in his backyard .
i showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday ; i &apos;m going to be doing some of the same ones .
i &apos;m looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36 , which was only four percent of the population , so now i &apos;m dealing with the possibility of 30,000 men .
the algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets , we share a love of math and data and &apos; 80s music , and so i agreed to go out with him .
i &apos;m going to keep using these online dating sites , but i &apos;m going to treat them as databases , and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up , i think i &apos;m going to try reverse-engineering this entire system .
at this moment i knew , clicking after profile after profile after profile that looked like this , that i needed to do some market research .
and as it turns out , lots and lots of men wanted to date me .
amy webb : how i hacked online dating
and this is only done in four hours , 50 times faster than the current state of the art , at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options .
so let &apos;s try changing the rule for this program a little bit .
it doesn &apos;t take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation ; just something that happens , naturally , all over the place .
so let &apos;s try asking a question , like a health related question .
so , i &apos;m pretty pleased with it all .
then , the idea is that wolfram alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they &apos;re asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger , precise programs .
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid .
are you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe ?
but in any case , what i &apos;m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about .
and they were very closely associated .
they &apos;re thinking about the same things .
and what we &apos;ve been working out is the implications , really , of the idea that the universe is made up of relations .
what &apos;s the fascination ?
they like to name anything .
and that &apos;s sort of what i &apos;ve been doing .
so if we cut open dracorex -- i cut open our dracorex -- and look , it was spongy inside , really spongy inside .
it &apos;s a big skull .
and that doesn &apos;t make any sense at all , because we don &apos;t know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older .
hillary &apos;s completely gone .
she was raped numerous times by many men .
here &apos;s my problem with that argument .
she was the cbs news correspondent who was brutally sexually assaulted in egypt &apos;s tahrir square right after this photo was taken .
when i was five years old , i found out that i was engaged to be married as soon as i reached puberty .
in our tradition , there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women , and it &apos;s a rite of passage to womanhood .
as you can imagine , i bled . i bled .
so the news came , i applied to school and i was accepted to randolph-macon woman &apos;s college in lynchburg , virginia , and i couldn &apos;t come without the support of the village , because i needed to raise money to buy the air ticket .
i learned that i did not have to trade part of my body to get an education . i had a right .
but she was older . she was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade .
i want to challenge you today that to be the first , because people will follow you .
we have tried these plants at our own building in delhi , which is a 50,000-square-feet , 20-year-old building .
but then , they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him , but he never told the son .
i want you to true your wheels : be honest about the praise that you need to hear .
now in the early 1970s , in ankara , that was a bit unusual .
and it &apos;s happening everywhere , among liberals and conservatives , agnostics and believers , the rich and the poor , east and west alike .
i skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days .
for me , like millions of other people around the world today , english is an acquired language .
you &apos;re expected to write informative , poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant-garde to your western colleagues .
i want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
as you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
and i would like to finish with an old sufi poem : &quot; come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot;
paul clayton : it ain &apos;t no use to sit and sigh now , darlin &apos; , and it ain &apos;t no use to sit and cry now . bd : it ain &apos;t no use to sit and wonder why , babe , if you don &apos;t know by now , and it ain &apos;t no use to sit and wonder why , babe , it &apos;ll never do somehow . okay , now , there &apos;s a lot of these .
you can do multi-fingered gestures on it , and boy have we patented it .
okay , so that &apos;s in &apos; 96 . here &apos;s in 2010 .
nothing is original , says kirby ferguson , creator of everything is a remix . from bob dylan to steve jobs , he says our most celebrated creators borrow , steal and transform .
so , for example , there are doctors in china who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
that funds everything in the u.k .
so what we &apos;re saying , essentially , is maybe that &apos;s a habitat for life in the solar system .
earthrise from apollo 8 .
and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element .
now that &apos;s an incredible phenomena , because it &apos;s a star that sits there .
it was a picture of earth captured in that frame of saturn .
you could have made it in the 1920s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had penicillin .
the red dots have exploded .
madeleine albright : this is &quot; breaking the glass ceiling . &quot;
i get there , and there are six other women , out of 183 .
and i said , &quot; thank you for being here . &quot;
i called my parents up .
i walked up to ashland , oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .
they &apos;re going to save your grade , and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money , then you can register for that class and they &apos;ll give you the grade . &quot;
what are you going to do with a master &apos;s degree ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , i want to make a difference . &quot;
what possessed me to say this thing ?
we have to change now .
and that brings me to the point of my talk , actually , how constraints , big creative constraints , can boost creativity .
and he was wearing a green hood so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction and replace it with robert lepage &apos;s head .
so here they are .
so , yeah .
this is michael and benedicta , and they &apos;re alive thanks in large part to dr. patricia asamoah -- she &apos;s amazing -- and the global fund , which all of you financially support , whether you know it or not .
so the pride of lions is the proof of concept .
daylight , you could call it , transparency .
we are going to win because we don &apos;t play their dirty games .
after , the building was recycled .
over two million people became refugees .
finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
and i was very lucky .
long before sustainability became a buzzword , architect shigeru ban had begun his experiments with ecologically-sound building materials such as cardboard tubes and paper . his remarkable structures are often intended as temporary housing , designed to help the dispossessed in disaster-struck nations such as haiti , rwanda or japan . yet equally often the buildings remain a beloved part of the landscape long after they have served their intended purpose .
as weeks of deprivation stretched into months , some resorted to eating tulip bulbs .
or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be .
and if i haven &apos;t revealed my prejudices already , i think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers , building electronic computers , which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers , which will build new electronic computers , and so forth .
now for the last 25 years , ned seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of dna strands coming together .
i mixed them up , heated them , cooled them down , and i got 50 billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water .
now , this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer , so we have a long way to go .
you can encode the number 32 in the right-hand side of a dna origami , and when you add those tiles that count , they will start to count -- they will read that 32 and they &apos;ll stop at 32 .
so you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation .
so fingers crossed .
now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained .
illegal wildlife trade in brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna , especially birds , and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month , and transported far from their origins , to be sold mainly in rio de janeiro and são paulo .
and on the bottom , my personal favorite , the little male over there , four hours after his release he was together with a wild female .
so unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity , you &apos;re actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody , okay ?
and yet , what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there &apos;s a very , very strong disproportionality at work , that actually what changes our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportionate to the degree of expense entailed , or the degree of force that &apos;s applied .
i said , &quot; it &apos;s really , really easy . &quot;
that is actually strategy , and i &apos;m not denying that strategy has a role .
this song kind of came out of all of that .
and this is essential to the progress of science , or exploration of what is possible .
for the second demo , i have this wii remote that &apos;s actually next to the tv .
and i also was taught , coupled with that , that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job , apparently , to help .
i stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as i had before .
in fact , those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note .
in fact , no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all .
it &apos;s about retelling the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity , validates a partnership relationship , not a relationship that &apos;s based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen .
this continued attention -- this ongoing attention -- is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us .
so they can be a cash , or a cause , investor .
what do you think of people in poverty ? maybe what jessica jackley once did : &quot; they &quot; need &quot; our &quot; help , in the form of a few coins in a jar . the co-founder of kiva.org talks about how her attitude changed -- and how her work with microloans has brought new power to people who live on a few dollars a day .
these predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the wmap satellite of the cosmic microwave background , which is an imprint of the very early universe .
it will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years , let alone the next thousand or million .
let &apos;s consider for a while the option of monotasking .
so each idea has its own meme-ome , and each idea is unique with that , but of course , ideas , they borrow from each other , they kind of steal sometimes , and they certainly build on each other , and we can go through mathematically and take the meme-ome from one talk and compare it to the meme-ome from every other talk , and if there &apos;s a similarity between the two of them , we can create a link and represent that as a graph , just like eric and i are connected .
this is their kind of resonance for the conversation around the environment .
we used a measure of ecological diversity to get this .
there &apos;s a fish with glowing eyes , pulsating eyes .
positively amazing . here &apos;s two males fighting .
so we all are africans , and welcome home .
but finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor .
and i said , &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; because there were elephants and lions , and the people were scared and went somewhere else .
and how old was she when she died ?
so , the still-growing brain in this individual tells us that childhood , which requires an incredible social organization , a very complex social organization , emerged over three million years ago .
one is to continue to see a poor , ill , crying africa , carrying guns , that depends on other people forever , or to promote an africa which is confident , peaceful , independent , but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time .
taking tests is stressful , but bubbling in a scantron does not stop bullets from bursting .
i figured , they &apos;re not workaholics . they &apos;re workafrolics .
or failing that , do the eight things -- and trust me , these are the big eight things that lead to success .
adam ostrow : hello .
adam ostrow : after your final status update
and importantly , it &apos;s a rich source of vitamin b12 .
now i &apos;m an economist , i &apos;m not a doctor , but i see the god complex around me all the time in my fellow economists .
five thousand products -- imagine counting every product category in cesar hidalgo &apos;s data .
and we have a problem-solving technique that works .
it turns out to be very important .
and eventually , they &apos;ll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets -- if , of course , they haven &apos;t already done so .
because it &apos;s so hard to admit our own fallibility .
would you like to close down the trial now , or should we wait until we have robust results ? &quot;
i tried to emulate him , but i realized it is very difficult to make good mistakes . &quot;
and behavior like this from janitors , from technicians , from nurses and , if we &apos;re lucky now and then , from doctors , doesn &apos;t just make people feel a little better , it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well .
a dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a detroit tigers game at the ballpark .
we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis .
we need more rules for the bankers , god knows .
any incentive system can be subverted by bad will .
just at this ted we heard talks from several moral heroes .
and any moral work depends upon practical wisdom .
wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons .
in his own reported words , he was convinced at first that what had happened couldn &apos;t have been real .
like fundamentalists of all religious stripes , they have no questions , only answers .
after keeping company with him as a writer for the past five years , i can &apos;t see that he &apos;d be anything but utterly outraged at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak and act in his name in the middle east and elsewhere today .
now we &apos;ve got f18s and f22s , and if somebody loses an arm , we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it . &quot;
and i told them i &apos;d build them an arm .
there &apos;s randy , these guys are passing a rubber little puck between them .
&quot; well , would it help if i ... &quot;
and we saw lots of these kids , lots of them .
this is not a happy thing . look , if this happens to you , i can give you ... this stuff is still not as good at the original equipment . &quot;
it is an easy answer .
those three trends are the ability to engineer cells , the ability to engineer tissues , and robots .
and the problem with this stuff is , now that the bill &apos;s come due , it turns out santa isn &apos;t quite as cute when it &apos;s summertime .
it makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to alaska in the overall scheme of things .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
and you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn &apos;t , and where it was in the phase .
but , of course , for most of us , we know how to grow teeth , and therefore we can take adult stem teeth , put them on a biodegradable mold , re-grow a tooth , and simply implant it .
if you don &apos;t have a flat world , that &apos;s not good , which is why the robot &apos;s we &apos;re designing today are a little different .
very primitive .
and i think this isn &apos;t 1,000 years out .
but if that &apos;s happened in the last 5,000 days , what &apos;s going to happen in the next 5,000 days ?
because in fact , that &apos;s how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the web works .
and if you imagine what , say , just as an example , what google labs has in terms of experiments with google docs , google spreadsheets , blah , blah , blah -- all these things are going to become web based .
attention is the currency .
so that &apos;s what we were doing .
a semantic web , web 3.0 , giant global graph -- we &apos;re kind of trying out what we want to call this thing .
so we are the web , that &apos;s what this thing is .
and the one is us . we are in the one .
he was underneath , not breathing for 45 minutes .
so , i got my hands on that chemical , filled the sink up with it , and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in , which was really impossible .
then i learned that you have to take a huge breath , and just hold and relax and never let any air out , and just hold and relax through all the pain .
i wanted to try holding my breath everywhere .
so , it &apos;s like base camp everest .
i completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what i needed to do .
so , i figured i &apos;m better off just fighting and staying there until i black out , at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that .
and i think that there is some weird thing -- that i had died or something had happened .
and after about five years of doing this , i was arrested for kidnapping .
and how i &apos;ve come to view what happened to me is a viral , memetic infection .
so let &apos;s make a little test .
because brains are expensive .
you can influence your own technologies you have invented .
this is what we are using . &quot;
and then finally , it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery , which actually digests the food we cook .
we have learned to talk to the big brain -- taste and reward , as you know .
so the best way of explaining it is to just show it .
they couldn &apos;t all be on stage , but we &apos;re going to bring their aura to the stage , so here they are .
okay . now we &apos;re going to switch back into the aurasma application , and what tamara &apos;s going to do is tag that video that we just took onto my badge , so that i can remember it forever .
but it is not so .
i hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial .
the volume of a lung is very small , but what about the area of the lung ?
i was very much involved in it , but then turned my attention to other phenomena .
but painting for a long time had a fractal side .
what got you in that strange business ? &quot;
now , i get to the final thing , which is the set of which my name is attached .
and then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place .
but first , i need to talk to you about what i consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category .
this recycling system has been in place for the last billion years .
if you &apos;re in china , you might use a rice husk or a cottonseed hull .
best of all , when it gets to the customer , it &apos;s not trash .
we altered our ecological niche by creating civilization .
this is the largest cat in the world -- the lion-tiger hybrid .
and right now the fda is trying to make a final decision on whether , pretty soon , you could be eating this fish -- it &apos;ll be sold in the stores .
and what they &apos;ve done here is they &apos;ve put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top , and it &apos;s on a big computer tracking ball .
they then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm , which you see here in the picture , put the arm in another room .
and so , we need to ask ourselves some questions .
they probably were simply following the wisdom that has come down the ages , this adage that when you &apos;re making decisions , especially decisions of importance , it &apos;s best to be in charge , it &apos;s best to be in control , it &apos;s best to be in the driver &apos;s seat .
and you know that .
how do you know that ?
you say , you know what ? i should have chosen the other tea .
it is always the same , never the same , endlessly fascinating .
the dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year .
sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way .
we then pull the piles up through the dune and we &apos;re able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up .
my design , as it takes you down the rabbit hole , is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world .
in fact , the ideal may be to use no words at all .
to borrow a concept from my country &apos;s cia , it helps you to soften up your audience .
and for some reason that day , instead , i asked myself a question , and it was , where does this stuff go ?
this is marie saylee , nine months old .
think about it . that little boy who &apos;s running back into his house , he may have a nice , clean fresh water supply , but he &apos;s got dirty hands that he &apos;s going to contaminate his water supply with .
maybe it &apos;s the ick factor .
but not just that .
all we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent , shameful issue that it is .
so here is what we did . we put a 10-cent digital transponder , a data tag , in the appliance plug .
but before i talk about the political chemistry , i actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil .
i am helpless over this . &quot;
and then , of course , there was john d. rockefeller .
we stopped drilling in anwr , but we didn &apos;t actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed .
so the people of the gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less-clean environment .
what &apos;s important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump , to actually being active and to really sort of thinking about who we are , having kind of that special moment , where we connect the dots actually at the pump .
so many of you know that that &apos;s beethoven &apos;s seventh symphony .
you want it ?
jn : yeah .
the acoustics of music are much harder than those of language .
the sound quality , or the sound of the sound is how i like to describe timbre , tone color -- they cannot tell these things whatsoever .
now i want to show you one last video .
and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing .
i carried on for another five or six strokes , and then i had nothing in my body , and i went down to the bottom of the lake .
and i &apos;m going to focus on afghanistan and the arab world with the uae , how they &apos;re changing tribal societies , not by introducing western ideas , but by being integrated into the language in those places .
but , once she started to win , then they got behind her again .
and you all have chosen your own instruments to fulfill this mission of creating a better world .
they are oppressed .
he had a clear shot at the german soldiers who came to occupy a free country , his country , our country .
why has violence decreased ?
that is why we train police officers , we train judges , we train public prosecutors around the world .
so how many of you know what i &apos;m talking about ?
it &apos;ll approximate that shape . we do this for real in the test tube .
however , it &apos;s hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization .
now we may find that there are places that are really , really dense and still hold onto their cars , but the reality is that , by and large , what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect , where people simply stop driving as much , and increasingly , more and more people , if they &apos;re surrounded by places that make them feel at home , give up their cars altogether .
and in fact , even space itself is turning into a service .
alex steffen : the shareable future of cities
so you &apos;ve got to focus .
if we could convert 0.03 percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy , we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030 .
but if you ask me , what will it cost for one mips of computing in 2010 , or the cost to sequence a base pair of dna in 2012 , or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014 , it turns out that those are very predictable .
and then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions , and biological evolution kept accelerating .
that hit a wall . they couldn &apos;t shrink them and keep the vacuum .
in terms of price performance , that &apos;s a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate .
there are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place on the chromosome .
you could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours -- so , &quot; honey , i &apos;m in the pool , &quot; will take on a whole new meaning .
this will be a routine feature in a cell phone .
human life expectancy is expanding . it was 37 in 1800 , and with this sort of biotechnology , nano-technology revolutions , this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead .
now damien knows all about condoms , he said there &apos;s just not in demand .
i &apos;m going to talk about your mindset .
and you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime .
and what has happened in the world , i will show now .
and asia could have social development before they got the economic development .
we have the high income countries here , with the united states as a leading power ; we have the emerging economies in the middle , which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout ; and we have the low income countries here .
it &apos;s eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries .
and it is the dhs that makes it possible to know this .
and third chance for sweden , against brazil here .
this is dollar per person . this is hiv in the countries .
so to just end up , there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest , which we don &apos;t know .
and this institution will have a very crucial role , not for united states , but for the world .
now , first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are , to be on the brink of true global social organization .
and there &apos;s something i worry about especially , which is that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope .
it &apos;s especially hard to do when people hate you , ok , because you don &apos;t really , in a sense , want to completely understand why people hate you .
&quot; good . &quot;
that we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses .
you can ask , how do you stack up for positive emotion , for meaning , for flow , against literally tens of thousands of other people ?
and third , the meaningful life .
when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at 9 : 30 in the morning , time stops for him . and it stops till the closing bell .
it &apos;s being done in a rigorous manner .
it turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction .
as laura lee told us , design , and , i believe , entertainment and technology , can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well .
and in fact , i think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things .
is it a dangerous predator , or is it just the wind ?
and what do you see here ?
the fish is degraded 20 percent , 50 percent and then the one i showed you , 70 percent .
just right , you &apos;re creative , and yet you don &apos;t fall for too much baloney .
you see a dolphin here , and there &apos;s a dolphin , and there &apos;s a dolphin .
the one on the left . okay . so i &apos;ll rotate it so it &apos;ll be the one on the right .
there &apos;s somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings , whether it &apos;s the illuminati or the bilderbergers .
we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe , you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences , near-death experiences , which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there .
okay , now i &apos;m going to ask you to pucker up .
and then they used public death records to find out who died .
you &apos;re going too slow .
i no longer want to get rid of your stress .
well , oxytocin doesn &apos;t only act on your brain .
it seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone &apos;s life expectancy .
it &apos;s a network for a transportation of matter .
the next big question is , what &apos;s the cost ?
over time , we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions , lifting millions of people out of poverty .
at least , it &apos;s powerful enough that if i show you these four songs , and i remind you that this is &quot; smells like teen spirit , &quot; you can probably correctly guess , without listening to any music at all , that the song a die hard nirvana fan would enjoy is this song , &quot; i &apos;ll stick around &quot; by the foo fighters , whose lead singer is dave grohl , who was the drummer in nirvana .
there &apos;s no closed captioning for the ted theme song , and we &apos;re missing it , but if you &apos;ve watched enough of these , you hear it in your mind &apos;s ear , and then applause starts .
he may or may not have been the first person to climb everest , more than 30 years before edmund hillary .
there was a bit of fun , a bit of joy .
this is a photo of captain scott and his team .
explorer ben saunders wants you to go outside ! not because it &apos;s always pleasant and happy , but because that &apos;s where the meat of life is , &quot; the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days . &quot; saunders &apos; next outdoor excursion ? to try to be the first in the world to walk from the coast of antarctica to the south pole and back again .
now i have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous .
this is europa .
there are more stages involved here than i &apos;ve got time to tell you about , but basically we drive through the space , we populate it with environmental variables -- sulphide , halide , things like that .
the next thing we need are places to stay on orbit .
this is an idea that , again , came out of livermore back in 1989 , with dr. lowell wood &apos;s group .
to bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed .
they &apos;re demographics , education , debt and inequality .
you &apos;ll notice that in 1891 , over on the left , we were at about 5,000 dollars .
all the rest went to the top one percent .
what about the internal combustion engine , which was invented in 1879 ?
the earliest cell phones , the earliest personal computers were invented in the 1970s .
and that includes nature , and nurture , and what i refer to as nightmares .
but , of course , they ended up dying , six months apart .
but when you make those associations , you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story , and what you &apos;re finding is what matters . the meaning .
but , both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning , or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions .
and then , after a while , i had to ask myself , &quot; why do we take on knowledge , why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us ? &quot;
especially when good things happen , and , in particular , when bad things happen .
and they agreed , and between the time i saw this place and the next time i went , there was a terrible accident . a man , an old man , fell asleep , and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm .
or rather , if there is an answer , it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything , and that is good , because then i will discover something new .
i didn &apos;t know that ; that &apos;s pretty cool .
that means the next time you are in the grocery store , take a look at the four people ahead of you in line .
that &apos;s the idea behind voodoo dolls , and possibly also cave paintings .
fifty years later , as a tribute , the international space station , which is still up there tonight , synced its orbit with gagarin &apos;s orbit , at the exact same time of day , and filmed it , so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride , possibly a lonely one , the first person to ever see such a thing .
and i started spraying that on the streets in cairo .
and that makes me really sad because i &apos;m sick and tired of things not working .
this isn &apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not make-believe .
it &apos;s a serious gene .
but no , now our meme goes into work where we don &apos;t value play .
it &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
these are the benefits to play .
it improves our ability to learn .
i asked them all .
i &apos;m going to let you make decisions . i &apos;m going to empower you , and i &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
today is the start of the uprising .
and i think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium .
they were coming at a pretty regular clip , but as the story was building , normally , as a reader , you control how fast you move through a text , but in this case , the new yorker did , and they were sending you bit by bit by bit , and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line .
it gave you everything you wanted from rahm emanuel , particularly in the expletive department .
so with real-time storytelling , blurring the lines between fact and fiction , the real world and the digital world , flexible identity , anonymity , these are all tools that we have accessible to us , and i think that they &apos;re just the building blocks .
but i think we &apos;re in for another change , about two generations after the top of that curve , once the effects of a declining population start to settle in .
it &apos;s not good .
the climate has changed . i will show you : no more flooding , no more fires .
if you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil , on a clay soil , on a steep slope , on flat soil , you put those different recipes ; if you combine them , out of that comes a business plan , comes a work plan , and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have , and you can do it .
so you have to do it with the local people .
this is what it looks like in reality ; you have this irregular ring around it , with strips of 100 meters wide , with sugar palms that can provide income for 648 families .
this transponder that we operate with the european space agency -- it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture .
we have this road going around the area , which brings the people electricity and water from our own area .
so if we want to help the orangutans -- what i actually set out to do -- we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit .
curitiba , rio : it &apos;s like two birds kissing themselves .
it &apos;s the concept of the city , the design of the city , that &apos;s also important , too . and also , how to teach the children .
we don &apos;t rip our family portrait , even if we don &apos;t like the nose of our uncle , because this portrait is you .
please , allow me just two minutes .
&quot; sputnik &quot; was downtown , the negative . it wasn &apos;t touched .
that &apos;s my daughter and me .
all of these things were made during the last 75 years .
as i said , i started to do these things 75 years ago .
so he asked me , could he please visit me , and then finally he did , and explained to me that what i did now in my shop was an anachronism , that the industrial revolution had broken out , and that i rather should join the factory .
and among other things , other countries i worked , was in the soviet union , where i worked from &apos; 32 to &apos; 37 -- actually , to &apos; 36 .
so we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule , past-tense conjugation .
rufus griscom : now i think of our story as starting a few years earlier . av : that &apos;s true .
av : yes , you can see where the disconnect was happening for us .
you &apos;re not allowed to chart love .
that continued into the the hospital . it was really exhilarating .
and of course , it made me question , if i wasn &apos;t able to have another child , what would that mean for my marriage , and just me as a woman .
we said , something is wrong here .
it &apos;s a bad idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
and then , even when they &apos;re not saying appalling things and they &apos;re really trying to do serious research , well , it &apos;s been slow . progress has been slow .
okay , now i promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness .
now , that &apos;s the common-sense definition . that &apos;s our target .
okay , that &apos;s the first feature of consciousness .
well , the first one i said was , consciousness doesn &apos;t exist , it &apos;s an illusion . well , i &apos;ve already answered that .
either a conscious agent is carrying out the computation , or he &apos;s got a piece of machinery that admits of a computational interpretation .
and actually , chris called me a week after i &apos;d given my talk and he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to start putting them online .
i meet all kinds of people who don &apos;t enjoy what they do .
the great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense ; things that people think , &quot; well , it can &apos;t be done any other way because that &apos;s the way it &apos;s done . &quot;
great . now , those over 25 , could you put your hands up if you &apos;re wearing your wristwatch ?
certain sorts of college .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
in a way , it did not for me .
now in this room , there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business , in multimedia , in the internet .
and i rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase .
it &apos;s my response , my attitude , to oppression that i &apos;ve got control over , and that i can do something about .
how can this be made better ?
this century there &apos;s a shift .
a lot of it is due to a book written by an 80-year-old man in boston , gene sharp .
it &apos;s just , it &apos;s just , i just would like us all to go there .
it &apos;s a bit of , well , we could call it night , we could call it the 96 percent of gravity that we don &apos;t know about , dark matter , placed in space , anyway , another version of a human space in space at large , but i don &apos;t know if you can see , the eyes are indicated , they &apos;re closed .
for me , art is not about objects of high monetary exchange .
now , how might that be ? let me give you an example .
for example , most other germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying , &quot; morgen regnet es , &quot; quite literally to an english ear , &quot; it rain tomorrow . &quot;
let me show you how far you can do that .
does this have cumulative effects ?
we now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time .
he wrote a long time ago , you know , thanks to the invention of the internet , web technology , mini-cams and more , the means of artistic production have been democratized in the 1930s , if any of you wanted to make a movie , you had to work for warner brothers or rko because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more ?
but the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward , especially in industries we can &apos;t even imagine yet , just as they have been central to the ipod and the computer game industries , which few , if any of us come have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago .
but it was she who ended up learning all the arabic words for the local plants , as well as their uses -- medicinal uses , cosmetics , cooking , herbal .
now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone ?
we need one today more than ever .
if you can &apos;t think a thought , you are stuck .
what an exciting and inspiring event .
here you have a retina .
so as you can see , the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder-transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns -- and it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s pretty good -- and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic , the responses really don &apos;t .
sheila nirenberg : a prosthetic eye to treat blindness
i mean they &apos;re incredibly small , you have to have a microscope to see one .
the way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of hawaii , just in sort of shallow knee-deep water .
what &apos;s important for today &apos;s talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions .
so we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria , and what we &apos;ve found now is that in fact , bacteria are multilingual .
so we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules -- which you saw -- but they &apos;re a little bit different .
by using these two molecules they can say &quot; me &quot; and they can say &quot; you . &quot;
this delusion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us .
and he was rubbing it with a cloth .
and they &apos;re maggoting happily in the dog &apos;s hindquarters there .
&quot; maitreya &quot; means love , &quot; the loving one , &quot; in sanskrit .
therefore all of you , in the buddhist view , in some previous life , although you don &apos;t remember it and neither do i , have been my mother -- for which i do apologize for the trouble i caused you .
and this is the way you do it . you take any being who looks weird to you , and you see how they could be familiar to you .
so it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy , because they &apos;ll stop being your enemy because that &apos;s too much trouble .
and materialism , they think they get out of it just by not existing , by dying , but they don &apos;t .
lying just beneath the surface of those arguments , with passions raging on all sides , are big questions of moral philosophy , big questions of justice .
that &apos;s peter ?
i want to compete .
charlie : it doesn &apos;t matter ; it &apos;s not part of the game .
the supreme court decided .
but letting everyone ride in a cart would have been , i suspect , more anathema to the golfing greats and to the pga , even than making an exception for casey martin .
thank you .
first , of course , the economic meltdown .
have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us ?
and for me , this sort of deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and also to study the science of sound , particularly music .
and so i think that we &apos;re going to see over the next 10 , 20 , 30 years a real science of creativity that &apos;s burgeoning and is going to flourish .
and so through this piano keyboard , we now have the means to take a musical process and study it .
really , consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe .
cl : at this point , i &apos;ll take a few moments .
this is the control condition . this is what they memorized .
but we want to get at the root of what is creative genius , neurologically , and i think , with these methods , we &apos;re getting close to being there .
you get different kinds of psychopaths .
so i think after several generations , and here is the idea , we really have a tinderbox .
and they all seemed to be ok .
it &apos;s understanding data .
and if you see those metal bits there -- those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles , so it can measure how fast they &apos;re traveling .
the quarks , these pink things , are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body .
i &apos;ve been a little disingenuous , because i &apos;ve expanded it out in all its gory detail .
well , what the higgs does is , it gives mass to the fundamental particles .
well , they do change in strength .
it continued to expand about 300 million years .
whether it &apos;s something simple like turning on the lights with a switch , or even as complex as programming robotics , we have always had to give a command to a machine , or even a series of commands , in order for it to do something for us .
it only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle .
and this one is difficult because it &apos;s all about being able to visualize something that doesn &apos;t exist in our physical world .
in this example , facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands .
and even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
and if that &apos;s not enough , smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others .
so it &apos;s time for change .
crime did fall .
the corruption in the state administration of countries like albania -- it &apos;s not up to me to say also like greece -- can be fought only by modernization .
make a city beautiful , curb corruption . edi rama took this deceptively simple path as mayor of tirana , albania , where he instilled pride in his citizens by transforming public spaces with colorful designs . with projects that put the people first , rama decreased crime -- and showed his citizens they could have faith in their leaders . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .
we need people in our organizations who know what it &apos;s like to work with big data .
basically a restaurant just like any other .
we put them in bottles , refrigerate them , and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again .
so , water is a very important aspect .
i &apos;ve got metal and earth to come .
i think it &apos;s important .
but those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth , when it all came together .
i started receiving threats to be killed , raped , just to stop this campaign .
so if you look at the map of the world , that only leaves two countries : saudi arabia , and the other society is the rest of the world .
more than 13,000 voters answered this poll : whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech .
so for me , it &apos;s not about only these small steps .
when i turn 40 , i &apos;ll have a one-hour video that includes just my 30s .
i think everyone would have a different interpretation of it .
this is the wave , going from left to right . you can see this one .
and this is the water feeler .
so this is the first self-replicating species that we &apos;ve had on the planet whose parent is a computer .
when we started this out , we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem , which is why we chose the smallest genome .
it turns out , the dna in the bacterial cell was actually methylated , and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme , from digesting the dna .
so , there are four major watermarks all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code .
but we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we &apos;re already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool .
so , ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that , and there are many others . the web is one .
and then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere , drop their wings , dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs .
so , things happen to an ant colony .
the queen &apos;s in there somewhere ; she just lays eggs .
and i was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed independently of the others , knowing its place on the assembly line .
and the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year .
so the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance .
the simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony -- and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule , like &quot; i expect to meet another forager every three seconds . &quot;
and no one &apos;s talking about depression , but we need to be , because right now it &apos;s a massive problem .
it &apos;s something you live with . it &apos;s something you live in .
but right now , depression is society &apos;s deep cut that we &apos;re content to put a band-aid over and pretend it &apos;s not there .
there were only about 2,000 of our species left .
just a thought .
so it has four rotors .
and the obstacles can be moving .
and that &apos;s how it populates this map .
check out this image above the orange line in boston .
again , a bit counterintuitive .
i got my ph.d. studying honeybee health .
some other images here in telling a part of the story that really made urban beekeeping terrific is in new york city , beekeeping was illegal until 2010 .
i &apos;m talking about opec oil .
and it does not require a refinery .
this stuff is everywhere .
i think it &apos;s closer to a billion .
how in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point ?
it happened through a principle known as kin selection .
so , they do understand that if you want to be treated well , you treat other people well .
either way , your fortunes add up to zero . that &apos;s a zero-sum game .
good things happen , and it &apos;s good for much of the world .
once we define somebody as an enemy , we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes , just naturally .
the hard problem that alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers .
but he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship .
because it does take skill and practice , too .
margaret heffernan : dare to disagree
now , there &apos;s no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor &apos;s body .
so we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of brad &apos;s head , aged to appear as benjamin , and attach that to the body of the real actor .
but we did know one thing .
we needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone .
and so , on the left , we were seeing 100,000 polygons .
but we needed to get a database of him doing more than that .
and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from .
he &apos;s also in an old age home , he &apos;s in a nursing home around other old people , so he had to look exactly the same as the others .
and the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country and being sold and traded .
this is sadua who came and surrendered his bear .
traditionally , the kalandar community of india has survived by capturing sloth bear cubs and training them to &quot; dance &quot; through extreme cruelty . kartick satyanarayan has been able to put an end to this centuries-old practice , and in so doing discovered a lesson of wider significance : make the practitioners part of the solution .
but i like to pretend that it comes with ease .
and when i would go up to the country , he would teach me things like deer hunting , which meant getting lost with a gun basically -- and trout fishing and stuff like that .
for some reason i keep remembering that lady jane grey was queen of england when she was only 15 .
well , this did not make sense to me .
we want to make this a structure , and ask the question , how do the cells do that ?
could we calm them down -- they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up -- and make them to the level of the normal ?
this is a single human breast cell in three dimensions .
so , it &apos;s a wonderful new horizon , it &apos;s a wonderful thing to discover for the young and the passionate old , and that &apos;s me .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
you can see that they work together , they pull at the same moment .
so it &apos;s actually fairly simple for them .
and then there &apos;s a cognitive channel , which is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else .
now we did a very simple experiment .
and if the partner puts pressure on them -- so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them -- then the choices go down .
then she sees the other one getting grape , and you will see what happens .
and so we work on these particular issues to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up , so to speak , without necessarily god and religion involved , and to see how we can get to an evolved morality .
you may think that &apos;s a weapon right there . in fact , that &apos;s a stamp . i used a stamp to defend canada &apos;s borders .
let me give you a very recent example , as in , like , last week .
the phone , in contrast , the most lies .
in fact , they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch , what we say in the lab as &quot; strong rounding up . &quot;
we &apos;ve been talking , i guess , about fires and caves and saber-toothed tigers . i don &apos;t know what they talked about , but they were doing a lot of talking , and like i said , there &apos;s a lot of humans evolving speaking , about 100 billion people in fact .
all right . slightly more for b .
first , lying online can be very dangerous , right ?
man 10 : it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s been really important to make it comfortable .
so here &apos;s his first follower with a crucial role ; he &apos;s going to show everyone else how to follow .
if you really care about starting a movement , have the courage to follow and show others how to follow .
now i should know , because for 13 years of my life , i was involved in an extreme islamist organization .
and the consequences that this is having is that it &apos;s affecting the political climate across europe .
i &apos;ll talk you through one example , and that &apos;s the example that everyone here will be aware of , and that &apos;s the example of al-qaeda .
but actually going out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with islamist extremism .
whereas islamists and far-right organizations , for decades , have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots .
but generally , the trends that start in egypt have historically spread across the mena region , the middle east and north africa region .
camp one , 2,000 feet higher .
you can see the lhotse face is in profile , it &apos;s about a 45 degree angle . it takes two days to climb it , so you put the camp halfway through .
ok , this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself .
but they did what they could to stabilize the people .
the survivors came in one by one .
so you have the prefrontal cortex here , lighting up in red .
it just shows you what the power of the mind can do .
so it had its downsides .
and you have to reapply it every two to four hours .
so i finished .
and our founding fathers knew about this .
i &apos;m much more trying to add to some of the questions we &apos;re talking about .
and i &apos;ll start with what went right .
now we have the reverse tendency .
you believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this , it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie , it &apos;s going to be more difficult for them to steal and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill .
a few years ago , my colleagues and i were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people &apos;s decisions in social situations .
so what i &apos;m going to do is show you how to spot a couple of classic moves , dead giveaways , really , for what &apos;s variously been called neuro-bunk , neuro-bollocks , or , my personal favorite , neuro-flapdoodle .
these scans , the clinics say , can help prevent alzheimer &apos;s disease , solve weight and addiction issues , overcome marital conflicts , and treat , of course , a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to adhd .
social finance , the organization i helped set up , cares about social stuff .
investors get two opportunities : for the first time , they can invest in social change .
why is this so different for people ?
gee , that &apos;s swell . i guess you &apos;re just my fatal attraction-ie . you &apos;re my clonie . thank you .
any lebanese by applause ? lebanese .
there &apos;s so much , we laugh , right ?
&quot; &#91; imitating arabic &#93; -- tutti frutti ! &quot;
we start our journey in the central deserts .
but whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space , we have no sense of what space sounds like .
thomas watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected .
fifty years on from watson &apos;s accidental encounter with the sun , jansky &apos;s careful listening ushered in a new age of space exploration : the radio astronomy age .
i feel it &apos;s sort of like the vimalakirti sutra , an ancient work from ancient india in which the buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area , vaishali , and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him .
and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other , and each one tries to get out of their own , and ultimately it fails of course , and then we &apos;re back into this thing .
i , me , me , mine . it &apos;s like a perfect song , that song . a perfect teaching .
i won &apos;t even say what they do . but he feels it .
in our hyperlinked world , we can know anything , anytime . and this mass enlightenment , says buddhist scholar bob thurman , is our first step toward buddha nature .
that is the slurry being poured onto paper , basically . that &apos;s the line running .
last but not least , bill gates , i know you invented windows .
and i will give you several examples .
he said , &quot; miraculous . &quot;
they were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound .
her friend says , &quot; buy it already . &quot;
because there &apos;s no copyright protection in this industry , there &apos;s a very open and creative ecology of creativity .
johanna blakley : imagine that .
and that actually reminded me of jazz great , charlie parker .
but even though it &apos;s the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there , they don &apos;t register their garments , generally , and there &apos;s not a lot of litigation .
they share their designs .
it is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds .
what these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions , across all faiths , across all continents -- a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others , and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted , see injuries that need to be corrected , see problems that need to be rectified .
then take iran itself , and what people are doing today : following what happened to neda , people who are preventing the security services of iran finding those people who are blogging out of iran , any by everybody who is blogging , changing their address to tehran , iran , and making it difficult for the security services .
take climate change . is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem , where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that , when we want to create a global carbon market , but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem ?
beside that photograph there is the information about his life .
and so here &apos;s the challenge : i want you to help me create a fully 3d , dynamic , parameterized contact model .
they can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw -- in the probability of contact , the movement of that surface and the type of footholds that are present .
and look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain .
did you touch it ?
now just because we have a distributed foot and spines doesn &apos;t mean you can climb vertical surfaces .
now if we look at animals , though , to be really maneuverable in all surfaces , the animals use hybrid mechanisms that include claws , and spines , and hairs , and pads , and glue , and capillary adhesion and a whole bunch of other things .
and when you watch how they detach it , it is bizarre .
i call the new robot rise , for &quot; robot in scansorial environment &quot; -- that &apos;s a climbing environment -- and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot .
it &apos;s a very challenging task . but more to come later .
i think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art , science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on .
and then from underground to underwater .
does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is -- any guesses ?
you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s bearing cones down the center .
so , now i want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet .
it &apos;s going to change the way we do astronomy , it &apos;s going to change the way we teach astronomy and i think most importantly it &apos;s going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe .
i think the worldwide telescope will convince you that we may be tiny , but we are truly , wonderfully significant .
there &apos;s a 10 percent differential between getting ba &apos;s and all graduate programs , with guys falling behind girls .
for every 400 movies made in hollywood , there are 11,000 now made porn videos .
popcorn immediately goes out onto the web , talks to google , grabs the map , and puts it in the display .
now what &apos;s great about a multi-touch sensor is that , you know , i could be doing this with as many fingers here , but of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user .
audience : where &apos;s your lab ?
and then what i can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time .
no one argues -- we all agree there &apos;s a problem .
it &apos;s like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it &apos;s the flu and it will just go away .
now we &apos;re experiencing one every week .
with a thousand juliáns working together , mexico would be a very different country .
we &apos;re facing a very powerful opponent .
it &apos;s about an m.p. called geoffrey dickens .
the laws of physics : invisible , eternal , omnipresent , all-powerful .
this is fascinating . you probably know , some of you , that cells are continually renewed . you can see it in skin and this kind of stuff .
what &apos;s the point of these radio waves that you &apos;ve found ? &quot;
in fact , we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words .
and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that &apos;s not the highest quality data .
alternatively , i could say , &quot; yesterday , i thrived . &quot;
but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 .
and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person .
it &apos;s kind of like genomics .
if you stub your toe , that &apos;s a one a &quot; argh . &quot;
your job is only to be human .
they said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance , hoping that others were alive and doing the same .
and together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums , and they &apos;re reading many ted authors and liking it .
but less than 24 hours , i was 13 miles away from those mosques , visiting one of our acumen investees , an incredible man , jawad aslam , who dares to live a life of immersion .
and she &apos;d say , &quot; i &apos;m not talking . &quot;
we each want to live a life of purpose , but where to start ? in this luminous , wide-ranging talk , jacqueline novogratz introduces us to people she &apos;s met in her work in &quot; patient capital &quot; -- people who have immersed themselves in a cause , a community , a passion for justice . these human stories carry powerful moments of inspiration .
in fact , i would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future .
just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again .
do you remember , i gave you those filters at the beginning .
and if they didn &apos;t take the flower , i threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away .
i &apos;ve always been with my band or my crew .
i become the hat after my own gigs , but i have to physically stand there and take the help from people , and unlike the guy in the opening band , i &apos;ve actually had a lot of practice standing there .
thank you .
they really make inside out their own project .
you go on the back of that truck , it takes your photo , 30 seconds later take it from the side , you &apos;re ready to rock .
even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians .
and lastly , the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted , &quot; the musician . &quot;
ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published .
she was just released a couple of weeks ago , and we &apos;re very concerned to see how long she will be free , because she is already out in the streets in rangoon , agitating for change .
i &apos;ll tell you the quick story .
and before i tell you about that , i just have to tell you this one little picture of graffiti there i picked off the web the other day .
so i got in -- in the ph.d. program in biophysics , and i was , all right , i &apos;m studying brains now , and i said , well , i want to study theory .
well , let &apos;s first take a look at what normal science looks like .
you &apos;re more complicated than your brain . you &apos;ve got a brain .
we &apos;re not smarter now than they were then .
a behavioral metric of what intelligence is , and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time .
no , really , that &apos;s what it is . it &apos;s about the size of a table napkin .
i already said the word &quot; sentence . &quot; in music , if you &apos;ve heard a song before , if you heard jill sing those songs before , when she sings them , the next note pops into your head already -- you anticipate it as you &apos;re going . if it was an album of music , the end of one album , the next song pops into your head .
every single moment . and finally , let &apos;s think about how we test intelligence .
you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence .
they couldn &apos;t anticipate cell phones and the internet and all this kind of stuff .
and we really , we really loved this machine .
we invaded iraq with a military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities .
in one of my books , i joke that ben &amp; amp ; jerry &apos;s should make a pacifist toothpaste -- doesn &apos;t kill germs , just asks them to leave .
another finding is that the unconscious , far from being dumb and sexualized , is actually quite smart .
and this revolution in who we are gives us a different way of seeing , i think , politics , a different way , most importantly , of seeing human capital .
a second skill is equal poise , the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind .
it seems so elementary .
tapping into the findings of his latest book , nytimes columnist david brooks unpacks new insights into human nature from the cognitive sciences -- insights with massive implications for economics and politics as well as our own self-knowledge . in a talk full of humor , he shows how you can &apos;t hope to understand humans as separate individuals making choices based on their conscious awareness .
but why do people want me to direct traffic , when i would much rather go fishing ?
the design has not changed .
you know , that ham butt is delicious ! there &apos;s no reason to throw it away .
we are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression : your speeches and your writing . and then , often people say to me , &quot; well , ok , how do i know that this word is real ? &quot;
there &apos;s a lot going on there .
so , enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help , and they &apos;re doing a good job of it .
so , this whole time i &apos;ve been saying , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . &quot;
pranitha &apos;s mother was a woman in prostitution , a prostituted person .
and that &apos;s what we do to all traffic survivors .
and one day she gives up on you and me , because we have no options for her .
we have trained girls as carpenters , as masons , as security guards , as cab drivers .
if i &apos;m here today , i &apos;m here not only as sunitha krishnan .
it makes me to stand here , so what i did , i &apos;d gone back to my early marriage days .
&quot; close your eyes . whatever i give , it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring , even a chocolate , i will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it .
finally , i came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood , but even after that , you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material . again , a stop-up .
i &apos;m sustaining on seventh year .
a magazine i &apos;d recently launched called business 2.0 was fatter than a telephone directory , busy pumping hot air into the bubble .
you can ask what are the psychological causes of it : nature ? nurture ? current circumstance ?
number three : i do want to , if i can , find a way of extending the ted experience throughout the year a little bit .
now , that &apos;s just one story about oil , and we could end it there and say , &quot; well , oil &apos;s going to last forever because , well , there &apos;s just a lot of it . &quot;
and to tell the next part of the story -- and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond .
how the molecules are put together .
the police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial , and when steve titus was put on trial for rape , the rape victim got on the stand and said , &quot; i &apos;m absolutely positive that &apos;s the man . &quot;
i study the opposite : when they remember , when they remember things that didn &apos;t happen or remember things that were different from the way they really were .
well out there in the real world , misinformation is everywhere .
but probably the worst was i suspected that a woman was innocent of abuse that was being claimed by her grown daughter .
but maybe my work has made me different from most people .
today i don &apos;t want to talk about beautiful babies , i want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design -- those sort of dorky teenage years where you &apos;re trying to figure out how the world works .
so it turns out that design for inspiration doesn &apos;t really -- i guess what i would say is , for us , for what i want to do , it &apos;s either too slow or it just doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s ineffective .
so jaundice affects two-thirds of newborns around the world .
from a phototherapy standpoint , maybe not the best behavior .
so that &apos;s the design for manufacture question .
are we designing for the world that we want ?
well i &apos;m trying to take a different approach .
well , who else would be in the house ?
she &apos;s wearing his wife &apos;s pearl earring .
what is he thinking about that &apos;s making him blush ?
george did not speak .
and of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
how would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility ?
that &apos;s my colleague . he &apos;s let it go .
so , in favor of the proposition , possibly shockingly , is one of , truly , the founders of the environmental movement , a long-standing tedster , the founder of the whole earth catalog , someone we all know and love , stewart brand .
then what happens to the waste ?
this is one from toshiba .
the high is the average of 103 scientific , peer-reviewed studies .
if you do a large scale expansion of nuclear energy across the world , and as a result there was just one nuclear bomb created that was used to destroy a city such as mumbai or some other big city , megacity , the additional death rates due to this averaged over 30 years and then scaled to the population of the u.s .
and now , if you go back to looking at geothermal , it &apos;s even smaller than both , and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing , but it &apos;s still pretty small .
of those , seven have nuclear weapons .
so if we get that through , then mark will solve these problems . thanks chris .
if we &apos;re going to keep the lights on , nuclear is that solution .
mj : so we &apos;ve analyzed the hour-by-hour power demand and supply , looking at solar , wind , using data for california .
david byrne , ethel + thomas dolby : &quot; flowers &quot; with string quartet
we can &apos;t keep doing that .
what &apos;s going to happen to our whole medical system ?
and we , all of us , have to understand that this is about us , that we can make a difference here .
so this is a typical menu .
i work with private companies who are willing to do r &amp; amp ; d with me , who are willing to do distribution for me , who are really willing to work to go into schools .
but we really have to educate .
you know what ? we should be ashamed .
if we abstract this process , and simplify it as much as possible , then we could start with a single sheet of paper , one surface , and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces .
in general , if we make a small change to the folding ratio , which is what you &apos;re seeing here , then the form changes correspondingly .
the more interesting question , perhaps , is , are these forms imaginable ?
and in this case , i used abs plastic to produce the columns , we used the bigger , faster machine , and they have a steel core inside , so they &apos;re structural , they can bear loads for once .
i &apos;ve learned to respect the lightning .
in reality , trying to go from fundamental knowledge to its application is more like this .
that &apos;s the good news .
i cannot play sports or do physical activities , but i have been able to take interest in things that progeria , luckily , does not limit .
well , we have to come up with a partnership between academia , government , the private sector , and patient organizations to make that so .
this is research that &apos;s high-risk , sometimes high-cost .
it &apos;s important for us to grow organically .
ask the chairpersons and ceos of sotheby &apos;s and christie &apos;s .
and this is one of our filmmakers &apos; products .
road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon .
now , stockholm is a medium-sized city , roughly two million people , but stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges , old bridges -- which means lots of road congestion .
all the cars were back again , and you even have to admire the car drivers . they adapt so extremely quickly .
which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with 20 percent , and reduced congestion by enormous numbers , and people aren &apos;t even aware that they have changed , and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along .
i heard prayers of the sufi -- humble muslims , hated by the taliban .
but i &apos;m here to tell you , &quot; patient &quot; is not a third-person word .
in fact , he said it was 70 to 80 percent of how we actually take care of our bodies .
the question was , where from ?
where does medical ability end and start ?
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while dad &apos;s still alive . &quot;
me being me , i put the numbers from my hospital &apos;s website from my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet .
there &apos;s a guy on twitter that i know , a health it guy outside boston , and he wrote the e-patient rap .
so she took it .
when dave debronkart learned he had a rare and terminal cancer , he turned to a group of fellow patients online -- and found the medical treatment that saved his life . now he calls on all patients to talk with one another , know their own health data , and make health care better one e-patient at a time . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
the door swings open , and the voice says , &quot; come in , for there is no room in this house for two i &apos;s , &quot; -- two capital i &apos;s , not these eyes -- &quot; for two egos . &quot;
we have access to it all .
feisal abdul rauf : lose your ego , find your compassion
ao : you did teach yourself to play , and as a consequence , playing the piano for you , derek , was a lot of knuckles and karate chops , and even a bit of nose going on in there .
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do .
dp : &quot; flight of the bumblebee &quot; on that note .
dp : he played &quot; chopsticks . &quot; ao : and played &quot; chopsticks . &quot;
it is in fact a citrus juicer and when i say that , you never see it as anything else again .
did you want it ?
if you need surgery , you want to be operated on by a board-certified surgeon .
let me bring it to you locally .
they have to be able to teach us something as well .
but that &apos;s the lectures .
i feel that i &apos;ve fitted in , in many ways , to some of the things that i &apos;ve heard .
i think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled in intellectual performance is one called ai in japan -- her name means love -- and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her .
but this teaches us a new respect -- and it &apos;s a new respect not only for the chimpanzees , i suggest , but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet .
and that &apos;s not just in the far-away developing world ; that &apos;s everywhere .
because they &apos;re buying into it , and they &apos;re the ones who get to decide what they &apos;re going to do .
it &apos;s what i &apos;m devoting most of my energy to .
really what i &apos;m talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life .
some things are missing .
there &apos;s a protocell ab now in this system .
these are very dirty little protocells , as a matter of fact .
promising to give exhibitions of paintings , i shipped my paints and arrived in mahabalipuram .
we had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
it shifted the earth &apos;s tectonic plates , sped up the planet &apos;s rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
and given this , we started getting questions like , &quot; if you can grow human body parts , can you also grow animal products like meat and leather ? &quot;
the animal could be a cow , lamb , or even something more exotic .
it allows us to be creative .
edward burtynsky : photographing the landscape of oil
there have been three ways to try to impact the brain : the therapist &apos;s couch , pills and the knife .
i &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
but we can ask the obvious question : is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
there are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
in fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
and so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face -- i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
people love their automobiles .
autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head .
we think it &apos;s a question of not whether , but a question of when .
you know , i could be wrong about this , but my sense is that in the public mind , today , that gm is not viewed as serious about some of these environmental ideas as some of your japanese competitors , maybe even as ford .
not so much .
and so every year , i share my background with my kids , because they need to know that everyone has a story , everyone has a struggle , and everyone needs help along the way .
we make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them , and they use all the technology that they &apos;re used to .
in the last few years , i helped two friends have the end of life they wanted .
this is not a plan either ; this is illegal .
here are jim and shirley just after deciding who would take care of their ranch .
now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me , for everyone on this earth .
and maybe by 2020 , you &apos;ll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you &apos;re going to eat .
but first you need to know two things about me .
oh yeah .
all the staff got to know the plucky , young volunteer .
it flips its body 180 degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall .
let me demonstrate how it works .
and they already had a six legged robot called lemur .
this robot is actually a family of snake robots that we call hydras , hyper degrees-of-freedom robotic articulated serpentine .
and now darwin ii is completely autonomous .
all right . so i showed you some of our exciting robots at work .
well , actually , there are two sides to the story .
and it &apos;s very flat . it &apos;s very swampy .
but in the whole county there is no coffee shop , there &apos;s no internet cafe , there &apos;s no movie theater , there &apos;s no bookstore .
over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth , we realized we had fallen in love with the place .
and this also meant the co-creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape .
it also means that designers are no longer consultants , but we &apos;re teachers , and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation .
so what studio h might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way .
designer emily pilloton moved to rural bertie county , in north carolina , to engage in a bold experiment of design-led community transformation . she &apos;s teaching a design-build class called studio h that engages high schoolers &apos; minds and bodies while bringing smart design and new opportunities to the poorest county in the state .
carbon goes back to the atmosphere .
take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here , and i promise you , you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it &apos;s just covered with litter , plant litter .
we &apos;ll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature , and we &apos;ve done so , and look at that .
and there are fallen trees in there now , because the better land is now attracting elephants , etc .
the best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and -- i want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk.as : wonderful .
and , you know , then you get all the way down to people who live in the asia-pacific region , or even more , africa .
so , i don &apos;t know , just stick with me . right ?
this light switch that reads , on the one hand , flashfloods , and on the other hand , off .
all throughout the developing world , people are going directly to cell phones , skipping the whole landline stage .
so you also have the ability for people to start coming together and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways , in ways that haven &apos;t happened before .
it &apos;s the greenest building in the world .
new models for pedagogy for the displaced .
so there &apos;s two bills in congress right now .
but where the dmca was surgical -- we want to go down into your computer , we want to go down into your television set , down into your game machine , and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store -- pipa and sopa are nuclear and they &apos;re saying , we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content .
and then i thought out of curiosity i &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
the education system in india makes you look at paris and new delhi and zurich ; what are you doing in this village ?
you come for the money , you don &apos;t come to barefoot college .
i was in a bit of a spot .
she actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children .
and the girl , who &apos;s on her left , turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said , &quot; please tell her i &apos;m the prime minister . &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll make a concession . i &apos;ll take the husbands along as well . &quot;
they said , &quot; these two grandmothers ... &quot; &quot; grandmothers ? &quot; the minister couldn &apos;t believe what was happening .
i said , &quot; she &apos;ll be happy . she &apos;ll ring you up on the mobile . &quot;
why don &apos;t we start there ?
and i thank god i didn &apos;t know just how huge this man is in the track and field world .
and i went out there and made it to the big east , which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season .
i was the only woman who would be doing the long jump .
i &apos;m sitting there , like , &quot; oh , my god . oh , my god . &quot;
that &apos;s the achievement , i think . that &apos;s the real achievement .
am : in these ?
this is a really basic , basic prosthetic limb under here .
i want to get legs like these made for flat feet so i can wear sneakers , because i can &apos;t with these ones .
higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain .
in a minute we &apos;re going to move to a two-orbital configuration , and you &apos;re going to notice a pulsing .
human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life .
i have that in me that can convert poverty to riches , adversity to prosperity .
he was ultimately exonerated , at the age of 78 , through dna evidence .
well , it &apos;s very simple . what kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it ?
we did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia . these are hospitalized patients .
&quot; yeah , right &quot; is not the right response !
you find a way to be happy with what &apos;s happened .
maybe i left the good one ? &quot; -- have killed themselves .
dan gilbert : the surprising science of happiness
now the only other rule you need to remember is , gamer generation , we like a challenge .
okay . we need to do a last-minute thumb check .
we had some contentment .
the best way to become a legendary grandmaster , you &apos;ve got your two nodes going on .
50 billion dollars of it a year , which is enough , at 30 seconds a ringtone , that could stretch from here to neanderthal times .
night shots are beautiful , piercing the big dipper and the milky way .
these things would drop down from above all through the weekend of rocket launch after rocket launch after rocket launch .
we actually saw seals out of our car window , and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads .
and then i got excited when it started getting tens of hits , and then i started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions .
one , you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever , or two , you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes .
he loved knitting .
there was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches .
life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet .
my most recent book -- my previous book was called &quot; the know-it-all , &quot; and it was about the year i spent reading the encyclopedia britannica from a to z in my quest to learn everything in the world , or more precisely from aak , which is a type of east asian music , all the way to zwyiec , which is -- well , i don &apos;t want to ruin the ending .
so i wanted to follow those .
you donate money to a cause , and you become emotionally involved in that cause .
the first is , thou shalt not take the bible literally .
this one was unexpected because i started the year as an agnostic , and by the end of the year , i became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic , which i love .
and i would say , &quot; but that &apos;s crazy . &quot;
a.j. jacobs : my year of living biblically
on the third day , it was gone .
it &apos;s like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you .
i liked it sighted . it was fine .
if you &apos;re blind , you don &apos;t drive .
so why would i worry ?
because i know our brains are resilient .
but i do know there are three things you can do .
as it turns out , it occurred to tom that a $ 20 helmet is a good way to protect a $ 100,000 graduate education .
this is not accurate , but it did happen to tony blair at the davos forum in 2005 , when his doodles were , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; and he was labeled the following things .
because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form , it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy .
if we apply the best architectural design , climate engineering design , we won &apos;t get much better .
but then we were wondering whether this is a local phenomenon , or is truly global ?
so we said , &quot; what can we do to empower this teacher to do more ? &quot; how to access the digital world ?
so , what we &apos;re going to do is that we &apos;re going to measure a few basic parameters on you , including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that &apos;s there in your blood .
david pogue : the music wars
so , if you look at this image , right away you might be able to see that there are clusters of obese and non-obese people in the image .
what was interesting to us is that the european headline writers had a different take : they said , &quot; are your friends gaining weight ? perhaps you are to blame . &quot;
and so this function of emotions suggests that , in addition to any other purpose they serve , they &apos;re a kind of primitive form of communication .
and notice first of all -- so , to understand this , though , we need to dissect network structure a little bit first -- and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person .
but we also found some non-obvious things .
superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals .
that &apos;s right , older people are happy .
we might spend time with people we don &apos;t even like because it &apos;s somehow interesting .
people are horrible at estimating both of these things , and that &apos;s what i want to talk to you about today .
it &apos;s not interesting because it &apos;s so common .
it &apos;s easy to see leroy getting the check , right ?
why ? because it used to cost 700 , and there &apos;s no way i &apos;m paying 1,500 for something that was 700 last week .
but even when we compare with the possible , instead of the past , we still make certain kinds of mistakes .
nonetheless , their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience .
you go to the stereo store , you see two sets of speakers -- these big , boxy , monoliths , and these little , sleek speakers , and you play them , and you go , you know , i do hear a difference : the big ones sound a little better .
now , why in the world do you get this pattern of results ?
we are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands .
people are being killed for no reason instead of good reason -- as if there &apos;s good reason , but sometimes people think there are .
and so we evolved these responses .
aubrey de grey : my name &apos;s aubrey de grey , from cambridge .
you can see this as early as even in newborn infants .
he jumps back , and he gags , and we had to do it three times , and all three times he gagged .
if you ask enough of these , you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity .
and when we asked them a variety of questions about the rightness or wrongness of certain acts , what we also found was that simply being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them more morally conservative .
and anything you see in the book , you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up .
and it works the exact same way .
and frank , you &apos;ve come to a place in your life , which is astonishing .
i was visiting with an artist , michael heizer , out in the desert near las vegas somewhere .
fg : i don &apos;t really know .
fg : i knew you &apos;d ask that question .
anyway , he &apos;s that kind of patron .
if you don &apos;t meet the budgets , you &apos;re not going to get much work .
bilbao , i think , shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city .
rsw : oh , my god .
so we like pointing out the fact that we &apos;re smart .
how can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two ?
so that &apos;s just what we did .
when they get a hankering for some treats , we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market .
so we said , this looks bad .
now , you &apos;re going to be deciding how you &apos;re going to lose money , but you &apos;re going to get the same choice .
the guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape , so it looks pretty good .
well , what we &apos;ve shown is that , first of all , we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency , and they do very similar things with it .
i &apos;m wearing contact lenses now so that i can see all of you .
and the plastics , we get from oil , which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract .
and sometimes they &apos;ll resort to what &apos;s known as the &quot; burn and sniff &quot; technique where they &apos;ll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic .
even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
my grandfather taught me to work with wood when i was a little boy , and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something , honor that tree &apos;s life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can .
the scale of the challenge for architects and for society to deal with in building is to find a solution to house these people .
we &apos;ve been engineering them with an engineer named eric karsh who works with me on it , and we &apos;ve been doing this new work because there are new wood products out there for us to use , and we call them mass timber panels .
there are models for sustainable forestry that allow us to cut trees properly , and those are the only trees appropriate to use for these kinds of systems .
we &apos;re starting to push the height up of these wood buildings , and we &apos;re hoping , and i &apos;m hoping , that my hometown of vancouver actually potentially announces the world &apos;s tallest at around 20 stories in the not-so-distant future .
in a zippy demo at u , annmarie thomas shows how two different kinds of homemade play dough can be used to demonstrate electrical properties -- by lighting up leds , spinning motors , and turning little kids into circuit designers .
singapore was quite in discussion .
maybe you have this child at home .
and suddenly , the music took off . it took flight .
and then there &apos;s a very small group .
and of course -- -- and of course , if the piece is long and you &apos;ve had a long day , you might actually drift off .
that &apos;s in order to delay -- until act five , he can kill him .
and i &apos;ve one last request before i play this piece all the way through .
i say , &quot; how would you walk ? how would you talk ? how would you be ?
and you know , i have a definition of success .
i want to make a case .
i mean , i &apos;m an american . i believe in free markets .
and so , for tasks like this , a narrow focus , where you just see the goal right there , zoom straight ahead to it , they work really well .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury , some evidence : dan ariely , one of the great economists of our time , he and three colleagues , did a study of some mit students .
mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
it &apos;s pretty . it &apos;s not bad . it &apos;s a huge trademark violation , but it &apos;s pretty clever .
three : the secret to high performance isn &apos;t rewards and punishments , but that unseen intrinsic drive -- the drive to do things for their own sake .
but it doesn &apos;t seem to be working .
so we tell the for-profit sector , &quot; spend , spend , spend on advertising until the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value . &quot;
so amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors , and people had patience .
financial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others so that it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself , and in 400 years , nothing has intervened to say , &quot; that &apos;s counterproductive and that &apos;s unfair . &quot;
net income for breast cancer research went down by 84 percent , or 60 million dollars in one year .
thank you .
so we have this paradox , which is that the number of annual executions has remained high but the number of new death sentences has gone down .
that &apos;s what we do for most problems -- in math and physics , even in social policy -- we slice them into smaller , more manageable problems .
but they did all those things .
we have focused on the problems .
he &apos;d be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice , sustainability and people &apos;s well-being .
and probably the easiest way to show you that , is to show you this graph .
they are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in &#91; the &#93; western world -- a quarter of the resources .
this is what the u.k. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like .
at a business level , you might look at the well-being of your employees , which we know is really linked to creativity , which is linked to innovation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues .
you can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning .
so , you &apos;ve grown up , and reached the age of reason , and now god will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record . &quot;
i just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven , and then you &apos;re capable of committing any and all sins against god and man . &quot; and bill said , &quot; so ? &quot; and then i said , &quot; so , you &apos;re six . you have a whole year to do anything you want to and god won &apos;t notice it . &quot; and he said , &quot; so ? &quot; and i said , &quot; so ? so everything ! &quot; and i turned to run . i was so angry with him .
so , normally i just ignore the doorbell , but on this day i answered .
i said , &quot; what happened to the lamanites ? &quot;
would god force you to get your old nose back ?
and the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience is that our default wiring is to help .
the word is &quot; pizzled &quot; : it &apos;s a combination of puzzled and pissed off .
or we don &apos;t know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient ; it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill ? in other words , we &apos;re oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use .
immediately someone went to get orange juice , someone brought a hotdog , someone brought a subway cop .
and some of that , in fact , is due to the fact that we &apos;ve had an economic recession .
it &apos;s riddled with gimmicks . &quot;
and unfortunately , as you get into that , people get confused and think , well maybe you think that &apos;s okay .
we can get some things out on the internet .
bill gates : how state budgets are breaking us schools
i said , &quot; cancer &apos;s only one page in my life , and i will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life . &quot;
i made that image of durga and her every attribute , her every nuance , my very own .
so i basically roughed out what html should look like : hypertext protocol , http ; the idea of urls , these names for things which started with http .
well , some people did .
because data you can &apos;t naturally use by itself but in fact , data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it .
i wrote an article entitled &quot; linked data &quot; a couple of years ago and soon after that , things started to happen .
that &apos;s important . why is it important ?
so i &apos;m just going to mention a few other thoughts on data .
one last type of data i &apos;ll talk about , maybe it &apos;s the most exciting .
tim berners-lee : the next web
so in the morning , you see which direction the sunflower is facing , and you mark it on the blank area in the base .
jinsop lee : hey , my name &apos;s jinsop , and today , i &apos;m going to show you what riding motorbikes is like from the point of view of the five senses . hey !
and i realized this theory also explains why chris &apos; clock is so much better than mine .
oh , one last thing before i leave .
they dance to son dam bi &apos;s dance on tv , but you can &apos;t even call it son dam bi &apos;s dance -- it becomes the kids &apos; own dance .
the eros between sentences , that is the essence of flaubert &apos;s novel . &quot;
they talk about these kinds of experiences .
&quot; i &apos;m drawing diligently , &quot; i said .
next , a urinal was placed on its side and called &quot; fountain &quot; .
we easily say these sorts of things .
the reason i make them write like crazy is because when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind , the artistic devil creeps in .
so in response to such a pragmatic question , we need to be bold .
young-ha kim : be an artist , right now !
top climate scientist james hansen tells the story of his involvement in the science of and debate over global climate change . in doing so he outlines the overwhelming evidence that change is happening and why that makes him deeply worried about the future .
and you looked at me and said , you have to tell that story .
and i guess it was part of was finding my own voice .
one of the happiest moments i had in this whole journey is , after the book came out , i stood on a stage with john chambers , the ceo of cisco .
ss : and these are people who are meeting every single month .
and i think people don &apos;t fully understand how broad the message is .
pm : thank you , sheryl .
he and i have both been exploring caves a long time and we &apos;ve been climbing mountains a long time , but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before .
brent named this cave pure imagination , i think because the beautiful sights we saw in there were beyond what we could have ever imagined .
you &apos;re not asked .
do you remember the story ? no , it was big .
actually , we lived in a place called snitterfield , just outside stratford , which is where shakespeare &apos;s father was born . are you struck by a new thought ? i was .
children dance all the time if they &apos;re allowed to , we all do .
benign advice -- now , profoundly mistaken . the whole world is engulfed in a revolution .
if my wife is cooking a meal at home -- which is not often , thankfully .
she was eventually auditioned for the royal ballet school ; she became a soloist ; she had a wonderful career at the royal ballet . she eventually graduated from the royal ballet school and founded her own company -- the gillian lynne dance company -- met andrew lloyd weber . she &apos;s been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history ; she &apos;s given pleasure to millions ; and she &apos;s a multi-millionaire . somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down .
it &apos;s still going strong , with positive press to die for .
let &apos;s just say &quot; value for money . &quot;
these comics are now going to the new york festival .
so let me start by taking you back , back into the mists of your memory to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life , but certainly the most anticipated year in all human history : the year 2000 . remember that ?
are you annoyed that i didn &apos;t talk about gender equality or education ?
this openness , this forcing openness , is key , and if it wasn &apos;t entirely transparent already , i should be open : i &apos;ve got a completely transparent agenda .
this must drive you crazy .
heart disease used to be the biggest killer , particularly for men in their 40s .
well , there are probably three reasons .
it &apos;s actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don &apos;t have a brain that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself .
we wait until the behavior becomes manifest .
they come on a weekly basis to durban .
getting a little more technical now .
and the marketing is that not matter how much you &apos;ve invested in your brand , one bad week can undermine decades of good work .
hurdy-gurdy , or wheel fiddle .
and this is a song that has a kind of a celtic feel .
it &apos;s not exactly your choice .
and even if you &apos;ve had pizza with somebody for a very long time , don &apos;t you still say things like , &quot; should we get the usual ? &quot;
if we &apos;re still hungry , we might have some more .
as far as i know , psychophysics is about measuring things .
and that is , that when they analyzed the diet pepsi data , they were asking the wrong question .
and howard looked at their product line , and he said , what you have is a dead tomato society .
in six varieties : cheese , light , robusto , rich &amp; amp ; hearty , old world traditional , extra-chunky garden .
used to be , there were two mustards . french &apos;s and gulden &apos;s .
and she serves it that way time and time again , and if you quarrel with her , she will say , &quot; you know what ? you &apos;re wrong ! this is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant . &quot;
howard not only believed that , but he took it a second step , which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food , we aren &apos;t just making an error ; we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice .
maybe that &apos;s because you don &apos;t actually have acne .
if you develop a disease , you &apos;re off the island .
well , he &apos;s right . i &apos;ve had honest-to-goodness high blood pressure for a dozen years now , same age my father got it , and it &apos;s a real disease . it &apos;s not pre-hypertension , it &apos;s actual hypertension , high blood pressure .
in trying to understand romantic love , i decided i would read poetry from all over the world , and i just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century china , because it &apos;s an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman .
and last but not least , it is an obsession .
people live for love . they kill for love . they die for love .
and i say back into the job market , because this is not new .
but even at menstruation , they &apos;re better than the average man .
and what i really think that we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re moving towards a collaborative society , a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed .
and i looked -- for one of my books , i looked at divorce data in 58 societies .
i want to conclude with a worry -- i have a worry -- and with a wonderful story .
i &apos;m an identical twin ; i am interested in why we &apos;re all alike .
and sure enough -- i &apos;ve never been in one , but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it &apos;s crazy and it &apos;s noisy and it &apos;s exciting .
i thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest ford or lincoln and leave it in the driveway .
and so even at a young age , that really resonated with me , and the whole notion of environmental preservation , at a very basic level , sunk in with me .
but unfortunately , as we &apos;re on our way to solving one monstrous problem -- and as i said , we &apos;re not there yet ; we &apos;ve got a lot of work to do , but i can see where we will -- but even as we &apos;re in the process of doing that , another huge problem is looming , and people aren &apos;t noticing .
and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised .
very soon , the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and gps information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network .
and we need people from all walks of life ; not just inventors , we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they &apos;re going to respond to this challenge .
we &apos;ve heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers .
but we had parents who said , &quot; okay , making our children good human beings is all very well , but what about math and science and english ?
so , you &apos;re getting the pattern . first 200 children at riverside .
first they have cleaned the society , then it will be hyderabad , and soon india .
they don &apos;t like that . they think it &apos;s crank . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s crank .
if we would apply these codes and standards to the pantheon in rome , it would never have looked like this , because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building .
and they really practice what they preach because this office doesn &apos;t have any electric lighting at all .
and i will explain that further .
it only spoils the darkness .
so just to explain .
they are not disturbed anymore .
lighting architect rogier van der heide offers a beautiful new way to look at the world -- by paying attention to light . examples from classic buildings illustrate a deeply thought-out vision of the play of light around us . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i &apos;ve got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control , and this is also with only four leds .
usman riaz + preston reed : a young guitarist meets his hero
sometimes you turn on the news and you say , &quot; is there anyone left to hack ? &quot;
they &apos;re completely anonymous , as it were .
so the family , as the inner core of carderplanet was known , came up with this brilliant idea called the escrow system .
and he did a great job in it .
he combined the tremendous skills of a geek with the suave social engineering skills of the master criminal .
we just never knew how to get there , what we were doing .
every single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease .
huntington , west virginia .
by the way , this is what they get buried in .
the biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on food , food culture , what made our society .
they &apos;re doing their best .
jo : what do you think this is ? i don &apos;t know .
now , i don &apos;t know about you guys , but judging the circumstances , right , any judge in the whole world , would look at the statistics and the evidence , and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse . that &apos;s my belief .
obviously in schools we owe it to them to make sure those 180 days of the year , from that little precious age of four , til 18 , 20 , 24 , whatever , they need to be cooked proper , fresh food from local growers on site . ok ?
the kitchen is 25 grand a month . okay ?
i was worried about vaginas . i was worried what we think about vaginas , and even more worried that we don &apos;t think about them .
in great neck , new york , they call it a &quot; pussy-cat . &quot;
and the third principle of happiness , which i &apos;ve realized recently .
it has taken me , this journey , to islamabad , where i have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off .
she was 21 years old . i went to guatemala and she had sold out the national theater of guatemala .
and i actually made up a little character whose name was mr. alligator , and i would call him up when things got really bad , and i would say it was time to come and pick me up .
every morning we have about 400 patients , maybe more or less .
but we try to stand on our feet , to do something , little things , we can for our people .
they point to the successes of aid : the eradication of smallpox , and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals .
and so , amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves , because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have .
because we &apos;re starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people . all of the ones i discussed have reached at least a quarter million people .
his name was raja , and he had kind , twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father .
just think of all those sunflowers in the desert .
let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s suddenly possible .
since we opened the website in february , we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries .
other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually .
they &apos;re typing their program into the browser , and you can see they didn &apos;t get it quite right , lady liberty is still seasick .
this is the san francisco study group , but there were ones all over the world .
so in a lecture-based class , half the students are above that level and half are below .
first it would establish education as a fundamental human right , where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves , their families and their communities .
or &quot; what kind of medium do you work in ? &quot;
this was in tampa , florida , so i was like , &quot; winter clothes that i have no use for in florida .
but they said , &quot; okay , aside from what we had discussed , do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states ? &quot;
and then i built this over here . let me go back to it over here .
this is me buying some duck flavored paste at the ranch 99 in daly city on sunday , november 15th .
these are some of the meals that i &apos;ve been cooking at home .
the other thing that &apos;s also interesting that &apos;s going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- and it doesn &apos;t matter who they are -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information , or restricted access to information .
you can see the national security agency likes to come by .
after he ended up on a watch list by accident , hasan elahi was advised by his local fbi agents to let them know when he was traveling . he did that and more ... much more .
but on the more unequal end -- u.k. , portugal , usa , singapore -- the differences are twice as big .
it &apos;s simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted .
that relationship is not mainly driven by more crime .
the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bottom , sweden and japan , they &apos;re very different countries in all sorts of ways .
but i should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
i think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can .
this is a high-end . this is what we &apos;d call a &quot; smart knee . &quot;
now this is a video of kamal .
we did a lot of iterations , not just around this , but some other things .
prinima was 18 years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg , and she traveled 12 hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee , and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers , she &apos;s particularly meaningful to me as an engineer and as a woman , because she was in school , she had just started school to study engineering .
usually , dance has a stimulus or stimuli , and i thought i &apos;d take something simple , ted logo , we can all see it , it &apos;s quite easy to work with , and i &apos;m going to do something very simply , where you take one idea from a body , and it happens to be my body , and translate that into somebody else &apos;s body , so it &apos;s a direct transfer , transformation of energy .
okay , you &apos;ve got something ? one more thing .
whoaa . just after it , maybe . whoaa , whaaay , ooh .
just for a second , think about that word &quot; ted &quot; in front of you , so it &apos;s in mind , and it &apos;s there right in front of your mind .
so -- three versions . oh .
it &apos;s beautiful and it &apos;s functional .
it &apos;s so much fun to drive . &quot;
still can &apos;t reach it .
and when people are finished , they don &apos;t throw it away .
and that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing .
so jake cress is this furniture maker , and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture .
and there &apos;s very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there &apos;s a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be .
we made a guess . the guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers .
whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology , the teacher &apos;s first reaction is , you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it &apos;s impossible .
he came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad .
so i said , &quot; but how did you understand what &apos;s going on over there ? &quot;
i &apos;ll leave it at that , because , i mean , it sort of says it all , doesn &apos;t it ?
can technology alter the acquisition of values ?
the 404 page is that .
renny gleeson : you just ... no , he &apos;s not okay .
and yet , at the end , it &apos;s so hard to change a wall .
and yet it is in times like this that i think architecture can thrive with big ideas , ideas that are not small . think of the great cities .
you know the soviet architecture of that building is the conservation .
our whole practice depends on computing .
and i do believe that this interaction with the history , with history that is often very difficult , to grapple with it , to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique .
what is raw ? the raw , i would say is the naked experience , untouched by luxury , untouched by expensive materials , untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture .
it tells a story . the story can reach into obscure desires .
these are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us , but are important for everybody in this world .
and ground zero , despite all its difficulties , it &apos;s moving forward .
now i happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that &apos;s a good thing .
i kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders .
the cuban missile crisis , jfk is shot , the civil rights movement , race riots , the vietnam war , mlk is shot , bobby kennedy is shot , watergate .
comfort is no longer why we watch television .
well , as we say in the business , x marks the spot .
the 1950s : june cleever in the original comfort show , &quot; leave it to beaver . &quot;
if you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car , you get about 20 percent efficiency .
em : in creating an electric car , the responsiveness of the car is really incredible .
so if you start a trip at 9 a.m. , by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat , hit the restroom , coffee , and keep going .
so therefore , the key thing to do is to get the cost of that initial installation low , and then get the cost of the financing low , because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar .
em : more from solar than any other source .
nasa has been doing this for years . how have you done this ?
so progress on this &quot; let &apos;s make it reusable , &quot; how is that going ? that was just a simulation video we saw .
well , i do think there &apos;s a good framework for thinking .
and then she clarified . she said , &quot; you know what , i don &apos;t mean that it sucks . it means that i didn &apos;t understand a word of it .
when a secret agent virus infects a bacterium , they do a little espionage .
well , a very tiny fraction of them don &apos;t .
leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point .
on the outside it looks like a very typical garage , a nice garage .
but you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside .
my talk today is about the main reason , or one of the main reasons , why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way , shape or form .
others overcome their self at raves .
now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years , but it &apos;s about to make a major comeback this year , especially after e.o. wilson &apos;s book comes out in april , making a very strong case that we , and several other species , are products of group selection .
it &apos;s not that hard a problem .
politics is partly profane , it &apos;s partly about self-interest , but politics is also about sacredness .
when you are happy , you are grateful .
you have no way of assuring that there will be another moment given to you , and yet , that &apos;s the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us , this moment , with all the opportunity that it contains .
that &apos;s an opportunity that is given to us .
so i put little stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet , and every time i turned it on , water .
a grateful world is a world of joyful people .
but time is a factor .
anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests .
daniel suarez : the kill decision shouldn &apos;t belong to a robot
what are its tendencies over time ? one way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms , which we &apos;ve heard a lot about .
and here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time , we have it coming out from the center .
that we see there &apos;s a general hammer , and hammers become more and more specific over time .
when something is extinct , you can &apos;t have it as your parent .
and when we take that , we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again , in life &apos;s evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they &apos;re really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens .
and i think it &apos;s really important . because if you can imagine mozart before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be .
tech enthusiast kevin kelly asks &quot; what does technology want ? &quot; and discovers that its movement toward ubiquity and complexity is much like the evolution of life .
in fact -- seriously .
but i began to ask questions and search out the usual things that i had been exploring before , like , what do the maps look like ?
and so what we decided to do in the year 2000 is kind of put this together in a way by hiring in new categories of workers , the first being violence interruptors .
what do you mean , hiring people who have backgrounds ?
physician gary slutkin spent a decade fighting tuberculosis , cholera and aids epidemics in africa . when he returned to the united states , he thought he &apos;d escape brutal epidemic deaths . but then he began to look more carefully at gun violence , noting that its spread followed the patterns of infectious diseases . a mind-flipping look at a problem that too many communities have accepted as a given . we &apos;ve reversed the impact of so many diseases , says slutkin , and we can do the same with violence .
so i tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers .
there is no photoshop involved .
after the breathtaking green-haired rosa is murdered , the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians &apos; paste .
where was wislawa szymborska during all this ?
or you can go to the random house website where there is this excerpt .
first of all , electric fields are not an electric current that is coursing through the tissue .
when we apply the fields -- again , in the identical time-scale to the identical culture -- you &apos;re going to see something different .
that cloudy white mass that you see is the recurrence of the tumor .
you can see the tumor treating field field generator , but importantly you can also see that she is living her life .
and i just ate it up .
but i feel blessed to be able to work with them .
but even beyond that , coming back to the internet , what you can actually see is that certain governments have mastered the use of cyberspace for propaganda purposes . right ?
we tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships , but in many cases it only strengthens them .
now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their facebook page .
that &apos;s where all these problems come from .
that &apos;s the quest .
but you know , at a local level , you scale ; everybody in this room is scaled .
something else is going on .
and here &apos;s scaling of cities .
because they think that all those wonderful things -- like creative people , wealth , income -- is what attracts them , forgetting about the ugly and the bad .
so the image is that we &apos;re not only on a treadmill that &apos;s going faster , but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster .
physicist geoffrey west has found that simple , mathematical laws govern the properties of cities -- that wealth , crime rate , walking speed and many other aspects of a city can be deduced from a single number : the city &apos;s population . in this mind-bending talk from tedglobal he shows how it works and how similar laws hold for organisms and corporations .
they invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well , and really had this robust experiential learning .
nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer , but they were into it . and i asked them to put their own voice over it .
go create . go figure it out .
and everything that everybody is talking about today isn &apos;t possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities , because we won &apos;t get there with a standardized test , and we won &apos;t get there with a culture of one right answer .
sit down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a -- &quot; what ?
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys .
for everybody else , we go around like we &apos;ve been having sex since we were two .
this fear , getting outside the man box , totally enveloped me .
the disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . the shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face : no medicine , no pills , no injections .
diabetes , cancer , parkinson &apos;s , alzheimer &apos;s , heart failure , lung failure -- things that we know are debilitating diseases , for which there &apos;s relatively little that can be done .
many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life , and reducing poverty , and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe .
one thing you can do is not treat . you can ration health care .
but it &apos;s applicable , again , to every organ system .
he asked the question , if i take that material , which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine , and i place it somewhere else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tissue-specific response , or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear ?
darpa just gave steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question .
we need all sorts of new technology , new devices , to get the cells to the right place at the right time .
this is equally tragic .
china just launched a national tissue-engineering center .
but i said we can &apos;t get rid of it , because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can &apos;t get rid of that immunity .
and i &apos;m making an aptamer that will have this attached to it .
today , though , i &apos;m going to talk about darwin &apos;s other strange inversion , which is equally puzzling at first , but in some ways just as important .
it was a hyperstimulus for them , and they loved it .
thank you very much .
and in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t-shirt i say , &quot; yes , we can talk about this issue .
and in this way , i &apos;ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
that round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of avelile .
or they &apos;re responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many , or most , of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question .
the reality is that even in democratic societies today , we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks .
the most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the internet evolves in a citizen-centric manner .
in this powerful talk from tedglobal , rebecca mackinnon describes the expanding struggle for freedom and control in cyberspace , and asks : how do we design the next phase of the internet with accountability and freedom at its core , rather than control ? she believes the internet is headed for a &quot; magna carta &quot; moment when citizens around the world demand that their governments protect free speech and their right to connection .
it didn &apos;t help .
i learned that success isn &apos;t a one-way street .
and the soprano section is just full of hot girls . &quot;
so i wrote on my blog , &quot; omg omg . &quot;
and scott aggregated all of the videos .
and there were 900 people involved in that .
it wasn &apos;t a virtual choir .
there are a couple of these kinds of eco-dashboards right now -- so dashboards built into cars which try to motivate you to drive more fuel efficiently .
and he put that in the word &quot; arete , &quot; which we , from the &#91; ancient greek &#93; , translate as &quot; virtue . &quot;
what does your chair say about what you value ? designer sebastian deterding shows how our visions of morality and what the good life is are reflected in the design of objects around us . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
the idea is very , very simple .
and gallery one is an interesting project because it started with this massive , $ 350 million expansion for the cleveland museum of art , and we actually brought in this piece specifically to grow new capacity , new audiences , at the same time that the museum itself is growing .
but that was coupled together with this oral histories booth , really the simplest we &apos;ve ever made , where you locate yourself on a map .
voice 15 : so i switched on the television .
the original designer of the memorial , michael arad , had this image in his mind of all the names appearing undifferentiated , almost random , really a poetic reflection on top of the nature of a terrorism event itself , but it was a huge challenge for the families , for the foundation , certainly for the first responders , and there was a negotiation that went forth and a solution was found to actually create not an order in terms of chronology , or in terms of alphabetical , but through what &apos;s called meaningful adjacency .
and there are two things that are primary in a politician &apos;s heart : one is reputation and influence .
i know these are tough , and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it , but this is actually critical .
you &apos;re going to do that by the way you sign your letter .
and so anytime i talk about what i do , i like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter .
and it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards .
but really the most satisfying experience i &apos;ve had is the act of listening , which is what we need in any good relationship .
it becomes a little bit more difficult when i only have one foot on the ground and when i don &apos;t use my hands .
will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry ?
we can change this behavior , however .
raffaello d &apos;andrea : the astounding athletic power of quadcopters
that is , at best , i was expected to live in a board and care , and work at menial jobs .
it &apos;s a flat surface . it &apos;s safe . &apos; rebel and val followed and they asked what had gotten into me .
they &apos;re different from me and you .
i could get you admitted right away , and the whole thing could be very discrete . &apos; &apos; ha , ha , ha .
so would i take the pill ? in an instant .
it &apos;s the perfect driving mechanism .
this is a river .
it &apos;s a broken system .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening here .
they &apos;re completely flat , and they &apos;re basically cardboard characters .
fifteen-year-old tavi gevinson had a hard time finding strong female , teenage role models -- so she built a space where they could find each other . at tedxteen , she illustrates how the conversations on sites like rookie , her wildly popular web magazine for and by teen girls , are putting a new , unapologetically uncertain and richly complex face on modern feminism . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century effectively poisoned the water supply of london much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing .
and they had already started building the sewers in london , and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water .
my dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime -- and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale .
so in other words , it almost always starts from the bottom up .
and there is a motivational component , which is , &quot; i want to help you . &quot;
this awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in .
imagine whenever you meet any other person , any time you meet a person , your habitual , instinctive first thought is , &quot; i want you to be happy .
first is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide .
or a woman , i picked up her baby , really cute baby , i said &quot; your baby is so cute . &quot;
and there are many reasons why i believe it &apos;s possible .
so , you know , there &apos;s bars . and by the time that vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? your head gets bigger .
that hit me so hard , telling these people that had been through this experience .
this is yadira , and yadira is five years old . she &apos;s in a tribe that &apos;s neighboring the huaorani .
that was one of the big motivating factors .
organizing a marathon in lebanon is definitely not like organizing one in new york .
you know , the marathon has really become one of a kind .
and so the question is : how did that material get here ?
and the moon is only two seconds away , so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light , it &apos;s the moon two seconds ago , and who cares .
and that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe .
now we &apos;re going to fly through it at warp a million .
and it &apos;s grown up in some kind of way .
i like to build stuff .
she told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia .
one of the things which my intern here , pratesh , built is a mobile application , which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go .
in fact , we spend more time looking after our cars , our clothes and our hair than we — okay , maybe not our hair , but you see where i &apos;m going .
by that i mean not being lost in thought , not being distracted , not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions , but instead learning how to be in the here and now , how to be mindful , how to be present .
you go back to it , repeat it . &quot; oh , i am worried .
but first , i need to talk to you about a story , which is my story , about the story of this country that you &apos;re all here in today .
so that is the chapter two : the oil era .
how could we survive that ?
we import 90 percent of our food , and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land .
our objective is to be a millennium city , just like many millennium cities around : istanbul , rome , london , paris , damascus , cairo .
how long was mubarak in power ? 31 .
if you maintain nonviolent discipline , you will exclusively win .
arrest the shoppers with kids ? doesn &apos;t make sense .
srdja popovic : how to topple a dictator
then we &apos;d have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape ? &quot;
and so many of the calls went like this , &quot; hey , dr. brown . we loved your tedtalk .
it &apos;s the best way to shut people down on an airplane .
you know what the big secret about ted is ?
us .
shame feels the same for men and women , but it &apos;s organized by gender .
and to get out from underneath it , to find our way back to each other , we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we &apos;re parenting , the way we &apos;re working , the way we &apos;re looking at each other .
the shake developed out of , really , a single-minded pursuit of pointillism , just years of making tiny , tiny dots .
and i was in a dark place for a long time , unable to create .
i looked for temporary materials , like spitting out food -- — sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine .
phil hansen : embrace the shake
others have a few residents in them , one or two &quot; babushkas , &quot; or &quot; babas , &quot; which are the russian and ukrainian words for grandmother .
now , like many of you , i have moved maybe 20 , 25 times in my life .
so we bring a team together .
also , we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency .
and some people think that &apos;s a good thing .
one , that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be ; two , that we will always be heard ; and three , that we will never have to be alone .
create sacred spaces at home -- the kitchen , the dining room -- and reclaim them for conversation .
as humans , we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy .
as humans , we are social , we are empathic , and that &apos;s great .
i realized i &apos;d internalized these responses and it had changed who i was on a core level .
and i knew how mr. webster defined it : as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige , or something of that sort -- worthy accomplishments perhaps , but in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success .
coal oil lamp -- we didn &apos;t have electricity in our farm home .
so i let them -- just they had to be neat and clean .
and those actually came from my dad .
&quot; sometimes i think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can &apos;t win , is the fates themselves that miss .
i believe it was -- one great philosopher said -- no , no , cervantes . cervantes said , &quot; the journey is better than the end . &quot;
and you know one of them was a starting player for a season and a half .
or we can use cells alone , either your very own cells or different stem cell populations .
this is actually a biomaterial .
another technology that we have used in patients actually involves bladders .
and this is actually a piece of bone that i &apos;m going to show you in this slide that was actually created with this desktop printer and implanted as you see here .
this actually shows the actual printer .
i felt so sick .
i was a little kid , and i was like , &quot; yeah . i &apos;ll have that . i &apos;ll have that surgery . &quot;
now you may have noticed there &apos;s a new sector emerging called swap-trading .
now , you know when you learn a new word , and then you start to see that word everywhere ?
i generally believe we &apos;re at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors -- through sites such as flickr and twitter that are becoming second nature online -- are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives .
so i want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors .
now all of these systems require a degree of trust , and the cornerstone to this working is reputation .
stayed when everybody else was dropping out .
the man on top can see , the blind man can walk .
when i was about three or four years old , and my two big brothers , and i remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book , to feel the picture they were discussing .
as one of them said to me , &quot; ron , we ain &apos;t going anywhere at the moment . &quot;
in 1974 , the great ray kurzweil , the american inventor , worked on building a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech .
and one of my most enduring memories is in 1999 , mary reading to me and the children down near manly beach &quot; harry potter and the philosopher &apos;s stone . &quot;
i wonder what the future will hold .
it will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 .
ladies and gentlemen , i present to you the human genome .
world population , pc placements , the archive of all the medical literature , moore &apos;s law , the old way of sequencing , and here &apos;s all the new stuff .
so unfortunately , this doesn &apos;t help this woman , but it does have severe , profound if you will , implications to her family .
but the gene that regulates that down is broken .
thankfully , i was able to answer a , and i say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening .
and if we both say yes , voila ! welcome to chromosomally linkedin .
this is the best economic news on the planet these days .
so this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about .
but over the longer term , if we are moving into an economy that &apos;s heavy on technology and light on labor , and we are , then we have to consider some more radical interventions , for example , something like a guaranteed minimum income .
and then we &apos;re off to the races , because i don &apos;t believe for a second that we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges or that we have become too apathetic or hard-hearted to even try .
so i &apos;m thinking , you know , this procedure hasn &apos;t changed in about 40 years .
they &apos;ve got great potential but haven &apos;t yet entered clinical trials .
this is not a story of a nameless survivor of war , and nameless refugees , whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv with tattered clothes , dirty face , scared eyes .
a palestinian woman once told me , &quot; it is not about the fear of one death , &quot; she said , &quot; sometimes i feel i die 10 times in one day , &quot; as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets .
that was her resistance .
there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don &apos;t start investing in women and girls .
i humbly add -- humbly add -- that out beyond the worlds of war and peace , there is a field , and there are many women and men &#91; who &#93; are meeting there .
this quantum weirdness was first described by erwin schrödinger and his cat .
this is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting .
and it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles .
they tell us what interactions are allowed to happen .
a physicist looks for larger , more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset .
and this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new .
this way , even if the physics i work on comes to nothing , i still know i &apos;ve lived a good life .
but a string theorist , as i understand it , explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating -- i know you don &apos;t like string theory -- vibrating inside it .
mr. wurzel . the female has her first baby when she &apos;s 11 or 12 .
there isn &apos;t time to go into it , but it &apos;s including things like tree nurseries , methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded , almost desert-like land up in these mountains .
and what &apos;s happened ? i mean , the question here is , here we are , arguably the most intelligent being that &apos;s ever walked planet earth , with this extraordinary brain , capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these ted conferences , and yet we &apos;re destroying the only home we have .
shoots seem tiny ; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall .
and of course , there &apos;s hope . one is this amazing human brain .
people like this are the role models we need for young africans .
and so in my life , i &apos;ve discovered that vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over-achiever .
but in reality , the sky looked like this . it was a beautiful , complex sky .
so often , seven days a week . family business equals child labor .
and because of that , i always wondered about this human thing .
i feel kind of bad about that .
shortly after this , 9 / 11 happened , and i was very depressed .
so , i thought , maybe i &apos;ll do this for the next twenty years or something .
ok . it gets them to work harder , sometimes .
and we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him .
you can get video annotations of the event that you &apos;re reading about you can get the latest sports scores etc .
i then , in the last few years , learned about the pacific garbage patch and the gyre .
so this is a big issue for us .
but , as important as it is to change the lightbulbs , it is more important to change the laws .
the extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much . it comes back in the winter , but not as permanent ice , as thin ice -- vulnerable . the amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years .
this is gasoline consumption in all of these countries . and us .
the only two countries that didn &apos;t ratify -- and now there &apos;s only one . australia had an election .
let &apos;s do that . thank you very much .
buckminster fuller once wrote , &quot; if the future of all human civilization depended on me , what would i do ?
i was still in deep grief ; i knew i didn &apos;t have the strength .
so that &apos;s why i decided to tell my story , so that my suffering is something positive for other women .
i never had met someone with such a hard life , from such a totally different culture and environment from my own .
but they just don &apos;t seem to get through .
okay , i &apos;m going to give you a bit of a demonstration .
okay , so i &apos;m going to take this really filthy water , and put it in here . do you want a drink yet ?
they can make their own sterile drinking water , and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives .
too much of the world lacks access to clean drinking water . engineer michael pritchard did something about it -- inventing the portable lifesaver filter , which can make the most revolting water drinkable in seconds . an amazing demo from tedglobal 2009 .
the globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets , but actually it &apos;s the globalization of real power .
the g20 : we know now that we have to put together an institution which is capable of bringing governance to that financial space for financial speculation .
europe in the 19th century : a great british foreign secretary , lord canning , used to describe it as the &quot; european concert of powers . &quot;
people say to me , &quot; the chinese , of course , they &apos;ll never get themselves involved in peace-making , multilateral peace-making around the world . &quot;
because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself , nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory , because the effects outside the nation state are now beginning to affect what happens inside them .
peace has come to northern ireland because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn &apos;t work .
so what i started thinking was , perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .
we didn &apos;t really understand that .
and it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stronger enemy .
thank you .
so to make it to age 100 , you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle , you also have to have won the genetic lottery .
that &apos;s called the grandmother effect .
they call it a moai . and if you &apos;re in a moai you &apos;re expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck , and if things go bad , child gets sick , parent dies , you always have somebody who has your back .
adventists also tend to hang out with other adventists .
sardinians live in vertical houses , up and down the stairs .
instead , if your friend &apos;s idea of recreation is physical activity , bowling , or playing hockey , biking or gardening , if your friends drink a little , but not too much , and they eat right , and they &apos;re engaged , and they &apos;re trusting and trustworthy , that is going to have the biggest impact over time .
and yet , if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings , i wouldn &apos;t be doing my job -- because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen , that practicalities are seen to .
there is something more though that has to be there .
and they say &quot; it &apos;s 18 minutes . &quot;
meanwhile , the rich man thinks to himself , &quot; i &apos;m an idiot . god wants bread ?
and then i have to try to see in what ways i can make these the hands of god .
smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities .
just like jordan and so many other makers , hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them .
please keep your seat .
and when you turn the switch on , the light goes on .
but the future is actually even brighter .
it came in on a friday night .
now , when these things blow up , they &apos;re not going to do global ecological damage .
-- you can &apos;t plan that kind of stuff -- apophis is going to hit us . and it &apos;s 250 meters across , so it would do unbelievable damage .
now we have three years to do something else .
this happened to them .
and he wanted to go .
and we did a fourth , and a fifth and a sixth .
they could have a mental image of the cell as a large , bustling , hugely complicated city that &apos;s occupied by micro-machines .
and think about some of the things that we &apos;re learning about cellular mechanics .
my freelance job ended . and i had to get a full-time job to pay the bills .
i spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression .
by the summer of the following year i was a working journalist .
seven children per family -- tremendous growth at 3.3 percent .
it &apos;s been blessed . &quot;
and then we thought we &apos;d help america , because america &apos;s been helping everyone , whether they want help or not .
and after i gave them statistics , they said , &quot; yes . okay . you can use all the radio stations , television stations . &quot;
in every country , every program , you need a symbol , and this is probably the best thing he &apos;s ever done with his mba .
90 percent of the funding came from thailand .
so anyone sitting in and watching tv , get in touch with me .
and as it turns out , that &apos;s a really hard problem , because you have to build a small , portable robot that &apos;s not only really affordable , but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids .
and in the same way that you scroll through content on an ipad , i can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device .
and then if you have something you &apos;re proud of , you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world .
actually , i wasn &apos;t even sure that i could go around the stadium without a walker .
when she was 14 years old , her grandfather sold her to a brothel .
by the way , 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls .
they have no education and no freedom .
the day before , her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him .
i have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart .
we &apos;ll be talking about them .
and suppose they have , you know , very different sensory apparatus , and so on .
but other times they &apos;re not , and you have only probabilities for different outcomes .
symmetry is very important in this discussion .
but chen ning yang , called by us &quot; frank &quot; yang -- -- and bob mills put forward , 50 years ago , this generalization of maxwell &apos;s equations , with a new symmetry .
now , who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind ?
thank you very much .
and of course it &apos;s not just religious people who believe in the golden rule .
the same applies to educators .
not only the jews , he &apos;d taken the temple vessels .
it can only be jehovah .
as you &apos;re thinking , this is a toy model of something like selling in the stock market during a rising market . right ?
there &apos;s a spike at 33 . those are people doing one step .
the reason is , they &apos;re treating other people like a computer , and the brain is too .
that &apos;s an interesting difference , as you might imagine .
there &apos;s a lot more arrows .
you can see they &apos;re very blasé and kind of effortless .
game theoretically , that should actually make the mismatcher &apos;s behavior shift , because what happens is , the mismatcher will think , oh , this guy &apos;s going to go for the big reward , and so i &apos;m going to go to the right , make sure he doesn &apos;t get it .
i got a d in pottery , which was the one thing that i did get -- which was useful , obviously .
that might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces -- if we did it just for a day .
could you give me a flight ? because we &apos;re going to go see him . &quot;
i &apos;ve recorded 44,000 young people .
kofi annan invited me on the morning of september the 11th to do a press conference .
and after lots and lots of meetings obviously , i &apos;m delighted that this man , ahmad fawzi , one of my heroes and mentors really , he managed to get unicef involved .
there was an interest in what was going on .
and then that year , that year , 2008 , this isaf statement from kabul , afghanistan , september 17th : &quot; general stanley mcchrystal , commander of international security assistance forces in afghanistan , announced today isaf will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of september . &quot;
we &apos;ll utilize sport and football .
jeremy gilley : one day of peace
each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that , checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor .
so the last project i &apos;ll show is called biased chains , and it &apos;s probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems .
i started a collaboration with a friend of mine , bart hess -- he doesn &apos;t normally look like this -- and we used ourselves as models .
he was later , it &apos;s said , the basis of the indiana jones character .
we know it &apos;s not anything that we &apos;ve seen before ; it &apos;s sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information .
but it was a terrific job .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
so we chose a small spot in the garden .
it was the easiest way .
and then the surprise turns into hope .
i never miss a single training session .
but we &apos;re still nowhere near a typical place in the universe .
well , one thing that &apos;s true about stephen hawking &apos;s remark -- i mean , it is true , but it &apos;s the wrong emphasis . one thing that &apos;s true about it is that it doesn &apos;t do it with any special physics . there &apos;s no special dispensation , no miracles involved . it does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance .
martin rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things , from astrophysics , to scientific experiments gone wrong , and most importantly to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction .
and with problems that we are not aware of yet , the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope , not just of solving problems , but of survival .
that &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human eyes .
quite empty frames .
he &apos;s well educated , he &apos;s smart , he knows what sylvia browne is doing but he doesn &apos;t give a damn .
i think that something needs to be done about this .
philip zimbardo : let &apos;s tune into the conversation of the principals in adam &apos;s temptation .
and you do it automatically and non-consciously .
and moderate on present-hedonism .
and actually , it &apos;s the model that we expect to work for delivering anesthesia in these environments .
it &apos;s not just inappropriate , it becomes really unsafe .
voila !
it &apos;s also designed for the environment that it will be used in .
the idea , the dream , was really for a sort of bauhaus sort of school where new ideas were interrogated and investigated , the creation of a new visual language based on the african creative heritage .
thank you very much .
simple .
or this ?
and if nasa doesn &apos;t do it , china might , or somebody in this room might write a big check .
and it is a body that has long intrigued people who &apos;ve watched the planets .
and what you see is bright and dark regions , and that &apos;s about as far as it got for us .
and they converge into this channel here , which drains into this region .
so again , it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid , until finally , we saw lakes in the polar regions .
it is precious , it is unique , it is still , so far , the only home we &apos;ve ever known .
but that means you can take a typical bar scene like this , take a picture , say , of this guy right here , get the name , and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody , because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos .
she &apos;d run ahead , and he &apos;d roll a little golden apple .
maps matter .
so i &apos;m here today to talk about the power of attention , the power of your attention , and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the west bank , gaza and elsewhere -- but today , my case study is going to be palestine .
it &apos;s like fallujah . shooting everywhere .
they were going to be surrounded , lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access , either to the west bank or jerusalem .
year after year , after year , after year , they &apos;re more innovative than all their competition .
by &quot; why , &quot; i mean : what &apos;s your purpose ?
totally different right ? you &apos;re ready to buy a computer from me .
our newest brain , our homo sapien brain , our neocortex , corresponds with the &quot; what &quot; level .
and samuel pierpont langley had , what we assume , to be the recipe for success .
he could have said , &quot; that &apos;s an amazing discovery , guys , and i will improve upon your technology , &quot; but he didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation .
and , by the way , he gave the &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech , not the &quot; i have a plan &quot; speech .
we think that it &apos;s a hotel , a hotel with lots of rats .
i &apos;m going to tell you about one more formerly homeless member of our family .
jh : because if the power went out , there would just be a big noise .
jh : that &apos;s fantastic .
and then there are all these forms that we don &apos;t know what they are , but they &apos;re equally well-resolved and complex .
it &apos;s a terrific studio assistant .
so how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment ?
so the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one .
