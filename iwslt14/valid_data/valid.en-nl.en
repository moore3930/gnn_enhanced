and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to preserve when we say , &quot; save the ocean . heal the ocean . &quot;
adult males : a huge load .
we sent a very polite letter to the minister of health in japan and simply pointed out that this is an intolerable situation , not for us , but for the people of japan because mothers who may be breastfeeding , who may have young children , would be buying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really toxic .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
monterey is one of those .
hahahaha .
bj : his mother was a puppeteer .
so we began with a test .
the choreographer , toby sedgwick , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse , which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs , grew up into the big horse .
he has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand .
ak : other emotional stuff .
let &apos;s start with day and night .
until midnight and then again , they sleep from about 2 : 00 a.m. until sunrise .
this is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
giveindia is for a whole country .
now , what &apos;s really interesting here is that we &apos;re not thinking our way into a new way of acting ; we &apos;re acting our way into a new way of thinking .
and they were great community leaders .
but he actually talks to , has two-way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender .
and then there is the third couple . they are two friends .
and of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concentrate and focus your attention .
behind issues of security and safety , which have always been the arguments for social control , in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who , in fact , has a right to self determine their attention , to decide , whether they should , or not , be isolated .
but this is p1 . it &apos;s an entirely student-built electric vehicle , which through using its rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steer-by-wire can drift around corners .
now , the corkscrew is a chicane , followed by a quick right-handed turn as the road drops three stories .
that would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans .
their spending loads , loads , to channel that rainwater out into the ocean when it rains and floods as well .
now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals , and it gives them a lot of misery .
and when the cheapest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs , you &apos;re left with unemployed people , and those people aren &apos;t cheap .
this is smart infrastructure .
and it &apos;s about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear .
but since then , the park that was just a dump and was featured at a ted2006 talk became this little thing .
he said to me something that just went completely over my head .
this picture was taken in 1982 , just before the ibm pc was even announced .
whether we sell , it doesn &apos;t make any difference whatsoever .
and the reason i think design matters isn &apos;t because i wanted to go to art school .
yes , you &apos;re right . he &apos;s right . it &apos;s amharic , it &apos;s ethiopian . in ethiopia , there &apos;s never been a keyboard .
add up all those countries , it didn &apos;t quite get to thing , so we said , &quot; let &apos;s start a program in the united states . &quot; so , end of august , early september , we decide to do this . we announced it near the middle , end -- just when the clinton initiative was taking place .
but a million a month in laptop-land is a big number .
and i really wanted it to be an open project , because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the united states right now and could possibly become another area like monsanto , where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people &apos;s food .
in our culture , it is better to be a tester who supports someone else &apos;s idea than it is to be just the idea guy .
and on the left there is a platform from evolution robotics , where you put a pc on , and you program this thing with a gui to wander around your house and do various stuff .
but we had to make it fairly robust , much more robust than the robots we build in our labs .
and over the next couple of months , we &apos;re going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground .
there was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing , and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end .
do you really think so ?
we got a bunch of naive subjects in , we didn &apos;t tell them anything about the robot , sat them down in front of the robot and said , talk to the robot .
and it &apos;s moving forward , you know , propelled by various charges , and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect .
both parties absolutely need to resolve it , but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it .
we can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap , especially if we raise taxes on the rich .
the rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated .
now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
so what we have , then , when you think about the fiscal cliff , don &apos;t think of it as the american people fundamentally can &apos;t stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate warring nations .
when i was little -- and by the way , i was little once -- my father told me a story about an 18th century watchmaker .
i thought , well what the hell &apos;s that about ?
these are the bits , the pleasure centers , and maybe what i &apos;m seeing and sensing and feeling is bypassing my thinking .
stop . stop . how do you feel ?
and also triumph , this sense of transcendence , this &quot; i never knew that . ah , this is something new . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to shamelessly expose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
and to cap it all , brand royalty -- agusta , count agusta , from the great histories of this stuff .
it &apos;s lovely because it is an embodiment of something refreshing and delicious .
we are slaves to the first few fractions of a second -- and that &apos;s where much of my work has to win or lose , on a shelf in a shop .
thank you very much .
it &apos;s almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff , or you reject the doctrine and you &apos;re living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of cnn and walmart .
let &apos;s look to the plays of shakespeare , the dialogues of plato , the novels of jane austen .
if you said to a modern liberal individualist , &quot; hey , how about a sermon ? &quot;
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
at the end of a really rousing paragraph , they &apos;ll all stand up , and they &apos;ll go , &quot; thank you jesus , thank you christ , thank you savior . &quot;
now i think that the potential is there , but we &apos;ve completely let ourselves down .
all works of art are talking to us about things .
we need to group together .
and i go , &quot; no . &quot; why does that sense of mystery , that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe , need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling ?
they &apos;ve ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement .
all the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we &apos;re all made of -- and that &apos;s four percent of the universe .
it &apos;s about 40 to 50 km wide in most places , and one to two kilometers deep .
and you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called the overwhelmingly large telescope .
this hut was built by robert falcon scott and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole .
and remember , all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub-zero temperatures .
it &apos;s kind of an inspiring statement , and i &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
that &apos;s pretty neat .
this is just before he got kicked out by the parks services , for competing with the bookstore there .
we &apos;re in good enough shape .
and we &apos;ve been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume .
so , we can do 10 cents a page , we &apos;re going 15,000 books a month and we &apos;ve got about 250,000 books online , counting all the other projects that are starting to add in .
but half of those were indian .
well , we &apos;re best known as the world wide web .
carnegie -- one of the great capitalists of this country -- carved above his legacy , &quot; free to the people . &quot;
the price ?
this holds up to 30,000 times its mass .
this is photomicrographs from nick read and patrick hickey .
how is that possible ?
i couldn &apos;t miss it . it was 2,200 acres in size : 2,200 acres in size , 2,000 years old .
these are gateway species , vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities .
10 or greater are considered to be very active .
one week later , i had no sawdust piles whatsoever .
i add mycelium to it , and then i inoculate the corncobs .
so biosphere 2 was essentially a three-acre , entirely sealed , miniature world that i lived in for two years and 20 minutes .
will it work ? or will something happen that we can &apos;t understand and we can &apos;t fix , thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres ?
we were taking their biomass , storing them in the basement , growing plants , going around , around , around , trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .
except that i knew i could walk out the airlock door at any time , if it really got bad , though who was going to say , &quot; i can &apos;t take it anymore ! &quot; ?
not only that , but i lost touch of where my food came from .
in this case it was oilseed .
and i think often times people get lost in that .
now we may not all have another biosphere that we can run to , and compare it to this biosphere .
and the answer is yes and no ; it &apos;s deeper than all of that .
we have now found treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
there &apos;s another sign that we need pit crews , and that &apos;s the unmanageable cost of our care .
you have to become really interested in data , unsexy as that sounds .
not for the lowest people on the totem pole , but for the folks who were all the way around the chain , the entire team including the surgeons .
i met an actual cowboy , by the way .
and one documentary writer , who was here and looked at this two months after i was here , described this not as beehives but as a graveyard , with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .
if this was a group of beekeepers , you would have everyone from the card-carrying nra member who &apos;s , you know , live free or die , to the , you know , the self-expressed quirky san francisco backyard pig farmer .
they all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there . and it &apos;s a great experience , and i really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time , because that &apos;s quite essential american experience .
thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950 .
and that is , make meadows and not lawns .
and if we want to cure ourselves of ndd , or nature deficit disorder , i think this is a great way of doing it .
so my sister-in-law asked me a few times , &quot; please stop whistling . &quot;
okay , i &apos;m not the only one whistling here .
okay .
the &quot; homo studiosus &quot; -- the studying man .
this has been something that has been refused for centuries , despite the evidence .
now with the pollination , it &apos;s a very serious issue for plants , because they move the pollen from one flower to the other , yet they cannot move from one flower to the other .
we have almost 14 million roots .
they have computing power , they have electrical signals .
she goes back to reading her book , which is unfortunately titled &quot; rape . &quot;
it &apos;s a prank , but it &apos;s a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell .
so then i gave a new hand signal , which signaled the next soloist down below in forever 21 , and he danced .
and in fact , several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us .
so there &apos;s a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better .
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
our goal over the next year is to get water canary ready for the field and to open-source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation , so we can tackle this problem together .
because i want to say that much the same thing is true of religions .
and as long as you teach them that , you can teach them anything else you like .
another reviewer called it &quot; hilarious . &quot;
it wasn &apos;t the cleverness of the sheep at all .
that &apos;s the way evolution works .
suppose martian scientists came to earth .
same idea ! well , not quite .
just exactly what al is trying to do , rick is doing .
i wish he could do this with a revision , a mark 2 version of his book .
is he endorsing creationism here ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a problem .
a very clever little meme .
here are two of them .
so , we &apos;re inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us .
wwb : wind , water , birds -- stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events , all of it very healthy , all of it sound that we evolved to over the years .
secondly , get in touch with making some sound -- create sound .
and so i had to start studying , who is it that &apos;s making these decisions ?
i &apos;m a good hippie dad , so i &apos;m like , &quot; okay , you &apos;re going to learn to love the moon .
flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin .
you know the happiness project , where the experts are setting up the piano stairs , and how cool that is ?
like this dad who wrote us , his son has cerebral palsy and he can &apos;t use a normal keyboard .
we see light reflected off the moon .
now even light will be bent by those paths .
this crushed black hole actually would fit inside manhattan , more or less .
maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the sun .
and eventually , we &apos;re going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy .
these two black holes are colliding , and they will merge over a billion-year time scale .
but it &apos;s around us everywhere , presumably , if it hasn &apos;t been wiped out by some other process in the universe .
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year , i simply measured and summed each of those lines .
they &apos;ve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners .
we are there to take pride and insist on respect .
more so , i became very interested , as i was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions , i became immersed in the study of the islamic revolution -- how , indeed , it had incredibly transformed the lives of iranian women .
that all of you seem to remember iran after the islamic revolution .
they have confronted the authority .
to be compassionate is not a joke .
no religion can demolish that by indoctrination .
but the extension of the logic is that you don &apos;t need to fulfill your desire to be happy .
to discover compassion , you need to be compassionate .
with these words , thank you very much .
they were saying that they preferred the automated version of their cousin to their cousin .
we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through .
a teacher , no matter how good , has to give this one-size-fits-all lecture to 30 students -- blank faces , slightly antagonistic -- and now it &apos;s a human experience .
and the idea is you fast forward and good students start failing algebra all of a sudden and start failing calculus all of a sudden , despite being smart , despite having good teachers , and it &apos;s usually because they have these swiss cheese gaps that kept building throughout their foundation .
but what we want to do is to use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about .
they watched the video right over there .
now they can spend two hours a day and remediate , or get up to speed and not feel embarrassed about what they do or don &apos;t know .
but literally the next day they were like , &quot; can you start in two weeks ? &quot;
the idea there is , if i &apos;m confused about a topic , somehow right in the user interface i &apos;d find people who are volunteering , maybe see their reputation , and i could schedule and connect up with those people ?
so i said , &quot; what sort of things ? &quot;
she said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing , that they seemed to come on by themselves , or disappear .
i see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired .
on one occasion , he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe , and realized it was himself .
you know , i was wondering about freudian determinants .
and it &apos;s that tuesday evening back in 1982 .
and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells , which can be very , very specific .
so this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice , for patients , for doctors , for the public .
oliver sacks : what hallucination reveals about our minds
okay .
i just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing .
colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure .
we basically have a chat room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody &apos;s talking .
he &apos;s thinking about it .
scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process .
if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands , you see these things that look like teeth .
it &apos;s packaged up and bundled up .
they &apos;re called mircrotubules . that name &apos;s not important .
but most medical researchers -- discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals , which are to eradicate disease , to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty .
it was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world , and it &apos;s never going to be quenched .
the ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition .
once you have settled on a specialty , and the profession you can love , and you &apos;ve secured opportunity , your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it enough to become an expert .
you have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction , at its conclusion , of a life well lived .
and it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks ; marks on clay in that time .
twenty years ago , robert axelrod used the prisoner &apos;s dilemma as a probe of the biological question : if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors , how does cooperation exist at all ?
and again , our notions of individuals as economic beings have been overturned .
millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they &apos;re not using them to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers -- that &apos;s folding @ home at stanford -- to crack codes , to search for life in outer space .
mapping is , of course , not just about cartography , it &apos;s also about imagery .
now i just made a transition indoors . that &apos;s also interesting .
one of them is to take that real ...
at the same time , if you think about it , there &apos;s all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us .
and to start with , we created a little experiment in which we gave people legos , and we asked them to build with legos .
and if they said yes , we gave them a new one , and as they were building it , we took apart the one that they just finished .
in that condition the correlation was zero .
but if you understood how important meaning is , then you would figure out that it &apos;s actually important to spend some time , energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they &apos;re doing .
now there &apos;s good news and bad news here .
it was as if you bought it in the store .
why ? because now the builders loved it even more .
and you can ask yourself , what happens in a knowledge economy ?
and here is a picture of the khmer rouge .
so the khmer rouge took us from a place called pursat to kaoh tiev , which is across from the border from vietnam .
so i want to tell you a story -- an encouraging story -- about addressing desperation , depression and despair in afghanistan , and what we have learned from it , and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help them to regain some confidence in the time ahead -- in the future -- and how to participate again in everyday life .
no one can survive alone .
and i explained to him quickly , i would train psycho-social counselors , i would open centers , and i explained to him why .
and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients , but now this will change .
transport , we don &apos;t need oil anymore . &quot;
i should emphasize , both of these axes are logarithmic . as you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar you &apos;re going up a factor of 10 .
well , we consume 1.25 watts per square meter .
there are other options for generating power as well which don &apos;t involve fossil fuels .
it comfortably accommodates one teenager and it &apos;s shorter than a traffic cone , and it &apos;s almost as efficient as a bicycle as long as you drive it at 15 miles per hour .
so i &apos;m a strong advocate of having grown-up conversations that are based on numbers and facts , and i want to close with this map that just visualizes for you the requirement of land and so forth in order to get just 16 light bulbs per person from four of the big possible sources .
he mentioned four great world orchestras , and the fifth one was venezuela &apos;s youth symphony orchestra .
the structure of el sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region , and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class all over venezuela .
he becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level , who &apos;ll later become a full citizen .
where you are now , all of a sudden , sitting in front of personal computers and video text -- teletext systems , and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen ?
and maybe ...
filmmakers , for example , are the experts in monologue making : you make a film and it has a well-formed beginning , middle and end , and in some sense the art of it is that .
the words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words , so i can get a different definition by just touching the word , and the definition appears , superimposed over the illustration .
the principal said , &quot; there &apos;s a dreadful mistake , because that child can &apos;t read .
and in fact , it &apos;s a powerful educational instrument .
and it really is reconstructing , quite accurately , teleconferencing .
but those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet .
and that switchover , when we had the larger number of older people on the planet , for the first time than younger people .
this mentality of traveling to and timesharing large , expensive healthcare systems actually began in 1787 .
we can &apos;t afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured .
i can &apos;t stop this from happening .
i know this because look at how punctuated meal time is when they are no longer in their particular rooms here . right ?
at tedmed , eric dishman makes a bold argument : the us health care system is like computing circa 1959 , tethered to big , unwieldy central systems : hospitals , doctors , nursing homes . as our aging population booms , it &apos;s imperative , he says , to create personal , networked , home-based health care for all .
in social groups of animals , the juveniles always look different than the adults .
and so she looked into the bone of this t. rex , one of the thigh bones , and she actually found some very interesting structures in there .
she took the bone , and she dumped it into acid .
so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct .
transgenesis is really cool too .
and he &apos;s looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop , and he &apos;s interested in how birds actually lost their tail .
and people always say , &quot; why do that ?
eventually , i set about writing my book , really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale . what this shows is a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world .
the first biscuit we &apos;re going to lose before we even leave the farm .
this farmer , for example , has invested 16,000 pounds in growing spinach , not one leaf of which he harvested , because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it .
i answered that question when i was 15 .
you just press it .
it &apos;s time for bolotnitsa ! &quot;
and of course there will be advertisements .
something is askew here .
that &apos;s euler , his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool , not that funny , but it is cool .
better really hurry up .
it &apos;s a different kind of course . and they &apos;ve got five apples ?
just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted .
you can see , even if you don &apos;t go for the numbers , the beauty of the symmetry .
unbelievable . this is like crazy .
there &apos;s actually only about 20 people on each page , because we have the name , address and telephone number of every single person .
they didn &apos;t intend to screw up asia , but they did because of the way that the protocols work .
everything started breaking .
it &apos;s actually relatively simple to do , technically , because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground , existing wireless infrastructure .
as a result , the americans take the threat very seriously .
estonia accused russia .
not all of them have happy endings .
and i flew over a lagoon with a shark in it , and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born .
they kind of have a sixth sense like superman &apos;s x-ray vision .
it &apos;s not something you want to put on your facebook page , right ?
he goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish .
i had to kill my main character , who is a shark .
and you can have anything in that room , anything you want , but you can &apos;t see anything .
i won &apos;t be taking you to the high arctic , the life of the inuit , or to the searing sands of the sahara .
men , women and children of all ages , elders in wheelchairs , have blockaded the only road access to the interior .
that &apos;s right . now , since i haven &apos;t had the chance to work with these calculators , i need to make sure that they are all working properly .
23 squared , ok .
205,849 ?
9,758 , this will take me a little bit of time , so bear with me .
one digit at a time , i shall try and determine the digit you &apos;ve left out .
audience : november . november what ?
we can do it that way .
there was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator .
while i explain something else -- -- i know , that you can use , right ?
in a lively show , mathemagician arthur benjamin races a team of calculators to figure out 3-digit squares , solves another massive mental equation and guesses a few birthdays . how does he do it ? he &apos;ll tell you .
it probably has lies in it as well .
it &apos;s one sided . it &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
robert moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
and i said , &quot; well , i &apos;ve taught graduate -- i &apos;ve had graduate students , i &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot;
and there &apos;s no time to do it .
so , i &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; i got to clear out of here ! &quot;
so , at this time , i &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the hayes hall tower bells : &quot; all truth is one .
first up : crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in manhattan with partners mutopo and jovoto.com .
you can take paperwork , books , movies , and you can make it disappear -- it &apos;s magic .
writer and designer graham hill asks : can having less stuff , in less room , lead to more happiness ? he makes the case for taking up less space , and lays out three rules for editing your life .
this is in nature : it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death .
it doesn &apos;t have a particular purpose , and that &apos;s what &apos;s great about play .
preschool kids , for example , should be allowed to dive , hit , whistle , scream , be chaotic , and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive , emotional and physical -- that come as a part of rough and tumble play .
the reason i put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does .
that &apos;s a shame .
so what i would encourage on an individual level to do , is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear , joyful , playful image that you have , whether it &apos;s with a toy , on a birthday or on a vacation .
but when you take it off -- that &apos;s when the real action happens .
and you get them into a group together focused on play , and it &apos;s pretty hard not to take it seriously .
so when you &apos;re looking at this thing in the dining room , you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos , and it &apos;s not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert , and it &apos;s just kind of like a mind-ripper .
hc : so if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things , we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon , and it makes it go from sweet to savory .
and here &apos;s how news shapes what americans see .
so , if you put it all together , this could help explain why today &apos;s college graduates , as well as less educated americans , know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago .
and the thing i &apos;m really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of interactive experiences .
and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically , a relative mapping between curvature and shape .
you know ? they don &apos;t imagine the person in the booth , typing it all .
so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them .
it &apos;s always kind of doing a double take : &quot; what ? &quot;
and you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses from animals into human populations .
patrice and patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes .
it &apos;s one that i think we all need to ask ourselves , which is , why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here .
and this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message , whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention .
so , once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring , we decided to move this from research , to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort .
so i learned to follow hunches even though you can &apos;t necessarily justify them or know where they &apos;re going to go .
twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium : you send one message and it goes out to everybody , and you receive the messages you &apos;re interested in .
we &apos;re not quite done yet .
so i was an early reader , and what i read were british and american children &apos;s books .
so the year i turned eight we got a new house boy .
never mind that i knew nothing about places like namibia .
there were endless stories of mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system , sneaking across the border , being arrested at the border , that sort of thing .
but the truth is that i had a very happy childhood , full of laughter and love , in a very close-knit family .
he disagreed . he felt that people who could read , would read , if you made literature affordable and available to them .
i would like to end with this thought : that when we reject the single story , when we realize that there is never a single story about any place , we regain a kind of paradise .
it literally flat-lined .
well for the sake of time , i want to focus on just three strategies .
we need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are .
or , we decide that we &apos;re going to prevent dementia , and it will never happen to us because we &apos;re going to do everything right and it won &apos;t come and get us .
so i &apos;ve been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on .
thank you .
how do you do it from the power of the consumer up ?
as a matter of fact , we added to the contract .
20 miles per gallon that &apos;s a buck 50 , a buck 60 a gallon .
but one of them carlos ghosn , ceo of renault and nissan , when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating .
we decided to come into the u.s .
by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we &apos;re going at right now .
china is adding those cars -- india , russia , brazil .
in israel , we &apos;ve asked to put a solar farm in the south of israel .
we didn &apos;t say we &apos;re going to send a man 20 percent to the moon .
robert full and frans lanting and others -- the beauty of the things they showed .
i think they &apos;re right that evolution is fundamentally hostile to religion .
my approach to attacking creationism is to attack religion as a whole , and at this point i need to acknowledge the remarkable taboo against speaking ill of religion , and i &apos;m going to do so in the words of the late douglas adams , a dear friend who , if he never came to ted , certainly should have been invited .
whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists .
you can &apos;t help wondering why vote-seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of , for example , the jewish lobby .
i &apos;m not a citizen of this country , so i hope it won &apos;t be thought unbecoming if i suggest that something needs to be done .
darwin thought that atheism might be well and good for the intelligentsia , but that ordinary people were not , quote , &quot; ripe for it . &quot;
it lacks the strong connotation that there &apos;s definitely no god , and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth fairy agnostics .
one of the problems of writing , and working , and looking at the internet is that it &apos;s very hard to separate fashion from deep change .
this is market share of apache web server -- one of the critical applications in web-based communications .
if in 1999 i told you , let &apos;s build a data storage and retrieval system .
now , take the same problem , chunk it into little modules , and motivations become trivial .
because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes , or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model , and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see .
this is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good , and not taken out to places where they &apos;ll benefit just a few of the elite .
we have to reform our economies , change our leadership , become more democratic , be more open to change and to information .
when they kept this under wraps , but soon others got to know .
we have opportunities in housing and real estate .
and if we are down to three or four conflicts , it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable , growing , exciting economies where there &apos;s plenty of opportunity .
so if you want to be in africa , think about investing .
we can do this .
the invader draws the attention of the immune system &apos;s front-line troops .
it was easily transmitted , but , luckily , was pretty mild .
it &apos;s like , as many times as the virus changes its clothes , it &apos;s still wearing the same socks , and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks .
we really could think of flu , then , as just a bad cold .
but this assumes that our factories are humming because , in 2004 , the u.s. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant .
no longer does aids need to kill two million a year .
seth , most of us do work where every month , we produce something ; we get that kind of gratification .
there &apos;s no unemployment in squatter cities . everyone works .
and without consulting me about it , it had edited them out .
and this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see , but not necessarily what we need to see .
what we &apos;re seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones .
put yourselves in my position !
and he was waving a piece of paper , and he was yelling , &quot; call washington ! call washington ! &quot;
other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks !
the movie comes out -- the movie is a movie version of the slideshow i gave two nights ago , except it &apos;s a lot more entertaining . and it comes out in may .
this is an opportunity . not just this , but connected to the ideas that are here , to bring more coherence to them .
and they can handle water .
if you go to the place where the oil has been a while , it &apos;s an even bigger mess .
but you can see it .
the other thing about the gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the gulf at certain parts of the year .
the economic effects go at least nationally in many ways .
everybody &apos;s trying to protect the bird colonies there .
it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it &apos;s our government , meant to protect the larger public interest .
we &apos;re still lighting something on fire every time we want energy .
and i assembled this in my garage , and it now lives in the physics department of the university of nevada , reno .
but it &apos;s not just skin-deep .
in this diagram , every node is a neuron , and every line is a connection .
and we &apos;re zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times to obtain the resolution , so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time .
you guys are laughing , but you know , this book changed my life .
and yet , i persist in this quixotic endeavor .
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering .
and this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements .
if you pay 100,000 dollars , you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an arizona warehouse , awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you .
ridiculous , right ?
natural foie gras .
now , look at the guy .
i figured it out .
the landscape is incredible .
but he found this wild plant called the lupin bush .
&#91; clapping &#93; and it &apos;s getting louder and louder and they circle and circle and they land .
i was drinking this guy &apos;s kool-aid so much , he could have served me goose feathers and i would have been like , this guy &apos;s a genius , you know ?
i turned to him at the end of the meal , and it &apos;s a question i asked several times , and he hadn &apos;t , kind of , answered me directly , but i said , &quot; now look , you &apos;re in spain , some of the greatest chefs in the world are -- ferran adria , the preeminent chef of the world today , not that far from you .
by accident .
it &apos;s an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology .
at the taste3 conference , chef dan barber tells the story of a small farm in spain that has found a humane way to produce foie gras . raising his geese in a natural environment , farmer eduardo sousa embodies the kind of food production barber believes in .
open knowledge , open aid , open governance , and together , they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems i witnessed in uganda and in bihar .
tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual , and what &apos;s exciting is that with this openness , there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government .
sanjay pradhan : how open data is changing international aid
do you understand ? &quot;
they come to respect him .
it &apos;s predictable .
they said , &quot; it &apos;s good enough for government work .
and they didn &apos;t care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general , and they never expected any generals in the family , as long as you got an education and then you got a job .
and i would order the hot dog from the guy , and he &apos;d start to fix it , and then he &apos;d look around at the bodyguards and the police cars -- &quot; i &apos;ve got a green card ! i &apos;ve got a green card ! &quot;
i was trying to think , what do i talk about ? it &apos;s a good question .
and he got me a super 8 camera when i was 10 years old .
and why have i kept it ? because i &apos;m not a pack rat . i don &apos;t keep everything but for some reason i haven &apos;t opened this box .
c : i don &apos;t know . i think it just happened .
so then you go and he meets ben kenobi . ben kenobi is obi wan kenobi .
this is one of my favorite scenes ever , and this is a scene that you wouldn &apos;t necessarily think of when you think of &quot; jaws . &quot;
but i have to tell you -- this is a guy doing stuff on a quadra 950 computer -- the resolution &apos;s a little bit low -- using infinity software they stopped making 15 years ago .
and i realized that we had to do something &apos; cause it wasn &apos;t working just as it was .
companies are losing control of their customers and their employees .
companies can give people more control , but they can also give them less control .
this is revolution 2.0 .
and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years , and here comes the internet , technology , blackberry , sms .
because of the internet , the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth .
they were actually abusing them , despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were -- they were not even protesting .
i never had in my mind to see this egyptian , the amazing egyptian .
i feel that i have dignity that i have lost for so many years . &quot;
we think , by studying how the sounds are learned , we &apos;ll have a model for the rest of language , and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social , emotional and cognitive development .
english has a lot of rs and ls .
but look at what happened to the babies exposed to mandarin for 12 sessions .
we &apos;re seeing the baby brain .
i took a speaker , i placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker , and then i added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker .
now this looks already quite interesting , but let me now add some watercolors to it .
and now , let &apos;s set that on fire .
and i would suggest , it is not only humanity that won &apos;t survive , but it is all species on the planet , as we &apos;ve heard today .
it was the young women , the health aids , who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds .
it is there within every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we vote on compassion ?
the wound is just filled with maggots .
let me show you one of my favorites .
we &apos;ll start with a one-by-one square and next to that put another one-by-one square .
and then there was me , the iranian-american of the group .
i said , &quot; he passed away a long time ago .
all it takes in one person to mess it up .
and you learn great things about these places .
i went down . i go , &quot; where &apos;s my son ? &quot;
maz jobrani : did you hear the one about the iranian-american ?
it &apos;s just what i &apos;ve always wanted .
bad experiences are quickly forgotten .
now he , the guy , takes all of this in , figuring , &quot; honestly , geez , what are my chances ? &quot;
i got a pencil you can borrow .
at the time of the phone call i just had a baby , i successfully completed a management buyout to the company i was working with , and the last thing i wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high-security prisons .
he was a really keen sailor . and he had this beautiful boat .
a mix of legal and illegal activities is used .
it has happened with industrial revolution .
part of the war on terror was the introduction of the patriot act .
this is the only way for you to step into the dark side , and have a look at it .
i did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do .
so i found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the boat hook to the oars to reinforce it .
i suppose what you mean is : what happens to the boat while i &apos;m sleeping ?
the first attempt didn &apos;t go so well .
but , as i was approaching the end of my water reserves , luckily , our courses were converging .
if the atlantic was about my inner journey , discovering my own capabilities , maybe the pacific has been about my outer journey , figuring out how i can use my interesting career choice to be of service to the world , and to take some of those things that i &apos;ve learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in .
the other point : it &apos;s about taking responsibility .
i get sick . you get sick .
so this is my grandfather . i actually never met him , but he &apos;s holding my mom , and his genes are in me , right ?
it &apos;s outrage that we have this information and we can &apos;t use it .
this is like the photograph of my granddad holding my mom from a data perspective , and i had to go into the system and get it out .
closed systems , corporations , make a lot of money on the open web , and they &apos;re one of the reasons why the open web lives is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness of the system .
it &apos;s a beautiful song written by a guy called martin evan , actually , for me .
when i was nine , i saw the movie &quot; jaws , &quot; and thought to myself , &quot; no , thank you . &quot;
my saying was going to be , &quot; i &apos;m taking out the trash ! &quot;
from there , i was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home .
he tried to kill himself in grade 10 when a kid who could still go home to mom and dad had the audacity to tell him , &quot; get over it . &quot;
of course they did .
so once this thing really gets going , and it really starts to mangle the audio i &apos;m putting into it , it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice , but it is , so i &apos;m going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple .
that is literally all my voice being manipulated , and when you get to that point , you have to ask , don &apos;t you , what &apos;s the point ?
now you &apos;ve probably heard about the porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground in arctic national wildlife refuge .
no tar sands mine has actually ever been denied approval , so it is essentially a rubber stamp .
in fort chippewa , the 800 people there , are finding toxins in the food chain , this has been scientifically proven .
and also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison , and also , of course , critical habitat for another whole range of other species .
everyone in this room , everyone across canada , everyone listening to this presentation has a role to play and , i think , a responsibility .
brooklyn-based chitra ganesh is known for her digital collages , using indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material .
here , they invite the viewer to analyze a crime looking at evidence and clues embedded in five narratives on these five different screens , in which the city itself may have been the culprit .
now , something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design , too . this was done by saatchi and saatchi , and they actually got away with this ad in australia . so , if you look at this ad for beer , all those people are in sort of provocative positions . but they got it passed , and actually won the clio awards , so it &apos;s funny how you can do these things .
now , i &apos;m going to skip ahead since i &apos;m sort of running &#91; behind &#93; . i want to show you quickly what i &apos;ve created , some new type of illusions . i &apos;ve done something with taking the pixar-type illusions . so you see these kids the same size here , running down the hall . the two table tops of the same size .
so the more you step back , embrace complexity , the better chance you have of finding simple answers , and it &apos;s often different than the simple answer that you started with .
i &apos;m a gamer , so i like to have goals .
and that &apos;s what i want to share with you today -- the top five regrets of the dying .
are games doing this yet ? i &apos;m not sure , so i &apos;ve left a question mark , a super mario question mark .
now this was anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process , things like bright lights and crowded spaces .
we usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder .
pick one : stand up and take three steps , or make your hands into fists , raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds . go !
got that ?
you can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes .
my sister and i started this project in 2005 because in that year , at least in the science press , there was a lot of talk about global warming , and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs .
and to cut a long story short , eight months later we did fill the chicago cultural center &apos;s 3,000 square foot gallery .
but you get too many stitches on the needle . so she quickly realized crochet was the better thing .
now mathematicians have answered that question .
then our mathematicians come along and said , &quot; there &apos;s this thing called a sphere , and the lines come together at the north and south pole . &quot;
and so in some sense they literally , they had such a symbolic view of mathematics , they couldn &apos;t actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them .
they write these great symbolic treatises called books , and papers , and op-ed articles .
but there &apos;s another rare syndrome , so rare , in fact , that very few physicians have heard about it , not even neurologists .
i talked about that earlier .
you take the patient and show him pictures on the screen and measure his galvanic skin response .
he knows that the arm is not there , but , nevertheless , it &apos;s a compelling sensory experience for the patient .
he had a phantom arm , excruciatingly painful , and he couldn &apos;t move it .
he said , &quot; it &apos;s gone . &quot;
or c sharp -- sometimes , tones evoke color .
in all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
now , this is very important , because what it &apos;s telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- it &apos;s just -- it looks like a silly illusion , but these photons in your eye are doing this shape , and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern , but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .
there are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired and that there &apos;s something very , very special about man .
so the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier .
i hope i have a lighter .
here panbanisha uses scissors , instead of her hands , to groom nyota .
she takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor .
once you have that capacity , the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely .
we &apos;re learning how to become like them .
each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it .
and , as we &apos;ve learned in the last few years , galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter : particles in huge swarms , far smaller even than atomic nuclei .
the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms , within a factor of two of the mass of each person here .
first , any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones .
if you represent the earth &apos;s lifetime by a single year , say from january when it was made to december , the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in june -- a tiny fraction of the year .
but could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the earth &apos;s life ?
so they have more debt and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery .
huge effect here of starbucks .
maybe you have something in mind , maybe not .
and we can see what the relationship is between those two things .
but when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates , they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money .
and more about &quot; if i &apos;ve got five dollars or 15 dollars , what can i do to benefit other people ? &quot;
the iranians built a special tarmac at the airport in tehran , far away from the central terminal , so that no one would notice the large number of israeli planes shuttling between tel aviv and tehran .
tehran was not interested .
last year here at ted i asked you to give me your data , to put your data on the web , on the basis that if people put data onto the web -- government data , scientific data , community data , whatever it is -- it will be used by other people to do wonderful things , in ways that they never could have imagined .
in fact , this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data.gov , and data.gov.uk .
we &apos;re focusing now on port-au-prince .
what we can say , number one , as the supreme court said in citizens united , that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials , because , after all , there is a general election , but only after the lesters have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in the general election .
as anyone would , as they do this , they develop a sixth sense , a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money .
now this is a dependence too , but it &apos;s different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people .
you focus on the possible problems , like eradicating polio from the world , or taking an image of every single street across the globe , or building the first real universal translator , or building a fusion factory in your garage .
so it &apos;s fair to ask , how is it possible for them to change this ?
nothing you can do . &quot;
on october 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
&quot; sputnik &quot; will soon be released .
the second half was just one big nap , pretty much , in class .
how much depends on how lucky you are .
it extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos .
now , all this changes when a predator enters the scene .
a computer is , in a way , just another experiment .
well , you don &apos;t have to be a whole creature .
i &apos;ve set it on the fastest setting , and i &apos;m going to now take another one set to the same setting .
he said , &quot; that &apos;s the vision i want to give to london .
boy : we had to do this because , to keep in balance because if you didn &apos;t keep your balance , then you would just fall over about , like , to the left or right , about 45 degrees .
the most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people -- apparently rocking from side to side in unison , not only with each other , but with the bridge .
it &apos;s really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it .
so , let me show you a picture of one form of diversity .
it &apos;s called &quot; the apples of new york &quot; and this is the second volume .
now , the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world , and the place where climate change , ironically , is going to be the worst is in south asia and sub-saharan africa .
you don &apos;t look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear , but it &apos;s very important diversity .
there &apos;s 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now .
we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future .
this is a very serious newspaper ; it &apos;s times of england -- very serious . this is a very -- -- gentlemen and ladies , be serious .
and this is how they are promoting the product . this is -- i didn &apos;t touch it , this is original .
i &apos;m really troubled by that . but anyway that &apos;s -- the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today , though , is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later .
i didn &apos;t do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing and , well , we didn &apos;t have drugs in those days . but i did competition model airplanes .
there were only three or four flights in 2003 .
but what happened , the fact that we had this big industry , big development , big improvement and capability and so on , and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention .
sputnik wasn &apos;t a technical loss , but it was a prestige loss .
but nasa is developing the space liner , always has , and runs the only space line , ok . and we &apos;ve shied away from it because we &apos;re afraid of it . but starting back in june of 2004 , when i showed that a little group out there actually can do it , can get a start with it , everything changed after that time .
i &apos;m a digital immigrant .
so he does a &quot; radical &quot; thing .
you see , people at their fingertips now , everybody , not just julian assange , have these powerful tools for finding out what &apos;s going on , scrutinizing , informing others , and even organizing collective responses .
first of all , there aren &apos;t a lot of big inventions in the pipeline , and this is a big problem for human health , and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem , that they &apos;re about to fall off something called the patent cliff .
up until two years ago , all revolutions in human history had a leadership , and when the old regime fell , the leadership and the organization would take power .
the internet enables each of us to be a producer .
could we start to share our intelligence ?
and when those excess vessels are no longer needed , the body prunes them back to baseline using naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis .
and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly .
we had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week .
but i actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking : what could we be adding to our diet that &apos;s naturally antiangiogenic , that could boost the body &apos;s defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers ?
statins , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a few others , they inhibit angiogenesis too .
stop the treatment , gains the weight back .
okay . well , thank you so much .
now , that was my first puzzle . i got hooked .
the progression of my career that you &apos;ll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact .
it &apos;s the same this way .
you can really get inside somebody &apos;s perception and have them experience something .
it &apos;s the same basic game except i introduced a new piece , a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically .
and depending on which one weighs which amount , they &apos;ll fall different directions .
and then there is social media , and what &apos;s happening on the internet .
and we have people all over the world doing that now .
i actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we &apos;ve had to train everyone not to be that .
i remember , for example , when my father , who was very , very violent , used to beat me .
we sell them , we kill them as embryos , we enslave them , we rape them .
and i want to talk about a girl that i just met recently in bukavu , who was impregnated by her rapist .
she &apos;s changed the rules .
and what she said to him was , &quot; you were willing to sell me for four cows , and a calf and some blankets .
i can tell you he won &apos;t call back . it &apos;s a vibe i share .
you don &apos;t tell the atlantic ocean to behave .
and so he came up with this beautiful curve .
and of course i had to go to africa and ask folks why .
so , when i got to the village , i said , &quot; can you take me to the square building ?
and three times , the answer is no .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
they said , &quot; it &apos;s not a matter of money . this is a religious matter . &quot;
george boole took leibniz &apos;s binary code and created boolean algebra , and john von neumann took boolean algebra and created the digital computer .
and if you don &apos;t think that capitalism , which is self-organizing , can have destructive effects , you haven &apos;t opened your eyes enough .
are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress , draw our family closer , and generally prepare our children to enter the world ?
eighty-three percent of projects failed .
&quot; i told david , &apos; keep your work out of my kitchen . &apos; but i was wrong . &quot;
three years later -- our girls are almost eight now -- we &apos;re still holding these meetings .
it turns out there &apos;s only 10 minutes of productive time in any family meal .
she said , &quot; do i get one five-minute overreaction or can i get 10 30-second overreactions ? &quot;
i made popcorn . actually , i burned one , so i made two .
spend time retelling the story of your family &apos;s positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones .
bruce feiler has a radical idea : to deal with the stress of modern family life , go agile . inspired by agile software programming , feiler introduces family practices which encourage flexibility , bottom-up idea flow , constant feedback and accountability . one surprising feature : kids pick their own punishments .
you can see the difference .
it &apos;s happening !
it makes &quot; the davinci code &quot; seem like &quot; war and peace . &quot;
probably a form of synesthesia .
mt : well , maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told them it could be used to contact other planets .
they didn &apos;t know exactly what they were doing .
i tell my friends that no neuron is safe from a neurosurgeon , because we can really reach just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now .
we did not know what to do with this boy .
can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter ?
we can now reach those circuits .
really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer .
it &apos;s a beautiful model . let &apos;s look at the mathematics .
it goes up to four meters per second when it runs .
we have one here and notice its position . it &apos;s holding on .
first we &apos;ll see the animals toes peeling -- look at that .
they don &apos;t have any glue , and they even stick under water just fine .
and the story of the intermittent absorption refrigerator .
we think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
and so i said , &quot; did you just move into this office ? &quot;
two , make your partner a real partner .
the problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows : women systematically underestimate their own abilities .
but that one word made a really big difference .
i &apos;ve become convinced that we &apos;ve made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home .
and i said , &quot; so are you and your husband thinking about having a baby ? &quot;
thank you .
people brush and floss their teeth .
so fear showed up as not really the driver .
it &apos;s not just hitting us in our heads ; it &apos;s hitting us in our hearts .
because in health care , most health care , the data is very removed from the action .
every time you take a drug , you &apos;re walking into a possible side effect .
but again , always using color and personalized proximity to that information .
so this patient is in their 50s , so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is .
ordinary people are capable of understanding this information , if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form that they can engage with .
i had decided what kind of potato i wanted to plant -- i had picked my yukon gold or yellow finn , or whatever it was -- and i had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country , brought it , and i was planting it .
that a certain kind of potato , a certain kind of drug , a sativa-indica cannabis cross has something to say about us .
their complexity , their sophistication , is something to really marvel at , and i think it &apos;s really the scandal of the human genome project .
and i &apos;ll show you , if you take this approach , what you get , ok ?
what happens to the grass when you do this ?
and he kind of nodded , you know ?
it was incredible . you could listen to sound on the computer .
it &apos;s just amazing , fear . but that &apos;s form , content .
this is , like , a ring of letters .
and as a new media artist , he reflected , and said , you know , i &apos;ve spent my whole career making new media art .
someone who &apos;s creative actually loves to learn from mistakes .
so these kind of systems , i believe , are important .
and the tools , the resources that we use to build a game layer are game dynamics themselves .
it &apos;s going to affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly .
you won &apos;t do anything else with the rest of your day .
so they whip it out . and you see men , they have that black card .
i mean , you see this is a paladin level 10 , and that &apos;s a paladin level 20 , and if you were going to fight , you know , orcs on the fields of mordor against the raz al ghul , you &apos;d probably want to be the bigger one , right .
and they actually had to end up shutting down the leader board because while it was effective , it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories and started having people work to maintain their leadership .
audience : yes .
and pretty much everywhere there is power , there is the internet .
as a part of -- you know , part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches .
this is our vp of engineering .
and we wouldn &apos;t really be sure if it &apos;s going to work or not .
and it &apos;s sort of like a better version of the toolbar .
you want it to be consistent .
maybe , sergey , you can highlight this .
i &apos;d like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking .
but he didn &apos;t stop there . he didn &apos;t stop with just trying to design the best railway journey .
it &apos;s often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas .
instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption , design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation -- the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful , productive and profitable .
so why design thinking ?
what kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle ?
well , since i couldn &apos;t have my tea the way i wanted it , i ordered a cup of coffee , which the waiter brought over promptly .
the first group came in , and they were greeted by miss smith , who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles .
it requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act .
when asked , &quot; what words and images do you associate with choice ? &quot;
yet still , many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them .
american parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; what if ? what if ? &quot;
when it comes to choice , we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narratives .
&quot; what does it look like ? &quot;
well , that &apos;s exactly what i want to talk about today , is how we can use these natural forces to remediate these man-made problems .
and so that &apos;s the beginning of protei , and that &apos;s the first boat in history that completely changed the shape of the hull in order to control it , are very superior compared to a normal boat .
other property is this : a normal sailing boat has a centerboard here and a rudder at the back , and these two things are what creates most resistance and turbulence behind the boat , but because this doesn &apos;t have either a centerboard or a rudder , we hope that if we keep working on this hull design we can improve and have less resistance .
so protei is now an international network of innovation for selling technology using this shape-shifting hull .
of course i always wondered what would happen if he &apos;d kissed the airplane first .
well the act of drawing airplanes led me to , when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school , led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering .
but not office chairs .
one is : you can &apos;t accommodate everybody .
and they go up easily .
now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it &apos;ll fit , you know , a tall guy and a short girl .
so 50 years ago , pretty much no one had heard of it , no one certainly in the european environment .
they will lay their eggs in clear water , any pool , any puddle , any birdbath , any flower pot , anywhere there &apos;s clear water , they &apos;ll lay their eggs , and if that clear water is near freight , it &apos;s near a port , if it &apos;s anywhere near transport , those eggs will then get transported around the world .
it has to be safe .
so the males will go out , they &apos;ll look for females , they &apos;ll mate . if they mate successfully , then no offspring .
i &apos;m in favor of particularly where the older technologies don &apos;t work well or have become unacceptable .
but this part of the equation i didn &apos;t really get , and i don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
and on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
there are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
it &apos;s called geomedicine . there are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
hang left at cranky , right at preoccupied , u-turn on silent treatment , all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin &apos; .
i &apos;d be like some kind of internet genius , and me , i &apos;d like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop ! -- i &apos;d go wireless .
the green areas are the areas we use to grow crops , like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever .
imagine that was lake superior .
it &apos;s more than all our electricity .
you see a lot of this in africa , even latin america , but interestingly , eastern europe , where soviet union and eastern bloc countries used to be , is still a mess agriculturally .
global pastures cover 30 million km ² .
we need collaboration , imagination , determination , because failure is not an option .
i don &apos;t conceive of it that way .
it &apos;s a business plan for a corporation .
so it &apos;s very important to them to track piracy exactly because of this , and the people who are buying , the pirates , are not their customers anyway , because their customers want the real deal .
so , all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions .
so , one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria , and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water , tend to be more harmful .
if it didn &apos;t produce a lot of this toxin , then you might find a smaller number .
each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person -- a lot of variation on which natural selection can act .
so , we can go to the same countries and look and see .
and that experiment was done in northern alabama .
in a way , much more powerful than the kind of tools we &apos;re looking at , because most of what &apos;s being done today is to rely on things like anti-malarial drugs .
paul ewald : can we domesticate germs ?
they work by harnessing shoulder power .
but at the end of the day , how do we tell these robotic arms what to do ?
so this is the first man that we tried it on .
on the left-hand side , you see his original prosthesis , and he &apos;s using those switches to move little blocks from one box to the other .
amanda kitts : sure . in 2006 , i had a car accident .
and it provides intuitive control .
she &apos;s carrying all the weight through harnesses .
but my favorite one was just when the hand was open , because i work with kids , and so all the time you &apos;re clapping and singing , so i was able to do that again , which was really good .
once we can do it that small , it &apos;s a lot easier making them bigger .
yet what puzzled me most was celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial , yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed .
the second point i would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial .
yes , there is a need for us to find a cure for hiv , to find an effective vaccine for malaria , to find a diagnostic tool that works for t.b. , but i believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way .
i mean , they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it .
and this is true of most of our living systems .
so the oceans don &apos;t always act together ; they act differently , but that is the kind of variation that penguins have to live with , and it &apos;s not easy .
at first , the argentine government said , &quot; no , there &apos;s no way .
this past year , in 2009 , you can see that they &apos;re now raising about a fourth of a chick , and some of these individuals are going more than 900 kilometers away from their nests .
and now he &apos;s looking at the other guy , saying , &quot; you are really weird . &quot;
think of penguins as ocean sentinels , says dee boersma -- they &apos;re on the frontlines of sea change . sharing stories of penguin life and culture , she suggests that we start listening to what penguins are telling us .
and i &apos;ll give you an example : the now magazine from last week -- progressive , downtown weekly in toronto .
but most importantly , it &apos;s voluntary .
we can reform our electoral systems .
and we can try to anticipate those changes , and shape them in a more constructive direction .
but nothing has more perversely impacted russia &apos;s demographic distribution , because the people in the east , who never wanted to be there anyway , have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west .
again , globalization chinese style .
some of these organizations don &apos;t even have the united states as a member .
and today , if you go to kurdistan , you &apos;ll see that kurdish peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the sunni iraqi army .
now what might this entire region look like if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders , when the insecurities might abate ?
but now it &apos;s contributing gas across the caspian sea to provide for europe , and even a potentially turkmen- afghan-pakistan-india pipeline as well .
in bosnia you use the euro currency already , and that &apos;s the only currency they &apos;re probably ever going to have .
there is a great race on for energy resources under the arctic seabed .
now these animals are different from one another , because they have different genes .
the animal &apos;s clearly in the nursing home .
okay , so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell ?
so maybe it &apos;s working in people the same way .
and many of these different genes , we &apos;ve shown , actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant .
and not only that , it can also just last longer , even if there isn &apos;t a hurricane .
so this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer .
and the 70 year-old ones , actually they &apos;re better at scouting out the good nesting places , and they also have more progeny every year .
as we heard from dr. insel this morning , psychiatric disorders like autism , depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering .
so if we inhibit a particular type of neuron , and we find that a behavior is blocked , we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior .
so we quantified this behavior using custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator pietro perona , who &apos;s in the electrical engineering division here at caltech .
so that means that these flies have two abnormalities , or phenotypes , as we geneticists call them , that one finds in adhd : hyperactivity and learning disability .
don &apos;t you ?
on the left here you see the bites by the dutch malarial mosquito on this person .
here we have a bar with four holes , and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole .
there we go . okay .
as the demand for donor organs continues to rise , in large part due to the aging population , the supply has remained relatively constant .
now just about that time , the practice of surgery evolved from big to small , from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures , tiny incisions .
if this research is successful , it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .
there are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease .
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela .
what are they doing right ?
in other words , men , you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department .
i can &apos;t tell you anymore about that one because i stopped reading it at the headline .
and also , my husband does a lot around the house , and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives .
your brains are about 100 million times more complicated .
so around the turn of the last century , i started to think , &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be wonderful if one could take this logic and turn it upside down ? &quot;
it was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student , susana lima .
the left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors , and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them .
its behavior is completely unchanged .
i don &apos;t know about you , but i find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical , mechanistic understanding of the mind , even if it &apos;s the mind of the fly .
and it &apos;s dependent on passive patients who just take it and don &apos;t ask any questions .
and i know you want to look and see if those spots are still there .
and these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients , especially in an era of superbugs and hospital-acquired infections .
and this happens to millions of people every year .
and i think that &apos;s why i achieved longevity .
let me share with you today an original discovery .
with a mattress below and attached to a safety rope , lynn began her 60-foot ascent .
we said , &quot; well , what do tails do ? &quot;
it has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg , and it contributes to stability .
okay , there it goes .
definitely moving towards the landing target .
biologist robert full studies the amazing gecko , with its supersticky feet and tenacious climbing skill . but high-speed footage reveals that the gecko &apos;s tail harbors perhaps the most surprising talents of all .
we &apos;ve also talked about concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
we inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere , and we have trace gases , and not just carbon dioxide -- it &apos;s methane , ozone , oxides of sulfur and nitrogen .
this is a crazy thing , this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket to keep everybody warm , drilling at temperatures of minus 40 .
this is absolutely beautiful stuff .
and it &apos;s covered with algae . that &apos;s what happens .
you can see some of the coral cores there on the right .
there &apos;s a whole family of curves here .
you know , we &apos;re pumping out lots of co2 into the atmosphere , from fossil fuels , from cement production .
now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean , with co2 levels lower than they are today .
this is donna .
i got drawn into this community and i began to take pictures there .
i had somebody bring it there because i wanted to get access to al jazeera , george bush &apos;s favorite channel and a place which i was very curious about because it &apos;s disliked by many governments across the arab world and also called the mouthpiece of osama bin laden by some people in the u.s. government .
that &apos;s bad . &quot;
how do we understand what the other person is thinking ? &quot;
and that you give israel an alibi to carry on ?
we see that there are palestinians who suffered a lot , who lost children , and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation .
i watched it and i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m blown away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world , independent voices from around the world , and create a truly democratic , global television .
so what we &apos;d like to call this day of film is pangea cinema day .
all of that could be described using newton &apos;s work .
so kaluza said to himself , einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space -- in fact , space and time , to be more precise .
so , imagine you &apos;re looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light .
the idea is like this .
when you study the mathematics of string theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space .
they have a very rich , intertwined geometry .
and if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate , this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there .
and how many people think it &apos;s the orange one ?
you vary any one of those parameters , and you &apos;ll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye .
beau lotto : &quot; what are you reading ? &quot; half the letters are missing . right ?
so , what does this mean for context ?
the four blue tiles on the left are gray .
and they go back and forth between this hive and the arena , via this tube .
we can &apos;t . instead , the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past .
we &apos;re defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment -- by our ecology .
and they &apos;re different .
we make these trade-offs again and again , multiple times a day .
one example would be , people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common .
one in a million , one in a billion -- they &apos;re both almost never .
if you don &apos;t understand the risks , you don &apos;t understand the costs , you &apos;re likely to get the trade-off wrong , and your feeling doesn &apos;t match reality .
it &apos;s limited by our cognitive biases .
so an example might be , if you go back 100 years ago when electricity was first becoming common , there were a lot of fears about it .
i &apos;m going to give one more complication .
new models that extend long periods of time are hard .
and that &apos;s okay .
and this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether you live in a small african village , or you live in a big city , everything comes back to plants in the end : whether it &apos;s for the food , the medicine , the fuel , the construction , the clothing , all the obvious things ; or whether it &apos;s for the spiritual and recreational things that matter to us so much ; or whether it &apos;s soil formation , or the effect on the atmosphere , or primary production .
and we decided that what we want to store first of all , are the species that are most under threat .
and then we grow these things , and we tell people , back in the countries where these seeds have come from , &quot; look , actually we &apos;re not just storing this to get the seeds later , but we can give you this information about how to germinate these difficult plants . &quot;
i &apos;m here because i have a very important message : i think we have found the most important factor for success .
a great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow , they were in trouble .
i end with -- the koreans did this .
and the goal at first was just saving it from demolition , but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it .
last year we had about two million people , which is about 10 times what we ever estimated .
new york was planning to tear down the high line , an abandoned elevated railroad in manhattan , when robert hammond and a few friends suggested : why not make it a park ? he shares how it happened in this tale of local cultural activism .
it was black or white .
but then they need a different political process than the one they were given in 2001 , 2002 .
the point is that we are probably seeing , for the first time in the history of the arab world , a revolution bottom-up -- people &apos;s revolution .
the paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this .
and i believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy , not only between states , but also within states .
our modern western societies are more complex than before , in this time of migration .
it &apos;s the kind of thing that i sit up late at night thinking about sometimes -- often at four in the morning .
so , this used to be completely smooth .
a metamaterial is an artificial material , which manipulates , in this case , electromagnetic radiation , in a way that you couldn &apos;t otherwise .
it turns out , a , it &apos;s useful , and for a geek like me , it &apos;s fun .
now , to find dinosaurs , you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur .
this is actually what most dinosaur research looks like .
and you know , when i was at microsoft , that was so engrossing , and the whole industry was expanding so much , that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life .
but it &apos;s limited , because really to know if it &apos;s a healthy restaurant , you need to taste the food , you need to know what goes on in the kitchen , you need the product of all of those ingredients .
now of course , in medical application , that is very useful because it &apos;s the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history -- except probably , your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do .
not going to be easy . &quot;
but we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it .
and many people in this audience probably wouldn &apos;t be alive if doctors didn &apos;t do this .
so what we need is to have a causative model of what &apos;s actually going on , and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that .
danny hills makes a case for the next frontier of cancer research : proteomics , the study of proteins in the body . as hillis explains it , genomics shows us a list of the ingredients of the body -- while proteomics shows us what those ingredients produce . understanding what &apos;s going on in your body at the protein level may lead to a new understanding of how cancer happens .
all of you are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to simply write people off .
because it is in stage three that many of us move .
and my question on the other side is just going to be , &quot; what do you think they value ? &quot;
and people came together focused only on those two values : truth and reconciliation .
in fact , martin luther king &apos;s most famous line was at stage three .
i mean , if i was into boxing , like they were , then my life wouldn &apos;t suck . but i don &apos;t . so it does .
they had people involved who were nobel laureates in economics , who reported being bored .
we know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room .
that so many of the city &apos;s most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom , is cause for celebration .
as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance .
that &apos;s the end . thank you .
what &apos;s in its universe of attendant virtues ?
matthew &apos;s legs don &apos;t work , and he &apos;ll never walk again , and -- and he does experience this as an &quot; and &quot; rather than a &quot; but &quot; -- and he experiences himself to be healed and whole .
and that the highest human calling is to look for this light , to point at it when we see it , to gather it up , and in so doing , to repair the world .
and by the look of that paunch , he hasn &apos;t been doing enough yoga .
when i was nine years old i went off to summer camp for the first time .
i could have told you 50 others just like it -- all the times that i got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go , that i should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert .
we sat in rows of desks like this , and we did most of our work pretty autonomously .
and what i &apos;m saying is that culturally we need a much better balance .
and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time ?
here &apos;s a novel by milan kundera .
but i &apos;ll tell you , what helps even more is my sense , my belief , my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude , we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change .
but occasionally , just occasionally , i hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see , because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &quot; but why can &apos;t i figure out my problems ? &quot;
i started it with one other family in 1980 .
do you think we have a stewardship here , to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
we just said , we &apos;re not going to use it on us .
but that &apos;s not the good life .
he says , &quot; i want you to make me famous .
but moses , if you saw the movie , &quot; the ten commandments , &quot; moses goes out , and there &apos;s this burning bush , and god talks to him .
first , it represented his identity .
and even though you &apos;re only going to be in the nba for a few years , you &apos;re going to be an nba player for the rest of your life .
some people have the misguided idea that god only gets excited when you &apos;re doing , quote , &quot; spiritual things , &quot; like going to church or helping the poor , or , you know , confessing or doing something like that .
it &apos;s the minister of defense with whom we &apos;re working , not the minister of education , because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off , in which the people who had been causing , if you will , 40 years &apos; worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived .
in a village , you have 100 laptops , each with a different set of 100 books , and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for picnic area .
you guys are answering the question : how does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
so by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits -- and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
so this is a huge practical problem .
augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
and something else happened instead .
bioenergy isn &apos;t global warming . bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive . bioenergy is oil . it &apos;s gas . it &apos;s coal . and part of building that bridge to the future , to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way , or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff , is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it . and to do that , you really have to look first at agriculture .
so you take something like this , you burn it , you put it under pressure , and likely as not , you get this . although , again , i stress : we don &apos;t know .
this is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low . people come up with really smart ideas for solar panels , or for wind , or for something else , and then guess what ?
and what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home .
and that &apos;s what i did a few years ago when i took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what i call the transformation pyramid , which is survival , success and transformation .
it &apos;s actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world .
it &apos;s a good question . how do you feel about how you spend your time each day ?
just three days ago , three days ago here at ted , we had a simulcast of david cameron , potentially the next prime minister of the uk , quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time , robert kennedy &apos;s poetic speech from 1968 when he suggested that we &apos;re myopically focused on the wrong thing and that gdp is a misplaced metric .
we &apos;ve been fooled by our tool .
what can you start counting today ?
now , i want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
the first step was to ask a question .
so i &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . so here are some of the students of where the bees fly .
in other words , it starts off &quot; once upon a time , &quot; the figures are in crayon , etc .
for me , not for him . right ? because we &apos;ve only done this once before .
we &apos;ve been talking a lot about the horrific impacts of plastic on the planet and on other species , but plastic hurts people too , especially poor people .
well , the problem with being poor is you don &apos;t have those choices .
that bottle winds up getting burned .
we don &apos;t have a throwaway planet , and we don &apos;t have throwaway children -- it &apos;s all precious .
and the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts the species we &apos;ve talked about , but it even corrupts our own society .
and really , they fundamentally told you , &quot; are you going to hug a tree , or are you going to hug a child ? pick .
think about it . whether that &apos;s you in that picture or something under your desk .
it &apos;s a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a macarthur fellowship award , which is nicknamed the genius award , last september , for his discovery .
these electric cars are beautiful .
how many people want to hang them on the wall ?
you &apos;ll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back , to do that , and it probably beeps , actually , as it goes on as well .
and third , our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins .
i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food .
i believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility .
he was a chinese scholar who later , in his 60s , got a ph.d. in chinese history .
they &apos;re exotic . they &apos;re experimental .
we always had hope .
now , i think this maybe isn &apos;t a very useful way of thinking .
hospice was for people who were dying , and terence wasn &apos;t dying .
it &apos;s part of our dna as humans , and maybe it &apos;s time our healthcare system -- doctors , patients , insurance companies , us , started accounting for the power of that hope .
well , we collect data from satellites , from airplanes , from ground vehicles , from people .
extract geometry from the images .
stephen lawler : tour microsoft &apos;s virtual earth
well , i set up laboratories in santa cruz at the california fish and game facility , and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks to test some of these ideas .
and what about operating costs ?
i think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish if we are radically open and we don &apos;t care who gets the credit .
look at the skyline of shanghai .
country 1 has more telephones , and country 1 has a longer system of railways .
the economy grows , government accumulates more resources , and the government can invest in infrastructure -- rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth .
and they all tell you , &quot; yes , we have won the lottery . &quot;
i haven &apos;t told you about the definition of literacy .
financial times printed this picture of an indian textile factory with the title , &quot; india poised to overtake china in textile . &quot;
in fact , when india was growing at a hindu rate of growth -- about one percent , two percent a year -- that was when india was least democratic .
thank you very much .
what &apos;s the kind of environmental -- what is the space of creativity ?
and what they noticed was they don &apos;t have a lot of dvrs , they don &apos;t have a lot of microwaves , but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road .
and one of the problems with this is that people are actually -- when you research this field -- people are notoriously unreliable , when they actually kind of self-report on where they have their own good ideas , or their history of their best ideas .
and darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had , every little hunch .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; no , i hadn &apos;t thought of doing that .
so they went back , and they thought about it .
so there you go . that &apos;s the truth .
you can see his bones through the skin .
the reason why this is all happening is due to this , and i do have to take you through what this is about .
we were able to make that happen for them .
i want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all , i hate euthanasia . i think it &apos;s a sideshow .
they got on a boat , and yet another divergence -- the boat was either going to canada or to australia .
and so that &apos;s the project that i pursued for that year , and it &apos;s continuing now as well , and found that a specific purine derivative called &quot; guanidine &quot; had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent .
so , this really changed my view of looking at cancer .
tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels .
if every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way , cancer occurred -- i mean , everybody would have cancer almost .
i saw photographs of her , and i thought i wanted to go .
this is the morning assembly outside her school .
if you know of photographers , the joke is it &apos;s the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented .
so i finally found myung sung , her best friend that she used to play with after school every day .
i said , &quot; but you know , i bought an airline ticket , and i &apos;m stuck here for a week . &quot;
and they actually take items of clothing and photographs , and they burn them as part of the ritual .
and then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day . &quot;
so , his son said , &quot; dad , i have a sleeping bag , i &apos;ll sleep on the floor . &quot;
please , i just want to wake up , it &apos;s got to be a nightmare . &quot;
natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers , and the day we showed up turned out to be a 60-year-old man &apos;s birthday .
this is kylie , her sister , who &apos;s now a doctor , on the right .
kodak hired natasha to be a translator for them at the olympics in korea .
the first one was actually a funeral -- to be more precise , a reburial .
the telescope is actually built similarly to the , well-known to you , hubble space telescope , except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens , as you would call it as a photographer .
the small planets dominated , and there was a certain harmony to that , which actually copernicus was very happy to note , and kepler was one of the big proponents of .
our own milky way galaxy is rich in this kind of planets .
we don &apos;t need to go to space to answer that question .
now it &apos;s about something else , but it &apos;s equally profound .
it will be the size of a single , small atom .
astronomer dimitar sasselov and his colleagues search for earth-like planets that may , someday , help us answer centuries-old questions about the origin and existence of biological life elsewhere . preliminary results show that they have found 706 &quot; candidates &quot; -- some of which further research may prove to be planets with earth-like geochemical characteristics .
in the last two to three years , we have reached a steady state of hiv epidemic in the world .
and you &apos;ll find madagascar , and you &apos;ll find a lot of african countries about as low as the rest of the world .
i &apos;ve split kenya in its provinces .
don &apos;t jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on .
this red dot marks the great basin of north america , and i &apos;m involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators .
hey ! don &apos;t laugh . that &apos;s my life .
you can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words , and these words occur in sentences .
some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders .
you &apos;ll be seeing one of the most high-performance materials known to man .
flickr is a photo-sharing service that allows people to take photos , upload them , share them over the web and so forth .
you notice we haven &apos;t got everybody who has a photo .
it &apos;s taken over a wider geographic area .
and that sounds strange to our ears , but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors have contributed a below-average amount .
one of the first things that happens when you institutionalize a problem is that the first goal of the institution immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was to self-preservation .
number one group on meetup right now , most chapters in most cities with most members , most active ?
journalism was an answer to an even more important question , which is , how will society be informed ?
right . as with the printing press , if it &apos;s really a revolution , it doesn &apos;t take us from point a to point b .
with whole grain bread , you have other obstacles .
everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is &quot; mise en place , &quot; which is just a french way of saying , &quot; get organized . &quot;
the fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages . again , developing more flavor .
and ultimately , the mystical or sometimes called the &quot; anagogical &quot; level .
not like hot water made cold , or cold water turned hot , but water boiled off and becoming steam .
and as they &apos;re shaped , they &apos;re raised again , all along proving that they &apos;re alive , and developing character .
but we &apos;ve got this bread , and what i did here is to try to , again , evoke even more flavor from this grain , was we &apos;ve added into it the spent grain from beer-making .
you gotta have doorstops , that &apos;s important .
i can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece , &quot; s-tog , &quot; which i made when i was living in copenhagen .
anyway , despite those perils , i would urge you to think about the possibility that you might take on roles in your own work , whether they are neighboring or far-flung from your professional definition .
i tasted the crackers . eww , yuck . &quot;
on the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
so they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
this is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
boy : how about this ?
if you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
and what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
and you can see he looks always the same .
most of them won &apos;t move at all , but some of them might make a tiny step .
so we started the company .
again , a push , now this time from the front .
this is all happening automatically in the simulation .
with this technology , video games will look different and they will feel very different .
torsten reil talks about how the study of biology can help make natural-looking animated people -- by building a human from the inside out , with bones , muscles and a nervous system . he spoke at in 2003 ; see his work now in gta4 .
i went to this very proper christian school taught by nuns , fathers , brothers , sisters .
shake it again , and you get the british perspective .
and then , to have to deal with large groups , say , at the nation-state level , and we had to have mutual non-aggression , or through a series of conflicts , we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace .
and it was quite an experience to be there .
i &apos;d argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers , but we don &apos;t have very good software for them .
if you shine a light on them , they produce electricity .
and john doerr and brook and others got concerned , &#91; unclear &#93; , and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic . and we saw a lot of gaps .
markets are a very strong force .
technologist and futurist bill joy talks about several big worries for humanity -- and several big hopes in the fields of health , education and future tech .
i &apos;m very interested in mars , of course , and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the viking landers landed on mars .
well , if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago what i thought the chances of life on mars would be , i would &apos;ve probably said , a couple of percent .
but it &apos;s probably hiding , because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment , that makes you yummy , and other things might want to eat you , or consume you .
these extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special .
these organisms we now bring into the lab , and you can see some of them growing on petri plates , and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves .
and one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it is to have an intermediary .
did life start here and was it transported there ?
1933 , vera mahler found , when it was acknowledged by others , it felt real in the mind .
now codex c is actually buried in this book .
and he wanted to do this as a matter of principle .
and we imaged the manuscript in 14 different wavebands of light .
and when it takes its place , it sheds electromagnetic radiation .
it &apos;s 17,152 divided into 536 families .
aristotle &apos;s &quot; categories &quot; is one of the foundational texts of western philosophy .
why do they go to see the mona lisa ?
there &apos;s now ample evidence that hardy rodenstock is a con man , and that the jefferson bottles were fakes .
the waiter , you know , came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver , and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said , you know , &quot; would signore like the truffles ? &quot;
these ones gq did spring for -- i own these -- but i will tell you , not only did i not get a compliment from any of you , i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that i have owned and worn these .
it &apos;s a cat that lives in trees , and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations .
to try this one , the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the manhattan showroom .
there &apos;s not much of it left .
thank you .
and by answering that question , i think we can take something extremely powerful away .
now , to try and explain this in sort of real terms , i want to talk about a kind of task that might fall to you in so many games .
but we don &apos;t just do that either .
so what does all this mean in practice ?
the 25 percent . this lights the brain up .
what happened was , they paid each other a virtual currency they called &quot; dragon kill points . &quot;
but it &apos;s also about collective engagement and about the unprecedented laboratory for observing what makes people tick and work and play and engage on a grand scale in games .
it &apos;s a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus .
imagine what we could learn about diseases by studying the history of human disease , from ancient hominids to the present . but how ? fellow christina warinner is an achaeological geneticist , and she &apos;s found a spectacular new tool -- the microbial dna in fossilized dental plaque .
i think about eating a lot , and i really love it .
so i went and stood on a big grain bin in the midwest , and that really didn &apos;t help me understand farming , but i think it &apos;s a really cool picture .
you know , there &apos;s 30-year cycles .
well , if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple , then maybe it &apos;s time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three-quarters of the products being made just from corn , soy and wheat .
and that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided , but we would merely write it off as merely execution .
so , we can change the metaphor . let &apos;s call the trojan horse the vessel by which you get through the gate , get through the constraints of a project .
and eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized thruscenium .
well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture .
now , if you were to take a scoreboard and drop it on dirt and whiskey , that would be bad .
and again , this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built , but at least suggests the ideas .
but we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going , what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with .
as opposed to knowing the whole story , just knowing a little bit of the story , and then letting your own mind fill in the rest .
this provides a slightly more statistical look at things .
last may , i spent nine days living up in barrow , alaska , the northernmost settlement in the united states , with a family of inupiat eskimos , documenting their annual spring whale hunt .
so , how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story ?
and now we &apos;ve whittled down that whole story to just 29 matching photographs , and then we can enter the narrative at that position .
so i &apos;m going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that i did , some of the people i spoke with .
i asked her about that , and she said she meant that she doesn &apos;t want to be married , because , in her opinion , when you get married in bhutan as a woman , your chances to live an independent life kind of end , and so she had no interest in that .
i asked her about her wish , and she said , &quot; you know , maybe i &apos;ll live , maybe i &apos;ll die , but i don &apos;t have a wish . &quot;
thank you .
it &apos;s almost like they &apos;re practicing magic tricks .
and in those days , my hair was down to my waist , i drove a motorcycle , i was unmarried , i owned a bar , so those were different times .
that &apos;s how much of a latterly thing writing is .
it was perfectly natural .
and yet , there it is , so you assume there &apos;s been some kind of hiccup .
sally : &quot; for this summer program at nyu . &quot;
as it happens , he was writing about what had become french .
of course , it &apos;s also a great liberating force that makes possible , you know , publishing and so forth , and standards , and so on .
the last 20 years has been the age of intervention , and afghanistan is simply one act in a five-act tragedy .
furthermore , it &apos;s simply not true that what went wrong in afghanistan is the light footprint .
and mullah mustafa -- he &apos;s the man with the pen and paper -- explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph , nadir shah had bet him that he couldn &apos;t hit me .
or in 2010 , the u.k. foreign secretary , david miliband , who said that at last we would deliver the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
and i could make the same points about the united states and the united nations .
one of the saddest things about our involvement in afghanistan is that we &apos;ve got our priorities out of sync .
thank you .
and the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you , i want to suggest to you , is one in which you say that in order to treat disease you have to first know what you &apos;re treating -- that &apos;s diagnostics -- and then you have to do something .
the brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine , the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine .
there are also dipsticks , but if you look at the dipsticks , they &apos;re for another kind of urine analysis .
now even that &apos;s more complicated than you think .
there &apos;s another very interesting connection here , and that is that what one wants to do is to pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system .
you dip in a corner . the fluid goes into the center .
and we &apos;ve decided that we should think about this not so much in terms of cost , but in terms of simplicity .
now if you look at &apos; 96 , bill clinton -- the last democrat to actually win -- how he did in &apos; 96 , you see real big differences in this part of the country right here , the kind of appalachians , ozarks , highlands region , as i call it : 20 or 30 point swings from how bill clinton did in &apos; 96 to how obama did in 2008 .
meanwhile , california , new york , we can say , &quot; oh we &apos;re enlightened &quot; but you know , certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted , i suppose , manifestation of racially-based voting .
one simple question they asked is , &quot; does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood ? &quot;
i &apos;m a big fan of cities .
she was resuscitated , stabilized , whisked over to a cat scan suite right next to the emergency room , because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung .
bell says , &quot; what sort of crossing did you have on the ferry from burntisland ? &quot;
and so when auenbrugger became a physician , he began to do the same thing .
it &apos;s been on calendars , postage stamps in many different countries .
it had a beautiful facility , giant atrium , valet parking , a piano that played itself , a concierge that took you around from here to there .
and i began my ritual .
and if you shortchange that ritual by not undressing the patient , by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown , by not doing a complete exam , you have bypassed on the opportunity to seal the patient-physician relationship .
we seem to have forgotten -- as though , with the explosion of knowledge , the whole human genome mapped out at our feet , we are lulled into inattention , forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician , necessary for the patient -- forgetting that the ritual has meaning and a singular message to convey to the patient .
no , it -- well , it has kind of a right-leaning bias .
it &apos;s a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena .
on a more serious note , in all of science we &apos;re looking for a balance between data and theory .
and , of course , happy faces .
and then i &apos;m going to finish up with another example of this with audio -- auditory illusions .
but my friend , simon singh , the particle physicist now turned science educator , and he wrote the book &quot; the big bang , &quot; and so on .
the salads that you see at mcdonald &apos;s came from the work -- they &apos;re going to have an asian salad . at pepsi , two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods .
she took her baby to the nearest village clinic , and the doctor advised her to take rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator .
and then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem .
and i &apos;ve been studying it for a couple years .
but one reason is because it indicates a change , from before to after .
and if babies don &apos;t work , you can use doctors .
the point is that you can find ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them , because you want to be connected .
so here are two leaders . they don &apos;t have a lot in common .
what all these people have in common is that they are heretics .
the first one is , who exactly are you upsetting ?
they have curiosity . curiosity about people in the tribe , curiosity about outsiders . they &apos;re asking questions .
using the internet , i found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer , and what i had found shocked me .
and i had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes , and that &apos;s just a long , thin pipe of carbon that &apos;s an atom thick and one 50 thousandth the diameter of your hair .
so i went in that direction .
over 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late , when someone has less than two percent chance of survival . how could this be ? jack andraka talks about how he developed a promising early detection test for pancreatic cancer that &apos;s super cheap , effective and non-invasive -- all before his 16th birthday .
that , by the way is haifa wehbe . she &apos;s a lebanese pop star and pan-arab pin-up girl .
after all , it &apos;s the quran which encourages us to do this : &quot; we made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another . &quot;
so reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship , or what we today like to call a passionate marriage , used to be a contradiction in terms .
desire needs space .
for good reasons , right ?
so when i began to think about eroticism , i began to think about the poetics of sex , and if i look at it as an intelligence , then it &apos;s something that you cultivate .
so i want to draw that little image for you , because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs , we are born with that .
so what happens , if you want to sustain desire , it &apos;s that real dialectic piece .
it was , remarkably , a pretty good sounding room .
okay , africa .
it &apos;s smaller than this .
well , there &apos;s only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers .
there doesn &apos;t need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever , and the sound systems are good .
in other ways , it &apos;s more like the west african music because if the music in an mp3 player gets too quiet , you turn it up , and the next minute , your ears are blasted out by a louder passage .
so that , if somebody can fake sincerity , if they can fake passion , they stand a better chance of being selected in that way , which seems a little dangerous .
and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by , and everybody was upset with him .
now , instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones , israel now had iron plows , and sickles , and hoes and military weapons .
even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle .
that &apos;s the part of us that yearns for god , or something more than we find in technology .
yes , to be sure , science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering .
marilyn monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person , and our -- many young people think she &apos;s still alive .
and he said , for the first time in his life he &apos;d thought about the inevitable , and about god .
he was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics , even as a teenager .
i milked cows every morning , and i had to milk the same cows every evening when i came home from school .
i will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum .
your war drum ain &apos;t louder than this breath . haaa .
we cherish corpses .
one woman shoots her face . one woman shoots her husband .
do not fear what has blown up .
vermiculite was used for soil conditioners , to make plants grow faster and better .
willful blindness is a legal concept which means , if there &apos;s information that you could know and you should know but you somehow manage not to know , the law deems that you &apos;re willfully blind .
and the recurrent theme that i encounter all the time is people say , &quot; well , you know , the people who do see , they &apos;re whistleblowers , and we all know what happens to them . &quot;
i sat in a diner , and i watched as trucks drove up and down the highway , carting away the earth out of gardens and replacing it with fresh , uncontaminated soil .
the women &apos;s chief of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dirty .
she &apos;s highly athletic .
we go into rural communities and all we do , like has been done in this room , is create the space .
these were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman -- i failed , i failed , i failed .
i want to look back 20 years from now and see that there &apos;s another liberian girl , ghanaian girl , nigerian girl , ethiopian girl standing on this ted stage .
leymah gbowee : unlock the intelligence , passion , greatness of girls
licklider encourages us not to take a toaster and make it data from &quot; star trek , &quot; but to take a human and make her more capable .
so the more you look around you , the more you see licklider &apos;s vision everywhere .
for example , terrorism . terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances , and despite what you might see on tv , these adaptations , and the detection of them , are fundamentally human .
the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper , to explore non-obvious hypotheses , and in fact , insights emerged .
now that was the advice that st. benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century .
it &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their dna ; it &apos;s what they do -- even the good , well-intentioned companies .
you can &apos;t do it all in one day .
so i left work an hour early that afternoon and picked harry up at the school gates .
i &apos;d lived in this area all my life , and you could not get to the river because of all the lovely facilities that i &apos;d mentioned earlier .
this comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits .
one of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in westchester county to go to manhattan .
this is lafayette avenue -- and as redesigned by matthews-nielsen landscape architects .
neither the destruction of the ninth ward nor the south bronx was inevitable .
so i don &apos;t have a problem with developers making money .
don &apos;t just talk about it at ted . this is a nationwide policy agenda i &apos;m trying to build , and as you all know , politics are personal .
and that animated graphics can make a difference .
i cover my lifetime here , you know ?
and it moves up with mao tse-tung getting health , not getting so rich .
this is really a change , that you have this lag of more or less 30 , 40 years &apos; difference on the health .
and sweden was like mozambique .
well , you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier -- everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide .
this is what poverty line is -- 80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs , the food for the day .
getting out of poverty .
i only know two types of wine -- red and white .
environment is important .
sword swallowing is from ancient india .
i was happy because these kids were using scratch just in the way that we had hoped that they would .
and that triggered a debate in the u.k .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
so he was learning many different core principles of design , about how to experiment with new ideas , how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts , how to collaborate with other people on your projects , about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong , how to keep persistent and to persevere in the face of frustrations when things aren &apos;t working well .
automobiles are self-moving things , right ? elevators are automobiles .
it &apos;s that will to live , that need to survive , to express itself , that comes in a car , and takes over people like me .
you can understand that . it works in truisms .
i heard today about joseph &apos;s death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction .
and one of the young women in the project , she was a fantastic lady , she actually built her room in the bathroom .
and here i &apos;m expecting at any moment , &quot; ok , they &apos;re going to turn the page , and i &apos;m going to see the cars , i &apos;m going to see the sketches , i &apos;m going to see maybe some idea of where it &apos;s going . &quot;
and i think we felt much closer that day , we cut a lot of strings that didn &apos;t need to be there , and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about .
you might know that , so far in just the dawn of this revolution , we know that there are perhaps 40,000 unique mutations affecting more than 10,000 genes , and that there are 500 of these genes that are bona-fide drivers , causes of cancer .
and those post-it notes involve this and other proteins of its class -- so-called bromodomains .
and he obliged us .
and in fact , this molecule prevents this adipocyte , this fat stem cell , from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet , like the folks in my hometown of chicago , fail to develop fatty liver , which is a major medical problem .
and one thing i &apos;ve learned in boston is that you people will do anything for cancer -- and i love that .
what that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were closer together .
if you have the air in this room , you don &apos;t notice each individual atom .
we want to know -- this is 50 years ago , &quot; surely , &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve figured it out by now . &quot;
so even though time goes on forever , space is limited to us .
well if that &apos;s true , boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern-sounding ideas -- the multiverse and the anthropic principle .
we therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation . &quot;
you might say , &quot; well there &apos;s nothing there to be living , &quot; but that &apos;s not right .
thank you .
my family ate one meal per day , at night .
another machine pumps water for irrigation .
rather than using a keyboard and mouse , why can i not use my computer in the same way that i interact in the physical world ?
but then i realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing .
but i &apos;m more excited that you can actually take it outside .
i removed the microphone from that , and then just pinched that -- like i just made a clip out of the microphone -- and clipped that to a piece of paper , any paper that you found around .
we should have a &apos; fifth sense &apos; for missing-sense people who cannot speak .
i really do believe that mayors have the political position to really change people &apos;s lives .
bird : this is incredible .
so what i &apos;m going to show here is something that was already presented in ted by the former mayor of curitiba who created that , a city in brazil , jaime lerner .
i mean , favelas can sometimes really be a solution , if you deal with them , if you put public policy inside the favelas .
between november and may , rio &apos;s completely packed .
we , at this time of year , get lots of traffic jams .
so the fourth commandment i want to share with you here tonight is , a city of the future has to use technology to be present .
it &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection , and it operates very differently .
how about artistic beauty ?
except , of course , what &apos;s interesting about this is that we can &apos;t be sure how that idea was conveyed , because the homo erectus that made these objects did not have language .
now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself .
we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road .
a good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called airpix .
mark &apos;s going to give me a ride back to the hotel .
it happened 225 years ago .
so , we believe that on europa there is , in fact , a deep ocean .
the sunlight in jupiter , on the satellites of jupiter , is 25 times fainter than it is here , since jupiter is five times as far from the sun .
so , the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps , and shine the headlights , and anything that doesn &apos;t look like a sheep , you shoot .
so , i hope in the next 10 years , we &apos;ll find these creatures , and then , of course , our whole view of life in the universe will change .
so , i went to design school , and it was the early &apos; 90s when i finished .
and then finally , the leaf lamp for herman miller .
but this is the design process : there &apos;s somebody changing the board , putting tracers on the board , changing the location of the ics , as the designers on the other side are doing the work .
in nigeria , people carry their most precious belongings on their heads .
but this is my nephew , anthony , in switzerland , and he had the laptop for an afternoon , and i had to take it back . it was hard .
we can change these values , can change the companies we work with , and eventually , together , maybe we can change the world .
i &apos;m joined by singers from cal state long beach , cal state fullerton and riverside community college , some of the best amateur choirs in the country , and — -- and in the second half of the piece , the virtual choir will join us , 30 different singers from 30 different countries .
much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions .
by 18 , under the excellent tutelage of my mother , i was therefore , as you might expect , defiantly feminist .
he began to come twice a week to my center because women could not go to the mosque .
after the war , lots of these songs were lost , but they are a part of our childhood and our history , and we should not forget them . &quot;
but no , for the protest , they dressed all in white , no makeup .
they &apos;ve also saved me from my righteous anger by offering insights into this third way .
it is in these little stories , these individual stories , that i see a radical epic being written by women around the world .
find me when you can . &quot;
but to take baby steps to get there , first of all we want to look at drug design and production , or drug discovery and manufacturing .
and i noticed this in a very funny way .
maybe it &apos;s a middle eastern culture that became confused with islam .
it should be the citizen &apos;s decision .
but that &apos;s not the case at all .
in the 19th century , when muslims were looking at europe as an example , they were independent ; they were more self-confident .
they see an example , at least , to take some inspiration from .
and some things look very familiar today .
and very quickly cajal realized that neurons don &apos;t operate alone , but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer .
and instead of applying feeble human minds to designing these tools from scratch , there were these ready-made solutions right out there in nature developed and refined steadily for millions of years by the greatest engineer of all .
well , notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the middle east , darfur , iraq , elsewhere , there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news .
the defeat of the tamil tigers in sri lanka is perhaps the most recent example of this , but we have seen similar so-called military solutions in the balkans , in the south caucasus and across most of africa .
the hopes that were vested in the oslo accords did not lead to an end of the israeli / palestinian conflict .
second , diplomacy .
and one of those i &apos;d like to share with you today .
stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen .
life turned hard so it could venture inland .
a world fit for mammals . from tiny shrews &#91; came &#93; tenrecs , accustomed to the dark .
this earth is alive , and it &apos;s made its own membrane .
so my boss wouldn &apos;t let me go and see clients .
so in 2005 , the campaign got more momentum , was more successful in australia and then new zealand , and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point .
but what i &apos;m really pleased to say is , in 2010 , movember became a truly global movement .
and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi , and i didn &apos;t tell him who i was , because i didn &apos;t think it was appropriate , and i just shook his hand and i said , &quot; thank you so much .
and that city can go on and inspire a state , and that state can go on and inspire a nation , and beyond that , you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men &apos;s health .
he began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect , the way of life they needed to nurture .
we &apos;re running out of fossil fuels .
my work has taken me around the world , where i &apos;ve had the real privilege of meeting people like benki and many others who are making change happen in their communities -- people who see the world differently , who are asking different questions , who have different answers , who understand the filters that they wear when they go out into the world .
he lost his wife to aids a couple of years ago , and he &apos;s hiv-positive .
these are pieces that you won &apos;t find anywhere else in the world , in part because they document parts of history chinese choose to forget .
and they have humility .
&apos;the world &apos; is objective , logical , universal , factual , scientific .
perhaps he was a jain monk , like bahubali over here , the gomateshwara bahubali whose image is not far from mysore .
because , you see , the greeks believed you live only once , and when you die , you have to cross the river styx .
because , you see , nothing lasts forever in india , not even death .
you see , what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves ?
and then look at people who have done business in india , you &apos;ll see the exasperation on their faces .
i would give my viewpoints to people .
and you want god to see you , and hence the gods have very large eyes , large unblinking eyes , sometimes made of silver , so they look at you .
you will discover that within infinite myths lies the eternal truth .
when i was five , i thought i was a genius , but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since . &quot; mm ?
&quot; well , i &apos;m interested in this . &quot;
but what that tombstone should have said , in an alternative lifetime , what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent , was , &quot; here lies the last nobel laureate in physics , who formulated the grand unified field theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive . &quot;
says your kid , &quot; i have decided i want to be a magician .
great friend , great spouse , great parent , great career .
her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s .
if the breast is less than 25 percent dense , that &apos;s called fatty-replaced .
the machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive .
this is an image from our first patient .
of the tumors that we found , mammography found only 25 percent of those tumors .
after the fourth rejection , we requested reconsideration of the manuscript , because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology .
for women without dense breasts , mammography is the best choice .
what can we do with just one person &apos;s data ?
so we can make money ?
how do we know what to do with all the power we have if we don &apos;t have a moral framework ?
he wanted to know what is just .
that &apos;s a stunning vision .
it &apos;s not like its relation to some abstract form .
and this goes on for thousands of years , because these are hard questions , and i &apos;ve only got 15 minutes .
in fact , let &apos;s start right now .
and they gathered together because the technologists wanted to learn what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective .
damon horowitz reviews the enormous new powers that technology gives us : to know more -- and more about each other -- than ever before . drawing the audience into a philosophical discussion , horowitz invites us to pay new attention to the basic philosophy -- the ethical principles -- behind the burst of invention remaking our world . where &apos;s the moral operating system that allows us to make sense of it ? &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
you couldn &apos;t really make any money selling marijuana .
so for fifteen minutes , you get this great high .
this is about 1990 -- peak of the crack epidemic .
we really got access to everybody in the gang .
these are the teenagers , typically , who &apos;d be standing out on the street corner , selling the drugs .
this was the best way out .
i think the first one is that they got fooled by history .
you know , he would say to his friends , &quot; hey , look at all the money i got in the gang . &quot;
they &apos;re talking about the decision of why they don &apos;t go shoot -- one thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang , if you go and just shoot in the air -- just shoot guns in the other gang &apos;s territory -- all the people are afraid to go buy their drugs there .
from there i started with skydiving .
2005 i did a base jump from the eiger , from the monk and from the jungfrau , three very famous mountains in switzerland .
ueli gegenschatz : pretty much . i believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly .
so you have to be prepared .
who is the consumer , if you want , and who has responsibility for what one sees ?
is art about that ?
and two summers ago at the hyde park in london , with the serpentine gallery : a kind of a temporal pavilion where moving was the only way you could see the pavilion .
so if i have a sense of the space , if i feel that the space is tangible , if i feel there is time , if there is a dimension i could call time , i also feel that i can change the space .
in assessing the merits of such tales , it &apos;s probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor &apos;s saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins , &quot; once upon a time , &quot; and a sea story begins , &quot; this ain &apos;t no shit . &quot;
ew : it was like it was teasing us , doing a kind of fan dance -- now you see me , now you don &apos;t -- and we had four such teasing appearances , and then on the fifth , it came in and totally wowed us .
and that &apos;s a poem by charles edward carryl , who was a stockbroker in new york city for 45 years , but in the evenings , he wrote nonsense for his children .
and the answer was no , which i found in the london times archive .
now , you &apos;ve been kind and ... i &apos;m going to sing this to bill gates .
because you have to understand , in israel we don &apos;t talk with people from iran .
the day after , iranians started to respond with their own posters .
the moment i really understood that something was happening , a friend of mine told me , &quot; google the word &apos; israel . &apos; &quot; and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google when you were typing , &quot; israel &quot; or &quot; iran . &quot;
so a few weeks ago , the stress is getting higher , so we start this new campaign called &quot; not ready to die in your war . &quot;
when war between israel and iran seemed imminent , israeli graphic designer ronny edry shared a poster on facebook of himself and his daughter with a bold message : &quot; iranians ... we &#91; heart &#93; you . &quot; other israelis quickly created their own posters with the same message -- and iranians responded in kind . the simple act of communication inspired surprising facebook communities like &quot; israel loves iran , &quot; &quot; iran loves israel &quot; and even &quot; palestine loves israel . &quot;
we mate them . they have sort of mutant offspring .
so the people &apos;s building , as we called it .
the great wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon .
so we can actually hitch a ride for free .
and they form this sort of vertical backyard where , on a nice summer day , you &apos;ll actually get introduced to all your neighbors in a vertical radius of 10 meters .
so , the mountain is like our first built example of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy .
and all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater is filtered organically into the landscape , gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green , lush landscape .
there are several million people dying of hiv and aids .
and also -- and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil -- to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
and so basically , this has been the copenhagen consensus &apos; process .
then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
if we invest about 12 billion dollars , we could make a severe inroad into that problem .
even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the u.n .
so it doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re actually on the path of suddenly solving all big problems .
to start thinking about saying , &quot; let &apos;s do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good , at very low cost , right now . &quot;
that if you live in the best climate , in san diego in the united states , or in the shittiest climate , in buffalo , new york , you are going to be just as happy in either place .
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons , it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more dennises becoming dentists and there are more paulas who are married to paul than statistically viable .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about typography , even though we worked with those animals not so successfully .
after about three days , the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid .
and in fact , cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark .
thank you very much .
bao yongxiu : &quot; my mother tells me to come home and get married , but if i marry now , before i have fully developed myself , i can only marry an ordinary worker , so i &apos;m not in a rush . &quot;
many articles calculate : how long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he &apos;s making ?
once , when min &apos;s older sister &apos;s friend got married , she brought a handbag along as a wedding present .
thank you .
i want you to watch a short video from my latest documentary film , &quot; children of the taliban . &quot;
they rely very heavily on teachers , who i have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to .
he killed 28 .
and we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported .
and then this happened .
you can you hold them in your hand . they &apos;re like a garden hose .
and then , once it was in the right place , he got back in the water holding a big knife , and he cut each buoy off , and the buoy popped up into the air , and the cable dropped to the sea floor , and he did that all the way out to the ship , and when he got there , they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie , and then he jumped back in , and he swam back to shore , and then he lit a cigarette .
because typically they &apos;ve been too inefficient , inaccessible , they &apos;ve not been fast enough , they &apos;ve been quite expensive .
and this was built by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer in layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness -- slowly growing this structure .
typically an implant is more effective within the body if it &apos;s more porous , because our body tissue will grow into it .
which means that we can now present to the public the next generation of customization .
you can see , this came out of the machine in one piece and the electronics were inserted later .
it is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the koran .
they had never paid him any attention before -- old man , small mosque -- but now they began to pay visits , and sometimes they would drag him in for questions , and always the same question : &quot; why did you name your granddaughter jihad ?
usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism , or it &apos;s a power struggle .
there lie the answers to the solution to local jihad .
and the arab spring has produced governments , many of them islamist governments , who know that , for their own self-preservation , they need to take on the extremists in their midsts .
and it &apos;s known for prostitution , violence , drugs : a hard place to grow up .
she had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization , jamii bora , that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were , as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings .
i said , &quot; well what about your dreams ? &quot;
this was part of a challenge i did to take a picture every day for a month .
when i gave up sugar for 30 days , day 31 looked like this .
i wasn &apos;t able to keep up with the business , and i ended up with a 25-year detour .
of course , inexpensive microprocessors and then a very important breakthrough -- genetic algorithms .
and you can buy stepper motors that pretty much never wear out because they have no brushes , for a dollar .
so we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way , because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around .
we built engines -- so we built 100 different engines over the last two years .
the way the unit works is , when the sun comes out the engine will start and you get power out here .
it &apos;s just how many watts do you get per dollar , and how could you benefit from that using that power to change your life in some way .
bill gross : a solar energy system that tracks the sun
but still , we look at the pieces .
and as a body of knowledge builds up , it will form one subsection , or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the ipcc , although we have others .
and i decided that i wanted to tell -- but i still wanted to tell a narrative story and i still wanted to tell my stories .
but the painting reflects -- i don &apos;t think differently for children than i do for adults .
and david remnick , who was really wonderful about it , had one problem . he didn &apos;t like al zheimers , because he thought it would insult people with alzheimer &apos;s .
who knows ? the new york timesselect , the op-ed page , asked me to do a column , and they said , you can do whatever you want .
and my mother drew this map for me of the united states of america , and that is my dna over here , because that person who i grew up with had no use for facts whatsoever .
and so , you know , i talk to my friends and i go to plays where they &apos;re singing russian songs .
and i wonder what the point is and then i know , and i see that hy meyerowitz , rick meyerowitz &apos;s father , a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the bronx , won the charlie chaplin look-alike contest in 1931 .
it more felt to be the case to me that i was being treated like a statue , and i was to sit in one place like a statue would .
of course , in muslim , because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry , you don &apos;t find as many physical representations of divinity or of spiritual liberation as you do in the buddhist tradition , where , of course , there are many statues of the buddha that are highly revered .
hh : thank you very much .
and you can see these robots are not ready to take over the world yet , but they gradually learn how to move forward , and they do this autonomously .
and we &apos;ve actually built a couple of these , and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes .
it &apos;s one of the most lethal things we &apos;ve seen in circulation in the world in any recent centuries .
this is not your normal garden-variety flu .
and the bottom line , major thing that has come through in every single drill : nobody knows who &apos;s in charge .
but what about the no-brainer things ? should we close all the schools ?
and here is the other interesting thing : when a human being ingests tamiflu , only 20 percent is metabolized appropriately to be an active compound in the human being .
we don &apos;t actually know how many people died .
it probably does reduce exposure because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other , or touching common objects and sharing things via their hands .
we have absolutely no idea what that would do .
and that most people who die of regular flu -- which in regular flu years is about 360,000 people worldwide , most of them senior citizens -- and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system .
so this is the motor .
eighteen minutes , clearly impossible .
two years later , one -- zoop .
these are rejects . they are completely out of alignment .
i was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection .
so after the walk people ask me , &quot; how can you top that ? &quot;
eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley .
and something happened .
i used to climb trees for fun all the time and now , as a grown-up , i have made my profession understanding trees and forests , through the medium of science .
and these mosses , generated by decomposing , are like peat moss in your garden .
here in 2009 , you know , it &apos;s not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist , gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them .
they danced in the forest , and we are taking this dance , my scientific outreach communications , and also linking up with environmental groups , to go to different cities and to perform the science , the dance and the environmental outreach that we hope will make a difference .
they were very enthusiastic .
when we come to understand nature , we are touching the most deep , the most important parts of our self .
and i &apos;ve got to tell you , i wasn &apos;t that hopeful , because i &apos;d seen the establishment . i thought , it always sticks together . i am out of luck .
it &apos;s the system by which we organize and exercise power , and there i &apos;m talking about politics , because in politics , we &apos;re back to this system , this top-down hierarchy .
it reminded me of that scene in &quot; the wizard of oz . &quot;
there was no evidence . he presented no evidence of that .
and more exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo was a guy named jack randall , the greatest living ichthyologist on earth , the grand poobah of fish nerds , if you will .
the nitrogen has two problems .
now , as we breathe , we produce carbon dioxide , and that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system .
there &apos;s a just-unbelievable diversity .
sharks are actually not very dangerous animals and that &apos;s why we weren &apos;t worried much , why we were joking around down there .
when we first found it , we weren &apos;t even sure what family this thing belonged to , so we just called it the dr. seuss fish , because it looked like something out of one of those books .
if you live your whole life in fear -- i mean , life is a sexually transmitted disease with 100 percent mortality .
and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it , instead of in brain research , towards diagnosing brain disorders in children .
but we are now in a new era of neuroscience , one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects , non-invasively , and find the true source of so many disabilities in children .
he built the capital over there .
and you know , when i knew him when i was in the office , he would come in from a trip , and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely , and he would pack up and go .
in 30 , 50 years back , it was nothing , only paddy fields , and since we invited him here , he felt that he has got a responsibility .
the story of humans is the story of ideas -- scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners , ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally , ideas for which we &apos;ve lived and died and killed and been killed , ideas that have vanished in history , and ideas that have been set in dogma .
our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances , and theirs might be as well .
it takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us .
we are not the determined product of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning .
it &apos;s making silicon as important as aluminum , and we &apos;ll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350 for more sensitivity and leveraging moore &apos;s law for more processing capability .
and this is a technically creative challenge , and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it .
this past january , i traveled to a place called wais divide , about 600 miles from the south pole .
they cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs , some 8,000 miles from the drill site .
they have to , in fact , make sure this ice never gets warmer than about 20 degrees below zero , otherwise , the key gases inside it will dissipate .
if , of course , that were true , there would be no innovation , and nobody could make any money .
the point here is , these cars are going to be made super efficient .
they make a little net money for the treasury .
and it &apos;s obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to avoid wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels .
they snap together like a kid &apos;s toy .
you are paid to pick efficiency within a size class , in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen years of life-cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three .
and make the transition to more efficient vehicles go faster .
there &apos;s six billion dollars on the table .
we launched two titles in october -- &quot; rockett &apos;s new school &quot; -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place , with a blank slate , which allows girls to play with the question of , &quot; what will i be like when i &apos;m older ? &quot;
and sometimes i feel like i can &apos;t really enjoy myself unless it &apos;s like a vacation , like when i get mondays and all those days off .
i could get invited to that party any day if i wanted to .
this is hermann goering .
he had a lesser charge of forgery , got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people .
i want to convince you that humans are , to some extent , natural born essentialists .
in front of them on a screen is information about the wine .
after she got it , &quot; she was happy to report that she has discovered that he possessed a double who was rich , virile , handsome and aristocratic . &quot;
but what really causes an effect is you tell people , &quot; look , you could resell it , you could boast about it , but before it gets to you , it &apos;s thoroughly washed . &quot;
when this came out on television , the value of her art dropped to nothing .
and how you think about what you &apos;re experiencing , your beliefs about the essence of it , affect how it hurts .
and it &apos;s best understood through example as the science of those crazy , wacky newspaper headlines .
this is somebody called dr. gillian mckeith ph.d , or , to give her full medical title , gillian mckeith .
and they very helpfully tell you how to go and find the paper .
the kids got the pills , and then their performance improved .
you can also rig your data by making the thing you compare your new drug against really rubbish .
and a funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have disappeared , have gone missing in action .
around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld , but it goes way beyond that .
and i tell them , &quot; it &apos;s the study of the way in which human beings are shaped by things that they don &apos;t see . &quot;
and back in china , what do they say in china ?
and sometimes you even watch satellite , cnn , from the united states .
and back home , what do you see ?
you can &apos;t help but think that .
they do wonderful things , but they also do the bad things , and you can &apos;t tell the difference .
and the americans : &quot; ah , he &apos;s a knucklehead .
and look at this : they even teach their kids -- they train them in the same way the u.s. marines train .
so everyone &apos;s back in the room , okay .
these gentlemen here , they &apos;re insurgents .
you &apos;re allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being .
and they threw up walls -- political walls , trade walls , transportation walls , communication walls , iron curtains -- which divided peoples and nations .
and over the next 18 years have almost tripled .
if you had to choose , which would you rather have : the common disease or the rare disease ?
well , more idea creators .
this means we all benefit when another country gets rich .
here is gdp per capita from 1900 to 1929 .
but jefferson wasn &apos;t quite right , was he ?
in so doing , i reached a frontier of biology so strange , so rich , that it seemed as though it exists on another planet .
and i &apos;d like to show it .
i found my magical ants , but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native cuban forests hung on , and were then -- and still are -- being cut back .
and we need that knowledge .
e.o. wilson : my wish : build the encyclopedia of life
this was an animal that basically kept the forest mixed with grasslands across the entire europe and asian continent , from spain to korea .
well that &apos;s what happens in normal hybridization anyway .
there &apos;s three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species , they &apos;re recreating extinct ecosystems in northern siberia , in the netherlands , and in hawaii .
ben novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting .
that &apos;s how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors .
thank you .
i was the cousin oliver of the sitcom of the krosoczka family , the new kid who came out of nowhere .
and it was a story that was told with words and pictures , exactly what i do now for a living , and i sometimes let the words have the stage on their own , and sometimes i allowed the pictures to work on their own to tell the story .
so how did i make friends ?
and after begging and pleading for christmas , i got a second-hand video camera , and i instantly started making my own animations on my own , and all throughout high school i made my own animations .
and i said , &quot; yes , i have a job . i write and illustrate children &apos;s books . &quot;
and for him , it &apos;s only his second .
they use these to design with and they design for them , which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this — — and sound like this , shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion , or why we get on airplanes -- -- which cost 200 million pounds , with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system , making us jump out of our skins .
old-fashioned classrooms suffer too .
out of that conference , incidentally , also came a free app which is designed to help children study if they &apos;re having to work at home , for example , in a noisy kitchen .
and well , of course , the dutch can &apos;t eat all these pigs .
and in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts , like chocolate mousse , tiramisu , vanilla pudding , everything that &apos;s cooled in the supermarket , there &apos;s gelatin to make it look good .
and can you send me a bullet ? &quot;
thank you very much .
you ever thought about that ?
i deserve the education that i get here .
and when my mama died two years ago at 92 , there were so many former students at her funeral , it brought tears to my eyes , not because she was gone , but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear .
the world wide web , the french are told , ought to be referred to as &quot; la toile d &apos;araignee mondiale &quot; -- the global spider web -- recommendations that the french gaily ignore .
so a tempting generalization for a child , for an adult , for a computer is that any verb that can appear in the construction , &quot; subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient &quot; can also be expressed as &quot; subject-verb-recipient-thing . &quot;
you can think of this as the language of thought , or &quot; mentalese . &quot;
now , i &apos;m sure most of you have seen the movie &quot; fargo . &quot;
if two friends have a reciprocal transaction , like selling a car , it &apos;s well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness .
so you get the best of both worlds .
but those aren &apos;t the important arguments .
so we have these models -- argument as war , argument as proof , and argument as performance .
suppose you and i have an argument .
there &apos;s no magic wand that &apos;s going to make it disappear .
they paddle faster , and faster , and faster , until they &apos;re going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water , and they &apos;re standing upright , sort of paddling the top of the water .
so the same sort of a process , without the proteins , is happening on the inside of their pipes . they didn &apos;t know .
so the hardware is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success .
the two groups are not talking to each other .
what &apos;s interesting , again , is that it self-assembles .
the one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air , does not drink fresh water .
but what i am going to do is tell you that the most important thing , besides all of these adaptations , is the fact that these organisms have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do while taking care of the place that &apos;s going to take care of their offspring .
life -- and this is the secret trick ; this is the magic trick -- life creates conditions conducive to life .
business , she said , was critical to her country &apos;s future .
but think about this .
the great news is we already know what works .
and when we talk about women , they are either exceptions to be dismissed or aberrations to be ignored .
thank you very much .
because , not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world , but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices .
now , if i compare that to a cotton towel that i can use a thousand times , i don &apos;t have a whole lot of embodied energy until i wash that yogurty towel .
and then we poured a big foundation for passive solar .
but my elephant in the living room flies .
and as i started looking at them , i was finding that they had hyper-adapted .
here , she &apos;s trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube .
so -- the moral being , don &apos;t piss off crows .
so that &apos;s what we did .
they figure it &apos;s gotta have more to it .
so this is his answer about a defining moment in american history .
you know , you see , you &apos;ve got to question the official truth .
maxine greene , who &apos;s a wonderful philosopher who &apos;s as old as studs , and was the head of a philosophy -- great , big philosophy kind of an organization -- i went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn &apos;t know , that she still wants to know .
and i ended up with three children , houston , myesha and dominic , who was four months old when i came to jail .
i was so petrified and so numb , all i could look was in the rear-view mirror .
until 1992 , i used to believe america was the best -- i still do ; i don &apos;t deny that because i am a victim .
but after the riot , it &apos;s too much difference .
i mean , confidence is like , you know , you &apos;ve been on that bull before ; you know you can ride him .
but there were three problems , three enigmas that i could not solve , and i want to share with you those problems , but most importantly , i think i figured out a proposal for a solution .
&quot; my grandfather worked at this factory .
in fact , i was in china to see what they were doing , and they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that i was with , and i was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations and standing next to one of the chinese officials , and we were watching , and he says , &quot; so , gov , when do you think the u.s. is going to get national energy policy ? &quot;
and it fosters innovation at the state level in these laboratories of democracy .
now most media companies -- television , radio , publishing , games , you name it -- they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences .
that &apos;s easier for them to find out than who you are .
this is a very important thing to know about people .
i &apos;ll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is .
it &apos;s a very strange world inside a nanotube .
bear in mind this was an ultrasound , so it would have been moving images .
but afterwards she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside .
you know ? you can get cadavers if you work at a university . &quot;
marriage-manual author and semen-sniffer theodoor van de velde -- has a line in his book .
this one involves men .
okay . now i said -- when i was in denmark , my host was named anne marie .
and the woman would have sex with it .
on the night of june 11th , 2003 , he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the manhattan bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below .
now i know that seems ludicrous .
this is a little hard for children , but i think you can handle it .
and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day .
i &apos;ll just quote from the specification .
in the end , one has a list with which one then can arrange .
here we have the fur cup by meret oppenheim .
it should imagine a user .
my life , at the mercy of good design and bad design .
intent changes the picture completely .
anyway , in vitro technology , ivf , is about as intentional as agriculture .
in school , i studied nothing close to design or engineering ; i studied useless things like the classics , but there were some lessons even there -- this guy , plato , it turns out he &apos;s a designer .
people were carrying off vehicles , carrying off pieces of buildings .
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circumstances : living with intent .
the road dropped and i exited jerusalem .
i decided to find abed , and when i finally did , he responded to my hebrew hello which such nonchalance , it seemed he &apos;d been awaiting my phone call .
were we instead our bodies , their inborn endowments and deficits ?
and as i sat contemplating what to say , a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe .
no , i was quiet . i was quiet because i had not come for truth .
&quot; um , abed , &quot; i said , &quot; i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash . &quot;
if you are mindful of what you do not have , you may be truly mindful of what you do have , and if the gods are kind , you may truly enjoy what you have .
so the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines , and not just sentience , but empathy .
one , the perception of people , and two , the natural interface , the natural form of the interface , so that it &apos;s more intuitive for you to interact with the robot .
someone invited me to a meeting , but couldn &apos;t manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , &quot; i have to walk my dogs tomorrow . could you come then ? &quot;
so having seen this danger to the economy , i thought , we need to find a solution to this problem .
so i had to find a different method , preferably involving total strangers .
for example , for all the tedtalks around food , someone summed this up into : &quot; food shaping body , brains and environment , &quot; which i think is pretty good .
thank you very much .
here &apos;s the surprise : they found that the expansion is not slowing down .
so hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as i now go on to tell you three key things about string theory .
the list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500 .
an early example comes from the great astronomer johannes kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number -- why the sun is 93 million miles away from the earth .
instead the fuel not only generated our big bang , but it would also generate countless other big bangs , each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes .
which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration .
and there was a huge row online about , &quot; hey , this can &apos;t be real . &quot;
so , he &apos;s discovering the garden .
dimitri : go on , milo . squash it .
try hitting the boat .
they &apos;re always getting stressed .
thank you very much indeed .
i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes .
and that was just a small percentage of the dead .
i &apos;m not even a humanitarian aid doctor , and i can &apos;t tell you the times of how helpless i &apos;ve felt to have people dying in front of me , and i couldn &apos;t save them .
we are doing a thousand now .
and to our shock , that &apos;s exactly what aurora did .
and he &apos;s sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain .
so where are we taking all this ?
actually , one indication is that little boy on my husband &apos;s shoulders has just graduated from high school .
she went to vocational school for accounting .
well , you know this latter group , you &apos;re wrong .
the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution , not the problem .
in niger , one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth .
she has become part of the solution , not the problem .
which brings me to the final element , which is education .
look : u.s. aid , helping people is not easy , and there have been books that have criticized u.s. aid .
she never broke down .
now god , angered at this attempt to usurp his power , destroyed the tower , and then to ensure that it would never be rebuilt , he scattered the people by giving them different languages -- confused them by giving them different languages .
now if we make some guesses about how long homo erectus lived , what their generation time was , that &apos;s about 40,000 generations of parents to offspring , and other individuals watching , in which that hand axe didn &apos;t change .
social learning really is visual theft .
so what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads , and you walk up to the one that can &apos;t speak very well , and you put the arrowheads down in front of him , hoping that he &apos;ll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows .
now you might say , well , this is just natural .
and they impose a barrier to cooperation .
mark pagel : this is a very good question .
but in fact , they &apos;re growing faster .
and the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
ken went and ran his models , and found that it did .
so it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere , about 100 kilometers up , that already have this effect .
one knob is the knob for controlling global temperature .
you might argue about the sanity of it , but the leverage is real .
should we do serious research on this topic ?
photography threatens fantasy .
this is a 21-year-old palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty .
this one is almost humorous because it feels like i could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut .
and you can see the photoetched brass detailing , and the painted acrylic facade .
a victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement &apos;s use of images .
he ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery .
now , there was nothing particularly special about 2010 , because , on average , 31 and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year .
sounds like a great idea , but how do you make it real ?
when i was in elementary school , my next door neighbor , he gave me a book for my birthday .
we have dawn orbiting vesta , and we have over here new horizons on a straight shot to pluto .
i &apos;m going to pull out , and i want to show you voyager 1 as it flies by saturn .
we are wired to pursue happiness , not only to enjoy it , but to want more and more of it .
and freud in part reflects the anatomy of the human emotion system -- which is that we have both a positive and a negative system , and our negative system is extremely sensitive .
so when people &apos;s symptoms go away , they tend to recur , because there isn &apos;t a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure , happiness , compassion , gratitude , what are the positive emotions .
and it starts in the ventral tegmental area .
there is something very restorative about nature , and it &apos;s part of how we are tuned .
see the problem is that , as humans , these three can separate .
and sure enough , if you look at the kinds of values that come in , you see wealth , adventure , achievement , pleasure , fun , be respected , before the change , and much more post-materialist values after .
i quit my job to focus on the real world problem : landmines .
moreover , they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it .
eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology .
and by doing so , very fast , we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive , which are negative .
and to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable work .
these neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action .
so that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular type of tool , instead of dying out , this spread rapidly , horizontally across the population , or was transmitted vertically , down the generations .
and this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense .
hp : yr : the only problem with masking it with chinese mandarin is i can only speak this paragraph , which i have learned by heart when i was visiting in china .
yr : good advice , but i still think that we learn who we are by copying others .
it doesn &apos;t always go as you plan it , even with a talented translator .
here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen .
now , it &apos;s much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding .
it &apos;s being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made , where banknotes have come from , to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did .
and you see the female line since 1984 , the gap is widening .
it &apos;s not happening , and it &apos;s time .
it told us about hormone replacement therapy .
they &apos;re often not recognized , sent home .
so we are working now on a non-invasive -- again , these are all invasive studies .
and that is female-pattern and why we think the yentl syndrome actually is explaining there &apos;s been wonderful news also about studying women , finally , in heart disease .
we &apos;ve worked on this for 15 years .
i work with really amazing , little , itty-bitty creatures called cells .
so this brings me to lesson number one : life can do a lot with very little .
thank you .
in order to convert this opaque , 90,000 hours of video into something that we could start to see , we use motion analysis to pull out , as we move through space and through time , what we call space-time worms .
and what we found was this curious phenomena , that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum , making language as simple as possible , and then slowly ascend back up in complexity .
what we &apos;d like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they &apos;re learned -- so in other words , the relationship between words and what they &apos;re about in the world .
and michael fleischman was another ph.d. student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis , and he made the following observation : that &quot; just the way that we &apos;re analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language , that same idea we can take out of your home , deb , and we can apply it to the world of public media . &quot;
we call this a co-viewing clique , a virtual living room if you will .
he &apos;s five years old . he &apos;s not going to understand this . &quot;
and the big viz is a collection of 650 sketches that were made by two visual artists .
so if you look around the stage here you &apos;ll create a kind of mental map of the stage .
first , use images to clarify what we &apos;re trying to communicate .
and then thirdly , making them persistent .
this is a laundry chute , and this right here is a shoe last .
where do you get lumpy tiles ? well , of course , you don &apos;t .
that &apos;s not a cell phone .
that &apos;s where we want the picture . right . perfect . &quot;
i got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew . it &apos;s time for you to go . &quot;
nothing wrong with that , unless you ask it to do what 12-gauge wire &apos;s supposed to do , and that &apos;s what happens .
then a man named jean-paul sartre wrote a book titled &quot; being and nothingness . &quot;
we do what that group does that we &apos;re trying to identify with .
what a moron . &quot;
this is los angeles , california , where i live .
now you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in india , in madhya pradesh , there &apos;s one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found .
i discovered during my recovery the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide .
neurological damage , 10 years of rehab , requires a long-term perspective .
and then i creep up to the point that i get a score of 79 , which is just below average .
two elements that worked for me here are -- the first is 90 percent , i learned , of head and neck pain is through muscular-skeletal imbalance .
and in the following months and years , i felt the neurological flow of life itself returning .
and when i came out of my coma , i recognized my family , but i didn &apos;t remember my own past .
that little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on .
the audience is too small .
because my students , what they said when they looked upon the world , and i asked them , &quot; what do you really think about the world ? &quot;
let me make a comparison directly between the united states of america and vietnam .
and when it burst , the size of its country bubble is the size of the population .
you have to invest in health . you have to get kids into schooling .
we cannot give the data free to the students , free to the entrepreneurs of the world . &quot;
it &apos;s as if the world is flattening off , isn &apos;t it ? these countries are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year , as i would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data . thank you very much .
you know chromosomes , but this was a molecule , and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form . and there was the big question of , how did you copy the information ?
and within a day , we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of dna .
actually , linus didn &apos;t look at them that carefully .
i went in and showed them a pairing i &apos;d done , and jerry donohue -- he was a chemist -- he said , it &apos;s wrong .
but there is what we did when we didn &apos;t know where to go forward : we formed a club and called it the rna tie club .
and what you can do is sort of compare dna of normal segs versus cancer .
and we thought we &apos;d probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture . but as you can see , there &apos;s seven out of 20 had a change which was very high .
wrong .
it came back signed .
so unfortunately i &apos;m not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem .
they acted sweet .
the girls were dressed in their sunday best , and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties .
i want to share with you over the next 18 minutes a pretty incredible idea .
and it happened so fast in the united states , however , that even just last month jon stewart said this : jon stewart : where is polio still active ?
we &apos;re not trying to get it down to just a few cases , because this disease is like a root fire ; it can explode again if you don &apos;t snuff it out completely .
even then , kids need many doses of the vaccine .
and then , by 1999 , one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide -- proof of concept .
umar was paralyzed for life .
the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had , and we immediately started using this .
now we &apos;re in tough times economically .
b it &apos;s interesting .
now i &apos;m destined to spend a lot of time with some unique , very , very special , individualistic and often seductive female characters .
but we &apos;ve managed to find that these lions are 15 percent bigger than any others , and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water .
we &apos;re on the edge through a large part of the time .
so we knew we had to react quickly .
dj : so at this stage , i guess , we had very , very firm ideas on what conservation meant .
bj : and you have to know that , when a male lion is killed , it completely disrupts the whole pride .
i suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of , or can be dreamed of , in any philosophy . &quot;
so it would seem the hardest , solidest , densest rock is really almost entirely empty space , broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn &apos;t count .
a small insect would reverse these priorities .
the nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are .
a marble statue could wave its hand at us ; the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway .
what we say -- and i include the most austerely mechanistic among us , which is probably me -- what we say is , &quot; vile monster , prison is too good for you . &quot;
later on , i earned an mba at stanford .
for example , if either of us wants to go 60 miles an hour , both of us will need an assistive device called a car .
all right , we still have a little ways to go with that , but i think it shows the promise .
so , if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics beginning with the observations of resonance , by da vinci , galileo , the english scientist robert hook and then ernest chladni .
and we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature .
i believed the photographers and so did millions of other americans .
it turns out that , not only is the galvao parrot very attractive , useful for headdresses , it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties , which means that there &apos;s a terrible problem with galvao abuse .
and you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that twitter is in fact a very heavily brazilian space .
now , negroponte has been right about a lot of things .
when we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start realizing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
in the u.k. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session , you could read a newspaper from india or from australia , from canada , god forbid from the u.s .
one of those dark spots is madagascar , a country which is generally better known for the dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there .
my guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say .
and you can listen to her as well , if this is a way that you &apos;re interested in having your web widened .
he trains with them for a week , and he plays a match with them .
but how can i tell an eight-year-old boy that his father is a politician ? &quot;
there is a sunni sheikh , there &apos;s a shiite sheikh , there &apos;s the seven -- leaders of the seven major tribes , there &apos;s a christian , there &apos;s a sabian , there are female representatives , there &apos;s every political party in this council , what &apos;s wrong with the people that we chose ? &quot;
that can mean different things in different countries .
fortune cookie .
so , another dish . one of my favorites . beef with broccoli .
i like to say chop suey &apos;s the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another , because chop suey , if you translate into chinese , means tsap sui , which , if you translate back , means &quot; odds and ends . &quot;
so it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights .
so whatever it was , it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way .
so , what i like to say , you know , this being sort of bay area , silicon valley -- is that we think of mcdonald &apos;s as sort of the microsoft of the dining experiences .
so what we see in the seventeenth , eighteenth century is the continued search for medications other than camphor that &apos;ll do the trick .
bones were broken . especially in old , fragile people , you couldn &apos;t use it .
and my colleagues , who had known me since medical school in that place , said , &quot; don &apos;t worry , chap . six weeks , you &apos;re back in the operating room . everything &apos;s going to be great . &quot;
it was impossible . so they decided there was no therapy , there was no treatment . but there was one treatment , which actually had been pioneered at the hartford hospital in the early 1940s , and you can imagine what it was . it was pre-frontal lobotomy .
i could blow the depression away .
so , i &apos;m not free of all of this . but it &apos;s worked . it &apos;s always worked .
thank you so much , prime minister , that was both fascinating and quite inspiring .
and it &apos;s one of his first outings as vice president to an african country .
but i &apos;m trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity open to us that was never open to us before .
so , i come back to my initial point .
you &apos;re saying that you must , and you have a duty to help those countries that cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves .
and the story is told that bill clinton went to god and he asked when there will be successful climate change and a low carbon economy .
and it &apos;s technological , so it can do things like microelectronics , and maybe photonics do .
and the image of the dvd here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface , which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale .
so you think of alternative mechanical parts .
so that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together -- and deliver drugs at the same , while your bone is healing , for example .
the bot , our rising celebrity , also has his own twitter account : @ robotinthewild .
you guys are looking good out there .
there is a silence , and the operator hears a shot .
you understand &quot; forged currency , &quot; &quot; forged pictures . &quot;
i heard him come in .
i managed to convince him that it was important for us , but possibly also for other people that he shared his story .
as a &quot; dyer , &quot; do you know how to bleach ink marks ?
if he had accepted payment , he wouldn &apos;t be able to say &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause .
in africa there were countries fighting for their independence : guinea , guinea-bissau , angola .
he &apos;s still dreaming about it .
the only phase , as we know it that can support humanity .
a trigger and the system tips over , loses its resilience , soft corals take over , and we get undesired systems that cannot support economic and social development .
but we also include , what we call , the slow variables , the systems that , under the hood , regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet -- the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet , land use change , rate of biodiversity loss , freshwater use , functions which regulate biomass on the planet , carbon sequestration , diversity .
this is a new paradigm .
we know that we have to move from our fossil dependence very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time .
when you think about -- you know , creativity has a lot to do with causality too .
because when i decided to go into advertising , i wanted to do -- i wanted to airbrush naked people on ice , for whiskey commercials , that &apos;s what i really wanted to do .
but i was still working with sculpture , and i was really trying to go flatter and flatter .
i got some photographs from them .
they end up being very large pictures , and i photographed with a very large camera -- an 8x10 camera .
because it &apos;s not about fooling somebody , it &apos;s actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief : how much you want to be fooled .
so we can now , in a matter of hours , determine a whole human genome .
but we can then ask : are there any absolute differences between africans and non-africans ?
so this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the dna , how you convert it to a form you can sequence .
and further back , 800,000 years ago is there a common origin with present day humans .
sharing the results of a massive , worldwide study , geneticist svante pääbo shows the dna proof that early humans mated with neanderthals after we moved out of africa . he also shows how a tiny bone from a baby finger was enough to identify a whole new humanoid species .
it doesn &apos;t . it begins with the beginning of life .
we now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism .
i remember when i interacted with that 15-month-older , that the thing that came to mind was , &quot; how do you come into her world ?
now , we thought that those data were so powerful in a way , that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life , because if you interact with a two- and a three-month-older , you &apos;d be surprised by how social those babies are .
it was a routine training jump , like many more i &apos;d done since i became a paratrooper 27 years before .
i &apos;m probably going to jump .
so you look around , where you &apos;re going to land , you try to make yourself ready .
and i was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful ; they didn &apos;t lie , cheat , steal or abandon their comrades .
a 22-year-old individual operating alone , thousands of miles from me , has got to communicate to me with confidence .
and yet , we need to have that shared sense .
you may know one line of it , it says , &quot; i &apos;ll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy . &quot;
four-star general stanley mcchrystal shares what he learned about leadership over his decades in the military . how can you build a sense of shared purpose among people of many ages and skill sets ? by listening and learning -- and addressing the possibility of failure .
harlem now , sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century , looking both backwards and forwards ...
i named this group of artists around an idea , which i put out there called post-black , really meant to define them as artists who came and start their work now , looking back at history but start in this moment , historically .
that &apos;s what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world .
most importantly , we have the motive : we have a world that needs fixing , and nobody &apos;s going to do it for us .
a study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent gdp increases across africa .
the key components are already widely available .
we &apos;d have a far better -- far better knowledge of what &apos;s happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone .
i basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in new delhi .
after that , i started to experiment with various other things that they might learn to do on their own .
i mean , if there &apos;s stuff on google , why would you need to stuff it into your head ?
it took me three years to publish that .
in gateshead , i took 32 children and i started to fine-tune the method .
because their teachers say that after the session is over , the children continue to google further .
if they want , they can call the granny cloud .
a self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside .
and these 20 old men who i &apos;d seen before all of a sudden stood up in these full warrior costumes with the headdress and the spears , and no one was in the square , and i was hidden in the shadows .
if i were to reduce this entire story into one image , what would it be ? &quot;
so now i &apos;m going to show you some clips from the other big project of my life this year , &quot; the tempest . &quot;
ariel : i have made you mad .
manhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either .
i know you &apos;ve all been there .
and it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language , and how what we call people so often distances us from them , and makes them little .
and she said , &quot; well , it is pretty , but , you know , our color , really , it is green . &quot; and -- -- i learned then that listening isn &apos;t just about patience , but that when you &apos;ve lived on charity and dependent your whole life long , it &apos;s really hard to say what you mean .
the first one is called advanced bio-extracts limited .
it &apos;s another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise .
let &apos;s use the market as the best listening device we have , and understand at what price people would pay for this , so they get the dignity of choice .
it takes opening your arms , both , wide , and expecting very little love in return , but demanding accountability , and bringing the accountability to the table as well .
so we came up with a list of requirements , the &quot; 10 commandments , &quot; and they were , in order of ascending difficulty : the first is &quot; no magic . &quot;
it took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction .
so also , put reliable stuff last , the stuff that &apos;s going to run every time .
sorry , start again .
i had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me , but basically to do what ? well , to assess , for example , the state of conservation . see here the face of the madonna of the chair that when just shining a uv light on it you suddenly see another , different lady , aged lady , i should rather say .
and if you want to summarize in one just single word , well , this is what we &apos;re trying to do .
so they &apos;re skin cells that can be tricked , kind of like cellular amnesia , into an embryonic state .
and some of our colleagues at tufts are mixing models like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next , and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies .
there &apos;s no need to see the little detailed words on it .
a tiny airplane , the av pointer serves for surveillance -- in effect , a pair of roving eyeglasses . a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle . it is convenient to carry , assemble and launch by hand . battery-powered , it is silent and rarely noticed .
so matt keenan , just any time you &apos;re -- all right -- ready to let her go . but first , we &apos;re going to make sure that it &apos;s appearing on the screen , so you see what it sees .
pm : if you can pass it down when you &apos;re done . yeah , i think -- i lost a little orientation ; i looked up into this light .
and so where it all goes , i don &apos;t know .
this is my father &apos;s work christmas party , december 1973 .
today we &apos;re going to talk about prime numbers .
but - 1 , - 1 - 1 , are all prime numbers .
he took away one and wrote that number on the board .
in an amazing moment of serendipity , i had to send ted a new slide to show you what this guy had done .
large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips .
give it up for the fundamental particle that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass .
&#91; the &#93; tasmanian devil is found only on the island of tasmania , which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of australia .
they were too young to survive without their mother .
this is jonas .
but if this can happen in tasmanian devils , why hasn &apos;t it happened in other animals or even humans ?
but a small number of them did , and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill -- whose immune systems were probably compromised .
and even divorce lawyers , who should really know better , hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce .
how attractive are you ?
so when they failed it was because they were dumb , and when they succeeded it was because the exam just happened to be really easy .
people with mild depression , they don &apos;t have a bias when they look into the future .
the average likelihood is only 30 percent , &quot; the next time around they would say , &quot; well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent . &quot;
could we alter people &apos;s optimism bias by interfering with the brain activity in these regions ?
we &apos;re not born with an innate understanding of our biases .
now fast forward to 1900 : half the world &apos;s people -- more than half -- still live in asia , but they &apos;re now making only a fifth of the world &apos;s product .
and you can think back to 1941 when the government of japan attacked the united states at pearl harbor .
if you look at history , in recent history , you &apos;ll see the cycles of belief in american decline come and go every 10 or 15 years or so .
doesn &apos;t tell you much about military power , doesn &apos;t tell you very much about soft power .
but also , if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear , it leads to overreaction .
wars persist . power persists .
well , the conventional approach to post-conflict situations has rested on , on kind of , three principles .
and why is it so difficult initially ?
post-conflict economic recovery is a slow process .
it would be ideal to have a standard set of norms where , when we got to a post-conflict situation , there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
on the one hand it pays lip service to the idea of rebuild an effective state in the image of scandinavia in the 1950s .
and so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem .
in 2008 , cyclone nargis and its aftermath killed 138,000 in myanmar .
for example , in galveston , here &apos;s a resilient home that survived hurricane ike , when others on neighboring lots clearly did not .
that &apos;s where half of vietnam &apos;s rice is grown .
it &apos;s up to us to look at our homes and our communities , our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk , and to find ways to not just survive , but to thrive , and it &apos;s up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same , even while they address the underlying causes of climate change .
s : i don &apos;t ever want to let my country down .
t : i want to change my life !
if you score us against their norms , we would have an average i.q. of 130 .
and he said , &quot; of course not .
and let me give you a few illustrations .
compare the banker in 1900 , who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage .
they would not take the hypothetical seriously , and without the hypothetical , it &apos;s very difficult to get moral argument off the ground .
and in 1900 , people could do simple analogies .
james flynn : why our iq levels are higher than our grandparents&apos;
and i &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
so this happened in 1978 , and i was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
you know that teacher ?
and it has four plexiglass layers .
the saboteur is there , and we also read from sun tzu &apos;s &quot; the art of war . &quot;
it &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
she was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
he &apos;s been in many battles .
and we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut-off time -- there was about a minute left -- and despair just settled over the room .
every game we play is different .
many people were inspired by this .
you can just pull this out , this becomes a rectangle .
you just need a ton .
and this is the pump .
there have been six major research papers on this .
we made 30,000 .
this is a touching slate meant for blind children .
and they &apos;d be absolutely joyous playing with this .
so that &apos;s a ship .
if we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does , we could achieve factor 10 , factor 100 , maybe even factor 1,000 savings in resource and energy use .
so with such large , lightweight pillows , we had much less steel .
graham wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this , turning waste streams into schemes that create value .
the way it does this is it comes out at night , crawls to the top of a sand dune , and because it &apos;s got a matte black shell , is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings .
and just to give you some sense of the potential of csp , consider that we receive 10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all forms -- 10,000 times .
and there &apos;s just about every element of the periodic table in seawater .
i turned to my grandmother , who always had plenty of advice , and she said , &quot; stop being so picky .
in fact , in judaism , there were matchmakers a long time ago , and though they didn &apos;t have an explicit algorithm per se , they definitely were running through formulas in their heads , like , is the girl going to like the boy ?
but then steve the i.t. guy didn &apos;t come back .
i wanted somebody was jew ... ish , so i was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture , but wasn &apos;t going to force me to go to shul every friday and saturday .
she listed her job as teacher .
and what i realized was not that i had to dumb down my own profile .
it was enough for a date .
would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra ?
so we &apos;re actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision , and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better .
was it yellow initially or blue ?
different video games have a different effect on your brains .
well , what we do in these training studies is , people come to the lab , they do tasks like this one , we then force them to play 10 hours of action games .
so we normally think of programs as being complicated things that we build for very specific purposes .
it also brings up new issues , though , like computational irreducibility .
let &apos;s say -- i don &apos;t know -- what &apos;s the gdp of spain ?
and , of course , now with wolfram alpha actually out in the wild , we can learn from its actual usage .
so , sometimes , wolfram alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with .
actually , i haven &apos;t shown these before , but here are a few of the candidate universes that i &apos;ve looked at .
the things that people have tried to do in the last 25 years or so with string theory and so on have been an interesting exploration that has tried to get back to the standard model , but hasn &apos;t quite gotten there .
and the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of hiv popping up all over the world , because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-arv carnage of hiv / aids .
these people are tall .
and if my mother ever questioned him , he beat her , abused her , and really it was difficult .
i was the first . there were my sisters and a couple of other girls , and as i approached her , she looked at me , and i sat down .
he got a stroke , and he was really , really sick , so he really couldn &apos;t tell me what to do next .
i learned that it was against the law in kenya .
and i looked at her , i remember that day , and i saw something beyond what i was seeing in angeline .
we &apos;ve questioned the financial industry .
because we binged . we bought extra-large cars , supersized everything , we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome .
it &apos;s been pretty staggering , what we &apos;ve lived through .
the management principle is dollars and cents .
so micropayments have become huge .
the third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living .
so , it &apos;s a consumer driven co-op .
this is all the opportunity about being a community organizer .
it will drive innovation .
and a friend of mine , april , who i &apos;ve had since kindergarten , she thanks her children for doing their chores .
how can we have world peace with different cultures , different languages ?
each time , my grandmother would utter some words in arabic , take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove .
my mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if i &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
everywhere i went , i felt like my imagination was the only suitcase i could take with me .
and this is what i discovered in boston -- that frustration was very stimulating .
we &apos;re all thought to have something very distinctive , if not peculiar .
chekhov said , &quot; the solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things .
there &apos;s a metaphor which i love : living like a drawing compass .
we should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel .
jean ritchie : in nottamun town , not a soul would look out , not a soul would look up , not a soul would look down . bob dylan : come you masters of war , you that build the big guns , you that build the death planes , you that build all the bombs . kirby ferguson : okay , so that &apos;s the same basic melody and overall structure . this next one is &quot; the patriot game , &quot; by dominic behan . alongside that , you &apos;re going to hear &quot; with god on our side , &quot; by dylan .
that &apos;s multi-touch , controlling a device by touching its display .
sj : i mean , picasso had a saying .
kirby ferguson : embrace the remix
third is house number three . it &apos;s easy . it &apos;s obvious . &quot;
it &apos;s about 3.3 billion pounds per year out of 620 billion .
that &apos;s one more picture of enceladus .
because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a solid , immovable , kind of indestructible place , but as a very small , fragile-looking world just hanging against the blackness of space .
and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element .
now that &apos;s an incredible phenomena , because it &apos;s a star that sits there .
it looks like a moon , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of earth .
you could have made it in the 1920s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had penicillin .
in fact , when i know the data that &apos;s being shared and i &apos;m asked explicitly for my consent , i want some sites to understand my habits .
now let me stop here .
this is happening today .
and i could see my father : &quot; yeah , he really is crazy . &quot;
mothers are like that .
you don &apos;t … ?
they saw that i was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
no one was interested in oil spills .
and as i walked off a little bit , they &apos;d say , &quot; yeah , and shut up , too . &quot;
what possessed me to say this thing ?
as our former vice president said , we have to become activists .
i have not seen my mom or my sister since then .
i decided to cross during the day , first because i was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because i knew i was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , i thought i might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
and during dinner , i wanted to have one more wing , but i realized there were not enough for everyone , so i decided against it .
they have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
i just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
we stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
but over two million people cut trees .
it stayed there in taiwan as a permanent church even now .
but look at this . there &apos;s no privacy .
now as you ponder that question , maybe you &apos;re thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten , the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher .
researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples , so that if a baby sucks on one , it hears a recording of its mother &apos;s voice on a pair of headphones , and if it sucks on the other nipple , it hears a recording of a female stranger &apos;s voice .
they &apos;re being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture &apos;s cuisine even before birth .
the &quot; hunger winter , &quot; as it came to be known , killed some 10,000 people and weakened thousands more .
at 8 : 46 a.m. on september 11th , 2001 , there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the world trade center in new york -- commuters spilling off trains , waitresses setting tables for the morning rush , brokers already working the phones on wall street .
they are live and reacting to me in real time .
the tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction .
we think in narrative structures .
tm : thank you .
has anybody stayed there ?
so you walk for another hundred yards , expecting perhaps another sign , that might courteously be yellow , in front of you and saying &quot; trains . &quot;
and you &apos;re pretty rich by the standards of the world at large .
then there are other things that don &apos;t cost much and achieve absolutely nothing .
the excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept .
it &apos;s essentially got a battery , a button and an infrared led , and it turns on -- you guys can &apos;t see it -- but it turns on whenever i push the button .
youtube has really changed the way , or changed the speed , in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world .
and for the first time , i began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people .
and i think the way that we go through that sometimes disembody a group of people , individuals out there in the world .
and over and over again , as i interviewed them and spent my days with them , i did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change .
so this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family , and through that , maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans , that &apos;s this little idea that turned into kiva .
maybe they &apos;re smiling , and they want to talk to you about what they &apos;ve done .
as i &apos;ve researched what &apos;s going on in the united states , a few interesting little insights have come up .
i don &apos;t think we need to be convinced of that . i think we know ; in fact , i think we know so much , and it &apos;s such a reality that we care so deeply , that in fact , what usually stops us is that we &apos;re afraid to try and to mess up , because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other &apos;s lives .
what is the future of the human race ?
i now turn to the second big question : are we alone , or is there other life in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
so trying to cook , answering the phone , writing sms , and maybe uploading some pictures about this awesome barbecue .
so here are pictures of myself .
in fact , those of you who are still conscious and mathematically competent , will note that this is a semi-log plot .
suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company .
because they survived their technology , we could do it too .
it &apos;s hard . there &apos;s no doubt about it .
and he gave some talk . all i remember from it was one word : electronics .
and anyone that &apos;s had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it &apos;s a perfectly positively pitch-black world .
he takes a step back -- so he &apos;s keeping off the other males by splitting his body -- and comes up on the other side ...
just an amazing animal , it can change color and texture to match the surroundings . watch him blend right into this algae .
first entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old .
a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this .
and in the middle is the minister of ethiopian tourism , who came to visit the national museum of ethiopia while i was working there .
and among the answers that you can get from this skeleton are included : first , this skeleton documents , for the first time , how infants looked over three million years ago .
to summarize the significance of this fossil , we can say the following .
so finally , i would like to say , so let &apos;s help africa walk upright and forward , then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
this picture doesn &apos;t exactly show the plastics that i would like it to show , because i haven &apos;t been out there myself .
many species are headed through this region , which is why there &apos;s been so much attention put into conservation of the eastern tropical pacific seascape .
but many of you have said , if you get these marine protected areas , or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place , how are you going to enforce it ?
this is really a two-hour presentation i give to high school students , cut down to three minutes .
and push ! david gallo says , &quot; push yourself .
why do people succeed ? is it because they &apos;re smart ? or are they just lucky ? neither . analyst richard st. john condenses years of interviews into an unmissable 3-minute slideshow on the real secrets of success .
death : death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the organic .
many of us have a social media presence -- a virtual personality made up of status updates , tweets and connections , stored in the cloud . adam ostrow asks a big question : what happens to that personality after you &apos;ve died ? could it ... live on ?
zesty .
and doctors suffer from the god complex a lot .
and what we learned is cesar &apos;s work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine .
we clearly can .
you make lots of money .
i could give you all kinds of facts and figures about the u.s. economy , but i think the most salient one is this : ten percent of american businesses disappear every year .
we &apos;re going to test them out . they &apos;ll probably all fail .
you &apos;re killing people with your clinical trials . you need to shut it down now .
but it was always a conjecture .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s not nice or pleasant or that it &apos;s bad for polar bears or forests , though it certainly is .
china plans to be there in just 20 years .
i &apos;ve done my grieving about the loss .
imagine our highly-tuned , just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying .
think about war .
i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth , more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .
and somehow it will all make sense .
and the problem with this stuff is , now that the bill &apos;s come due , it turns out santa isn &apos;t quite as cute when it &apos;s summertime .
everything else is mandated .
and unless you want this person to not just become the cfo of florida , but the united states , we &apos;d better deal with this stuff .
then they stop growing .
and , of course if you can build mice molars in petri dishes , you can grow human molars in petri dishes .
we also thought we &apos;d have this robot to warn us of danger .
and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can , they &apos;ll be able to hear maybe how bats sing , or how whales talk , or how dogs talk , and other types of tonal scales .
i think we &apos;re going to move from a homo sapiens into a homo evolutis .
and then the child turned two , and i started using the cheap and easy treatment , and i wonder &quot; -- and she wondered , like all parents who lose children wonder -- &quot; if there isn &apos;t something that i could have done , like keep on using that complicated , expensive cure . &quot;
so , many times when you try to do research on data , it records complicated stories -- it &apos;s hard to find in the data .
and i think that &apos;s because they &apos;ve been optimized to pass , as we always expect people to do , to optimize relative to bright-line rules about how affected the car will be .
it &apos;s hard to believe , when you look at this , that that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash .
nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all .
and the jar of pills he had , he said , were the tiniest little pills he could find , so small you could barely see them .
it &apos;s really amazing that all this stuff is here .
and there &apos;s 55 trillion links between all the web pages of the world .
the second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud , and you &apos;re kind of touching the cloud with this .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking forward to . that is where we &apos;re going -- this union , this convergence of the atomic and the digital .
so in the old one , if i wanted to go on to an airline web page , i went from my computer , to an ftp site , to another airline computer .
all this data about you should just be conveyed , and you should do it once and that &apos;s all that should happen .
and what is happening with this is some kind of ai , but it &apos;s not the ai in conscious ai , as being an expert , larry page told me and that &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to do .
you want to make something that the machine can read .
and about 20 years went by .
i was really idealistic .
this technology made a very important impact on us .
so cooking is a very important technology .
take something which looks like food , transform it , and it gives you a good , very easy , accessible energy .
and as i say , energy was necessary .
it senses the food ; it knows exactly what to do .
this we found from bariatric surgery .
heribert watzke : the brain in your gut
all peoples are simply cultural options , different visions of life itself .
it means things happen .
but these localized rituals become pan-andean , and these fantastic festivals , like that of the qoyllur rit &apos;i , which occurs when the pleiades reappear in the winter sky .
values that maintain the proposition that their prayers , and their prayers alone , maintain the cosmic balance .
not simply to the flanks of the mountains , but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims .
and what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the inuit -- a people who don &apos;t fear the cold , but take advantage of it .
in every case , these are dynamic , living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces .
you &apos;ll find it inside of you .
and because they &apos;re made of natural materials , they are 100 percent compostable in you own backyard .
this matrix self-assembles , growing through and around the particles , making millions and millions of tiny fibers .
product designer eben bayer reveals his recipe for a new , fungus-based packaging material that protects fragile stuff like furniture , plasma screens -- and the environment .
a thin film will creep up the inside wall , flow over the top and right out the outside .
but just as quickly as they explode , more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer , so it &apos;s constantly changing just to remain exactly the same .
imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country or bail out an investment bank .
and you &apos;ll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to .
and you can count : one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , 10 -- it happens after the 10th toss .
and you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that .
it &apos;s the same for the first two parts of the sequence .
you know about the human genome project .
it actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is .
and initially , it was thought that they died of what &apos;s known informally as &quot; cot death , &quot; and more formally as &quot; sudden infant death syndrome . &quot;
and to argue , then , that the chance of a second death is as if you didn &apos;t know that information is really silly .
what matters is how likely or unlikely , relative to each other , the two explanations are .
so we need to understand where our competence is and isn &apos;t .
so what about circuit breakers ?
so , to conclude , intelligent power can , globally , save thousands of lives , prevent tens of thousands of injuries , and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage every single year , while significantly reducing global energy consumption .
in the north , there was a great wall , chang cheng .
but on the other hand , they want to keep the server in beijing so they can access the data any time they want .
and also , recently , very funny debate between the beijing environment ministry and the american embassy in beijing because the ministry blamed the american embassy for intervening in chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of beijing .
so these innovations and clones , as the weibo and microblogging , when it came to china in 2009 , it immediately became a media platform itself .
they even name themselves -- you know , use the name of this world-changing battle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab .
so they want an excuse -- public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him .
whatever the future is , we should fight against the &#91; cat &#93; .
music is just one of the strangest things that there is .
i mean literally , they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in .
girl : holly .
now the problems begin first with pitch perception .
you would think that because these implants are optimized for speech , they were designed for speech .
but she jumps to action when called to duty !
i know he doesn &apos;t hear well , because i &apos;ve heard him do karaoke .
it can be pronounced on a computer . it does something like this .
you can look with a microscope and see them on a surface .
rule number three : have a plan .
this is the devils tower in wyoming , which is a columnar basalt formation that most of you probably know from &quot; close encounters . &quot;
bono spoke very eloquently , that we have the tools , for the first time , to address age-old problems of disease and poverty .
we had our best ph.d. students , our most advanced equipment around the world , we got 1 / 10,000th of the project done , so how &apos;re we going to get this done in 15 years ?
printing press took a century to be adopted ; the first computers were designed pen-on-paper -- now we use computers .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we might as well use the third dimension .
but what we &apos;re actually seeing is that we actually more than keep up with it .
it &apos;s now under a 10th of a cent .
there are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices ; there are many experiments in animals .
by 2010 computers will disappear .
if you really look at the power of exponential growth , you &apos;ll see that these things are pretty soon at hand .
essentially , we are pattern-seeking primates .
this is the only equation in the talk by the way .
are more likely to see something in this , which is allegedly patternless .
that is , you decrease the amount of dopamine , and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases .
of course , thanks to the environmentalist movement we &apos;re all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals .
a fairly famous illusion -- it was first done with margaret thatcher .
my favorite one was he was in the manhole .
it ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief .
michael shermer : the pattern behind self-deception
still exists back home .
i mean , here , too , one of our partners was at van jones and the books not bars project -- they have managed , with their footage in california to change the youth correction systems employed , and it &apos;s much -- much -- i think , more humane methods are being looked at , how you should lock up young kids , and that &apos;s questionable to start off .
and it seems appropriate to start at the end , because this is a waste product that comes out of other animals , but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living , and so dung beetles eat dung , and their larvae are also dung-feeders .
what we &apos;re going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position .
and you see him do it again .
and that &apos;s exactly what the beetles are doing here .
the forage has been displaced to a new position .
thank you .
i &apos;m a big fan of stephen hawking , and i wanted to use all eight hours of his cambridge lecture series to create an homage .
that famous scene in horror movies where someone is walking up from behind is something you can see , and i believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audio is turned off or not heard at all , and i speculate that deaf audiences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audiences .
we shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver , and not a gem , nor any coal or iron .
and that , i guess , is probably the finest argument for leaving the house .
that &apos;s the scale . the red line is obviously halfway to the pole .
so in that 18 minutes , or 10 minutes , or five minutes , you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics .
so i don &apos;t want somebody who &apos;s saying , &quot; hey , i &apos;ve got a great idea in a business i know nothing about .
and then finally , you &apos;re asking for my money , not just because it &apos;s my money , but because it &apos;s me .
you want a nice logical progression .
and then finally , anything that &apos;s an error , or a typo , or a stupid mistake , or a line that &apos;s in the wrong place .
what do you do ?
i just want to know -- what the heck is it ?
and i want to know how the money you &apos;re going to get from me is going to help you get there .
so , i couldn &apos;t even see if i wanted to .
and that is how to pitch to a vc .
that took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the earth .
beetles , i was reminded , have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom .
and i really don &apos;t think it &apos;s that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that i &apos;m going to use now to click on the term for &quot; hand , &quot; go to the page for &quot; hand , &quot; where i found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia i &apos;ve found in a long time . it &apos;s simply this : the back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar .
you can finish your game .
there we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
so i think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
heaven forbid they play in the dirt , the kal , or even worse , lokvi , water -- that will kill them .
what a crime . what a crime .
and you know what ?
humans . we play sports .
is it fun ? is it playful ?
we should be celebrating play .
i care that your customer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform bulgaria for the better .
i call myself a maker of things .
that means i had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand .
and i got several answers , and i accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically , i thought , halfway to america .
ez : oh , this summer , in fact , the lomonosov factory was bought by an american company , invited me .
&quot; sputnik &quot; was downtown , the negative . it wasn &apos;t touched .
that &apos;s my father &apos;s letter to me , telling me to marry the woman i first married when i was 20 .
you follow instructions on nerve and you should end up on babble , which we did .
rg : i &apos;m sorry .
and i think i &apos;m speaking obviously here to the father &apos;s experience .
and i called my sister whom i &apos;m very close to -- and had three children -- and i asked her , &quot; why didn &apos;t you tell me i was going to be feeling this way , that i was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated ? &quot;
people i interacted with daily , worked with , was friends with , family members that i had known a long time , had never shared with me their own stories .
so liz mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece , and she interviewed four scientists , and she also interviewed daniel gilbert , and we did indeed find a silver lining .
and if you &apos;re really passionate about what you do every day -- which we are -- and you &apos;re also passionate about your relationship , this is the only way we know how to do it .
and yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .
so i &apos;m going to do this for you right now , what you just heard .
so when you go into the recording session , you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to .
and i believe you &apos;ll get to the next step , the real dream of listeners .
it &apos;s one minute long .
and i spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts .
i have 60,000 of these things in my garden .
and i think that what connects the challenge for civil society , the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now is , in a way , a very simple one , but quite a difficult one .
people come together to sing about the things that really bug them .
then monarchy had seen off its big challenger , mass democracy , which was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment , just as capitalism has seen off socialism .
despite all of these similarities , we see huge differences in savings behavior .
is this difference in languages only between very , very distantly related languages , like english and chinese ?
now while these findings are suggestive , countries can be different in so many different ways that it &apos;s very , very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences .
now effectively everything i &apos;m going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families .
&quot; come to visit the children ?
we were brought to teach english because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education .
so the books are in english , the journals are done in english , but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it brings to mind a headline i saw recently : &quot; education : the great divide . &quot;
so he invented a cost-free solar lamp .
you &apos;re down to a third of the speed , a third of the power , and a good bicyclist can put out that power , and that worked , and we won the prize a year later .
the green line goes down . that &apos;s the wild nature portion .
we focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future , and we produced products for the company .
a they called it their walkalong glider .
this delusion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us .
and he had a lump of iron .
some of it is like gangrenous , and there are maggots in the flesh . and it &apos;s terrible .
but , being human , he &apos;s immediately thinking of his next complaint .
and then , among them , you think of your friends and loved ones , the circle at the table .
and then the next thing we do is what is called &quot; mother recognition . &quot;
every being , even the most mean looking ones , can be motherly .
they &apos;re driven by this duty and this obligation .
and that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us : we are responsible for that , and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it .
but i know it when i see it . &quot;
one answer would be : because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high and they bounce against things rapidly -- that &apos;s a kind of physical science argument .
these are cars and drivers . they dissipate energy .
and if you look at the list of things on the bottom , we are familiar with the arabic numbers one to 10 and so on .
but , in fact , if you have cell phones , you can now go to this nice lady who &apos;s somewhere like namibia , and who is extremely happy with the fact that although she does not have an master &apos;s degree in electrical engineering from mit , she &apos;s nonetheless able to hack her cell phone to get power in some funny way .
cheap , functional , reliable things unleash the creativity of people who then build stuff that you could not imagine .
this is by de saint-exupery .
because traditional economic theory would say , well , the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big r &amp; amp ; d lab where they were thinking up new projects , and it came out of there . it didn &apos;t come from there .
expand the pipeline down to the consumers .
no , what you do , is you go in and you say , &quot; i &apos;ve got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users , and i can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years . &quot;
and it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous .
when i started in journalism -- financial times , 20 years ago -- it was very , very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper .
so it &apos;s not going to be a contest between two camps , but , in between them , you &apos;ll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy .
every morning , there are 600 people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters .
this is the same person -- top photo , james , bottom photo , &#91; jennifer &#93; .
we have to remix it . he &apos;s got a great voice .
but the truth is life is being lived there .
right after september 11th , last year , i was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it , the way that we excise it from our bodies .
but the truth was that as this start becoming popular , a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing , which i could also see .
and i shut that part down .
right now , it feels like i forgot to turn the light on and things that looked so good yesterday are now shades of gray and it seems like the world is spinning while i &apos;m standing still or maybe i am spinning i can &apos;t tell and then you say hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe and now the words sing hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe now everybody sings hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe thank you .
the pattern is that those people , every one of them i looked at , who was a murderer , and was a serial killer , had damage to their orbital cortex , which is right above the eyes , the orbits , and also the interior part of the temporal lobe .
but then my mother said to me , &quot; i hear you &apos;ve been going around talking about psychopathic killers .
but our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here .
and if you see those metal bits there -- those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles , so it can measure how fast they &apos;re traveling .
the quarks , these pink things , are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body .
it &apos;s called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation .
and back in the 1980s , when we wanted the money for the lhc from the u.k. government , margaret thatcher , at the time , said , &quot; if you guys can explain , in language a politician can understand , what the hell it is that you &apos;re doing , you can have the money .
well , they do change in strength .
then light began to travel through the universe .
so i used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet krypton , which was a lot of fun , but didn &apos;t get much result .
you ask , why ?
ron gutman reviews a raft of studies about smiling , and reveals some surprising results . did you know your smile can be a predictor of how long you &apos;ll live -- and that a simple smile has a measurable effect on your overall well-being ? prepare to flex a few facial muscles as you learn more about this evolutionarily contagious behavior .
big noise raised up : &quot; what is this ? what is happening ?
international organizations have invested a lot in albania during these 20 years , not all of it well spent .
i tweet . i love it .
government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
it has been used to help communities prepare for disasters .
you can find out about the latest impromptu music session .
they &apos;re normally backroom or basement hardware service providers , but they need to be elevated to software strategists .
nature had just reminded us that it was stronger than all our technology , and yet here we were , obsessed about being wired .
all of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen .
travel can be liberating , but when it is incessant , we become permanent exiles without repose .
time-warping technology challenges our deepest core , because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget , even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable .
thank you .
this is how english my mother is -- or was , she just passed .
all through that one year , my mother never cried one time , not once .
which sort of made me feel good , because he &apos;d seen a lot of things .
and father mcgetrick was completely unflustered , just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said , &quot; it &apos;s all right daphne , i &apos;m scottish . &quot;
they would knock down the shrine , and they would stop saying the god &apos;s name .
and these things expand and expand and expand into these giant galaxies , and you get trillions of them .
a few more weeks without rain , we would have never seen any of these .
that was partly based on francis galton &apos;s work .
so they go down one side of the mountain , they go down another .
the first place where you would expect to see enormous evolutionary pressure today , both because of the inputs , which are becoming massive , and because of the plasticity of the organ , is the brain .
or maybe it &apos;s chemicals .
so let me give you just a very quick tutorial on how these robots work .
multiple flips , a little more time .
so this robot minimizes snap .
so i want to show you a clip of aphaenogaster desert ants in professor stephen pratt &apos;s lab carrying an object .
as you can see in this figure-eight flight , they come within inches of each other .
so this robot is actually being commanded remotely by frank .
and let me start by telling you , i gotcha .
what &apos;s it gonna look like ? we have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss . we have more and more people , billions of people , in 100 years , god knows how many people , and how little space there will be to fit all of them , so we need to change the way that we see cities , and looking at this picture on the left of new york city today , you can see how gray and brown it is .
perhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in &#91; rural &#93; areas .
and i &apos;m still pricking bees . &quot;
paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping .
i have two loaves of bread here .
but we have , somehow , in the course of the last few centuries , or even decades , started to cultivate an image of a mythical , rural agricultural past .
and this is true , as you can see , for all countries , including the so-called developing countries .
what we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about .
but also we do not want to relegate to poverty in the rural areas .
we &apos;ve moved towards large-scale and very high control .
but we can do a lot more .
he did not speak about rice , in india . he said , &quot; to those who have to go without two meals a day , god can only appear as bread . &quot;
now when you &apos;re talking about trying to travel long distances on rough terrain , i immediately thought of a mountain bike , and a mountain bike &apos;s good at doing this because it has a gear train , and you can shift to a low gear if you have to climb a hill or go through mud or sand and you get a lot of torque but a low speed .
our team made a prototype , brought that prototype to tanzania , kenya and vietnam in 2008 , and found it was terrible because we didn &apos;t get enough input from users .
how do you build a wheelchair ready to blaze through mud and sand , all for under $ 200 ? mit engineer amos winter guides us through the mechanics of an all-terrain wheelchair that &apos;s cheap and easy to build -- for true accessibility -- and gives us some lessons he learned along the road .
and it is a marvelous rain forest .
and king cobras feed only on snakes .
you drink it in peril of your life .
luckily there is still a lot of interest .
but poolan devi was one &#91; of them &#93; . which actually shekhar kapur made an incredible movie , &quot; the bandit queen , &quot; which i urge you to see .
the corporates , the artists , the wildlife nuts , the good old everyday folks can actually bring these rivers back .
and the guy who is working there with them , he &apos;s from maharashtra , he said , &quot; i think he &apos;s after the nusha . &quot;
this is a representative patient who at the time was 73 -- totally needed to have a bypass , decided to do this instead .
the fortuneteller says , &quot; i give smokers a discount because there &apos;s not as much to tell . &quot;
and these things occur within hours . this is a study : a high fat meal , and within one or two hours blood-flow is measurably less -- and you &apos;ve all experienced this at thanksgiving .
you know , i don &apos;t like talking about the atkins diet , but i get asked about it every day , and so i just thought i &apos;d spend a few minutes on that .
while your cholesterol level has remained the same , the research findings have changed . &quot;
and finally , i said , i wonder if there &apos;s any relationship between how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth , whichever group they happened to be in .
and at the end of it , somebody said , &quot; hey , swami , what &apos;s the difference between wellness and illness ? &quot;
girl : you &apos;re different than anybody i &apos;ve ever met .
it happened to be this guy .
and i can remember , actually , when i got the phone call to congratulate us , to say the movie was a go , i actually threw up .
so we aborted using motion capture .
and we also brought in a gentleman named kazu tsuji , and kazu tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time .
we shot him with four hd cameras so we &apos;d get multiple views of him and then david would choose the take of brad being benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast .
skin displacement : another big deal .
and this is footage from a hidden camera in a button .
let &apos;s see if you can get something else . &quot; and we got the bear surrendered to -- we set up a sanctuary . we have four sanctuaries in india .
and the qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past that they &apos;ve lived all their lives .
when i was poet laureate , there i go again -- i can &apos;t help it , it &apos;s true -- i created a poetry channel on delta airlines that lasted for a couple of years .
all afternoon they face one another , the man in the brown suit , the woman in the blue dress -- perfectly motionless , perfectly behaved .
it &apos;s called &quot; the country . &quot;
i just have time to read a more recent poem to you .
and what is interesting about him in relation to morality is that he lived at a time where religion &apos;s influence was waning , and he was sort of wondering , i think , what would happen with society if there was no religion or if there was less religion .
the wolf is , after all , a very cooperative animal .
the second one is that the partner is willing to work even though he &apos;s not interested in the food .
so it &apos;s what we call freeloading .
also , we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion are highly empathic .
one kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses , the other one feeds both of them .
so the final experiment that i want to mention to you is our fairness study .
the other one sees that .
so let &apos;s watch a movement happen , start to finish , in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it .
so first , if you are the type , like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone , remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it &apos;s clearly about the movement , not you .
i &apos;m jewish , but i &apos;m jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian .
i was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year .
and i kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over .
when they wrote the constitution , they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate .
a few years ago , my colleagues and i were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people &apos;s decisions in social situations .
so when this came up in my local shop , naturally i was curious about some of the research backing these claims .
so based on the same logic , i could equally conclude you hate your iphone .
i am more excited than most people , as a neuroscientist , about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness and even maybe to make us better and smarter .
now let &apos;s ask ourselves , what could such artifacts say about us to people 4,000 years into the future ?
now that &apos;s a magnificent piece of art .
which of these hypotheses can be true ?
i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds .
given the computer model , we can test the model by essentially quizzing it .
and both of these are very , very flexible , which is why you find them in the very high range .
and why were they found there ?
and i &apos;d like to give you a quick example of parpola &apos;s work .
what would we find out about them ? about us ?
it &apos;s punctuated by three quick anecdotes , which show how accidental encounters with strange noises gave us some of the most important information we have about space .
so bell employed an engineer to study those noises , to try and find out where they came from , with a view towards building the perfect hardware codec , which would get rid of them so they could think about using radio for the purposes of telephony .
so our story ends at the beginning -- the beginning of all things , the big bang .
with all of us knowing everything , we &apos;re kind of forced by technology to become buddhas or something , to become enlightened .
i need a hundred billion . &quot; so i &apos;m like that .
it should be done by fun . generosity is more fun . that &apos;s the key .
and you realize that this -- being with these people -- is the flower garden that chiho showed us .
he said , &quot; no , i want to abolish the poor . &quot;
150 years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people , children , had the right to education .
one of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well , so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations .
it said &quot; david , age 10 . &quot;
of course , in the challenge there is a prize .
when we did that , here &apos;s a new experiment that we did : we put an animal and had it run -- this grass spider -- on a surface with 99 percent of the contact area removed .
this one disguises itself as floating algae .
when you touched the cockroach leg , what did it feel like ?
dan koditschek put some steel nails -- very simple version -- on the robot , and here &apos;s rhex , now , going over those steel -- those rails . no problem !
did you touch it ?
now you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here .
we took some hairs from a molting gecko ; put three rolls of them on here , and then made this band-aid .
and here &apos;s cutkosky &apos;s and his amazing students &apos; design .
our vision , which works so well in air , all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic .
by contrast , the signature whistle which dolphins use to stay in touch , each individual here has a radically different call .
well , in a place like sarasota , florida , the average interval between times that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group is six minutes .
the top plot here shows a complicated series of calls that are repeated by males .
i &apos;d like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls .
now think about it . this is an amazing thing : that in this frequency range where whales communicate , the main source globally , on our planet , for the noise comes from human ships , thousands of human ships , distant , far away , just all aggregating .
if we also have to wait for silence , they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate .
so it &apos;s very promising , actually .
it &apos;s going to change the way we do astronomy , it &apos;s going to change the way we teach astronomy and i think most importantly it &apos;s going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe .
and thanks to the creators of the worldwide telescope , we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe .
girls outperform boys now at every level , from elementary school to graduate school .
drug addiction , you simply want more .
you know , like that .
this is something that i think is really the way we should be interacting with machines from this point on .
now , this gesture that we &apos;ve developed , again , is just putting two fingers down -- it &apos;s defining an axis of tilt -- and i can tilt up and down that way .
but it &apos;s imperative that we listen because it &apos;s undeniable and definitive .
even of salinas .
many people in mexico are afraid today .
it &apos;s pacific , coordinated civil action , which doesn &apos;t mean passive action .
they just have to raise their hands .
they can take a man &apos;s life .
and , we &apos;re just about to announce the zinio reader product that i believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read .
but if you push the button , of course , the whole wall goes dark .
though they work in a wide-open office space spectacularly set under san francisco &apos;s oakland bay bridge , the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems .
and it &apos;s a company that &apos;s trying to bring the experience -- many people have boats , or enjoy being on boats , but a very small percentage of people actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing what &apos;s there , and enjoying what scuba divers do .
so we &apos;re in the process of helping them design deep-well , low-cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off-season .
in fact , if you look really closely at stuff , if you look at the basic substructure of matter , there isn &apos;t anything there .
that &apos;s what he thought he was there for .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . do you know that ?
okay . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and he said , &quot; well , i &apos;ve no idea .
ladies and gentlemen , a picture is not worth a thousand words .
and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that &apos;s not the highest quality data .
well which one should i use ?
but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 .
for instance , here &apos;s the trajectory of marc chagall , an artist born in 1887 .
el so culturomics is what we call this method .
this person studies all the &quot; arghs , &quot; from one through eight a &apos;s .
if i left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes , you would literally cease to hear it .
many people take refuge in headphones , but they turn big , public spaces like this , shared soundscapes , into millions of tiny , little personal sound bubbles .
you can do it in a beautiful place as well , like in a lake .
you can use this in listening , in communication .
and their eyes would say , &quot; nobody ever sees me . thank you . &quot;
my crew once pulled our van up to a really poor miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an 18-year-old girl , still living at home , and her family were all undocumented immigrants from honduras .
and our music is a cross between punk and cabaret .
they don &apos;t want to ask for things .
and i think when we really see each other , we want to help each other .
this one was from haiti .
juarez : you &apos;ve heard of the border -- one of the most dangerous borders in the world .
maybe not in one year . that &apos;s the beginning .
in september 1979 , scientific american came out with a single topic issue about the brain . and it was quite good .
so what i did is i went back in the computer industry and said , well , i &apos;ll have to work here for a while , do something .
this works in physics . this works in geology . but if this is normal science , what does neuroscience look like ? this is what neuroscience looks like .
some people say , brains can &apos;t understand brains .
this is lunacy . we all know the earth isn &apos;t moving .
and the alligator has some very sophisticated senses .
and if you &apos;re a rat and you go through a maze , and then you learn the maze , the next time you &apos;re in a maze , you have the same behavior , but all of a sudden , you &apos;re smarter because you say , oh , i recognize this maze , i know which way to go , i &apos;ve been here before , i can envision the future . and that &apos;s what it &apos;s doing .
now , when your eye moves from eye to eye , if there was something else there like , a nose , you &apos;d see a nose where an eye is supposed to be , and you &apos;d go , oh shit , you know -- there &apos;s something wrong about this person .
it &apos;s also memory of sequences .
i don &apos;t know how this is going to turn out .
we need to redefine what makes us secure in this world .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s good . that &apos;s good .
we need to be able to talk to you out there , so that you can give the message of what &apos;s happening here . &quot;
this is rigoberta menchu tum .
and now she was going to watch electricity do that work .
or , to be more precise , how do most of the women in the world wash ?
and it &apos;s 12 units used in the entire world , and the richest one billion , they use six of them .
because the risk , the high probability of climate change is real .
and she also got books for herself .
in the same span of time , computers &apos; ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude .
we included in this information some references to some funny , absolutely legal , but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online .
one of these mechanisms is transparency , telling people what you are going to do with their data .
we can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient , not even the nsa .
so i do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information , the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom , rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us .
but the paradox is , when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode , that social awareness vanishes and they start talking like accountants .
and you can usually tell the uber-moms because they actually weigh less than their own children .
and when you synthesize it all , it &apos;s giving us a new view of human nature .
it tells us what to imprint .
babies are born to interpenetrate into mom &apos;s mind and to download what they find -- their models of how to understand reality .
the third trait is metis , what we might call street smarts -- it &apos;s a greek word .
when their kids were five and two , carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly .
but the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body .
you have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked .
it &apos;s in that context that i work .
i can &apos;t hear from my right ear .
can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem ?
the dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite , out of a lump of rock . it &apos;s made up of lots of little bits .
the only thing that queen victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the f-word , which has happened in american dictionaries since 1965 .
online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen .
so , if you have a ham butt problem , and you &apos;re thinking about the ham butt problem , the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive : paper is the enemy of words .
if you love a word , use it . that makes it real .
so , we have all these words , and we really need help !
but he found 140 comets without a telescope .
we can put in all the meanings .
and 15 years later , there are 100 of them and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times .
it &apos;s connected ; it all hooks into each other .
jeff bezos kindly remarked to me , &quot; chris , ted is a really great conference .
chris anderson gave this talk in 2002 , prior to taking over leadership of ted . founder richard saul wurman was leaving , and ted &apos;s future was in the balance . he seeks to persuade tedsters that what was then a for-profit conference had a secure future as an idea-based nonprofit endeavor .
she couldn &apos;t put up with his persistent anger .
in one study , we showed people a simulated accident and we asked people , how fast were the cars going when they hit each other ?
you were ultimately rescued by an elderly person and reunited with the family .
and so what these studies are showing is that you can plant false memories and they have repercussions well , along with this ability to plant memories and control behavior obviously come some important ethical issues , like , when should we use this mind technology ?
the change was silent , imperceptible , unless you knew exactly what to look for .
well , these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago , but things have changed .
&quot; okay , what about the fbi ? &quot;
our modern society has a special relationship with gps .
people figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one .
we simply cannot tolerate gps jammers and spoofers , and yet , given the lack of effective legal means for protecting our privacy from the gps dot , can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on , for wanting to use them ?
but the problem is that , when i left home and went to college , i started missing his commands .
so each pygmy has its own behavior , psyche , mood swings , personalities and so on .
and it &apos;s kind of constrained by that circle .
and once a creature pops into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
we are moving to cities . we are moving up in the world .
likewise , with solar , especially here in california , we &apos;re discovering that the 80 solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze 1,000 square miles of southern california desert .
so arguing against , a man who &apos;s been at the nitty , gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years .
so the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind , or something else .
that &apos;s the footprint that is always being confused .
there &apos;s five to 10 times more wind available worldwide than we need for all the world .
there &apos;s plenty of solar and wind .
if we build all these nuclear power plants , all that waste is going to be on hundreds , if not thousands , of trucks and trains , moving through this country every day .
i will also add one other thing .
fifteen percent of the entire u.s .
the first walks around the badly injured toddler completely .
the heart , of course , you felt .
and yes , toby is married and he does have a mortgage .
but if you want to look for effective charities , this is a good website to go to .
it &apos;s from a man named chris croy , who i &apos;d never heard of .
i propose we look to nature .
and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce .
there &apos;s too many surfaces , there &apos;s too much detail , one can &apos;t see the end state .
so where does this leave us ?
you would think this wouldn &apos;t be too hard , that we would simply have the ability to take this fundamental information that we &apos;re learning about how it is that basic biology teaches us about the causes of disease and build a bridge across this yawning gap between what we &apos;ve learned about basic science and its application , a bridge that would look maybe something like this , to get from one side to the other .
that &apos;s danny bessette , 23 years later , because this is the year , and it &apos;s also the year where danny got married , where we have , for the first time , the approval by the fda of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis based upon all this molecular understanding .
so sam , why don &apos;t you tell these folks what it &apos;s like being affected with this condition called progeria ?
it was developed for cancer . it was azt .
this is research that &apos;s high-risk , sometimes high-cost .
not that you do ; i &apos;m just saying .
i myself am personalizing these cultural developments , but i also understand that this has to be done organically .
in the same way , qatar is trying to grow its national museums through an organic process from within .
who are you playing ?
i welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions .
and then i saw her legs .
and from there i was watching this little world .
so i decided to slice these up with the tool that i make by -- i sharpen the end of a needle into a blade .
and i decided to build it up .
because it &apos;s on this molecular level things change and they act different .
it could end up looking like humpty dumpty or somebody else .
and i cut off a little flake of gold .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s amazing now , because he &apos;s so much bigger than me , but when derek was born , he could have fitted on the palm of your hand .
and as you can see from the picture , there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing , derek .
and it &apos;s that ability , that ability to hear simultaneous sounds , not only just single sounds , but when a whole orchestra is playing , derek , you can hear every note , and instantly , through all those hours and hours of practice , reproduce those on the keyboard , that makes you , i think , is the basis of all your ability .
so just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish .
dp : for one encore . ao : one encore , yes .
it is not a fork designed to grab three hors d &apos;oeuvres at a time , which would be useful out in the lobby , i would say .
it is easy to forget the gasp-inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life .
and so , coming directly from there to here .
if she has a bad run , and her score isn &apos;t good , she &apos;ll come and reach up and tap on the glass -- because she can &apos;t see the experimenter -- which is asking to have another go .
we find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich -- they have a lot of sounds , which they use in different circumstances , but they also use touch , posture , gesture , and what do they do ?
they &apos;re given weapons ; they shoot for the logging camps ; they get money .
and yet , there are hundreds and hundreds of children in the developed world who never see nature , because they &apos;re growing up in concrete and all they know is virtual reality , with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun , or in the forest , with the dappled sun-specks coming down from the canopy above .
and these are projects to make the world around them a better place .
the philosophy is very simple .
and we &apos;ve talked a lot about that .
we &apos;ll just take one example here : a virus is a natural system , right ?
these membranes are also quite similar , morphologically and functionally , to the membranes in your body , and we can use these , as they say , to form the body of our protocell .
we take this same moving protocell here , and we put it in another experiment , get it moving . then i &apos;m going to add some food to the system , and you &apos;ll see that in blue here , right ?
but then something even more interesting happens .
so , doing these artificial life experiments helps us define a potential path between non-living and living systems .
but that suggests the issue that i &apos;m trying to get at here , that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health .
and so next time your neighbor sees you they &apos;ll say , &quot; how is that tadpole doing ? &quot;
vodka , gin -- yes . yes . you know your mice well .
it &apos;s also increasing fixing co2s , sequestering some of the airborne pollutants .
that actually removes about 95 percent of the carbon black , that stuff that , with ozone , is responsible for about half of global warming &apos;s effects , because it changes , it settles on the snow , it changes the reflectors , it changes the transmission qualities of the atmosphere .
so there was several of these .
but perhaps the most popular has been that we &apos;ve got another array of these boys in the bronx river , where the first beaver -- crazy as he is -- to have moved in and built a lodge in new york so updates from a beaver .
prince wrote a great song : &quot; little red corvette . &quot;
and sequel truly is a real car .
so since we can &apos;t predict the future , we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future .
we can &apos;t grow our business unless we solve these problems .
i took a school bus to the fancy side of town .
so he knew that i was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance , but we were going to push forward and keep moving on .
teaching elements of persuasion , it doesn &apos;t get any more real than that .
brazil was starting to urbanize , industrialize , and i knew the politics . i became a little bit radical , i was a member of leftist parties , and i became an activist .
he made a long examination , and told me , &quot; sebastian , you are not sick , your prostate is perfect .
we created an institution called instituto terra , and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere .
that is the essence of our life , these forests .
and i &apos;ll show you the last picture .
landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals .
and if i zoom in to lower manhattan you can see the extent of new york city as it was , right at the end of the american revolution .
then , if we added maps like the geology , the bedrock geology , and the surface geology , what the glaciers leave , if we make the soil map , with the 17 soil classes , that are defined by the national conservation service , if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were , then we can calculate the slopes .
so , we would read in field guides , the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves , you know , what beavers need is &quot; a slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows , near the water . &quot; that &apos;s the best thing for a beaver .
we call these muir webs after the scottish-american naturalist john muir , who said , &quot; when we try to pick out anything by itself , we find that it &apos;s bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken , to everything in the universe . &quot;
and we can see this in the geography of the city today .
this is a crowd that does know what it is , so i &apos;ll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version . right ?
it &apos;s going to be a pretty crowded place , at least eight billion people .
so , first of all , what are we looking for ? bright green city .
when you share them , you end up using less .
it &apos;s every seven days .
i particularly like the little linux penguin in the back .
so lula , he &apos;s full of problems , full of contradictions , but one of the things that he &apos;s doing is , he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration .
here &apos;s a design for harvesting rainwater that &apos;s super cheap and available to people in the developing world .
and as they grow up , they will grow up around the mines , their roots will detect the chemicals in them , and where the flowers turn red you don &apos;t step .
if you want a printed sugar birthday cake , you have to use one of our prefab images -- only for professionals . &quot;
because it turned out we &apos;re not really couch potatoes .
bits are copyable . that &apos;s what computers do .
imagine it says ted , because the comments can &apos;t be policed at any acceptable cost .
pipa and sopa are not oddities , they &apos;re not anomalies , they &apos;re not events .
you can see in 1926 the first pacemaker was invented .
they basically stuck an attacker on the wired network and on the wireless network .
you remotely unlock the doors through the computer that controls that , start the engine , bypass anti-theft , and you &apos;ve got yourself a car .
if they found encrypted communication , they stayed that these people communicate in , these law enforcement agencies , and they went to 20 metropolitan areas and listened in on conversations that were happening at those frequencies .
if someone is able to put malware on your iphone , they could then maybe get the typing that you do whenever you put your iphone next to your keyboard .
i said , &quot; no , i &apos;ve got the best eduction .
what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college . &quot;
you come for the work and the challenge , you &apos;ll come to the barefoot college .
and i said , &quot; okay , i &apos;ll go to the old man in village and say , &apos; what should i grow in this spot ? &apos; &quot; he looked quietly at me and said , &quot; you build this , you build this , you put this , and it &apos;ll work . &quot;
she actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children .
she &apos;s only 12 years old , and she &apos;s not dazzled by anything . &quot;
television ? no .
we went to africa , and we did the same thing .
i said , &quot; i like the body language . i like the way she speaks . &quot;
bunker roy : learning from a barefoot movement
higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain .
in a minute we &apos;re going to move to a two-orbital configuration , and you &apos;re going to notice a pulsing .
well , it turns out the pre-frontal cortex does lots of things , but one of the most important things it does is it is an experience simulator .
in fact , a recent study -- this almost floors me -- a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago , with only a few exceptions , it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness .
what does he have to say all these years later about it ?
second : spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can .
&quot; tell us how much you like them now . &quot;
&quot; sorry , doc , i just don &apos;t have a clue . &quot;
&quot; my printer prints a blank page after every document . &quot;
you get to keep one , and i get to keep one . &quot;
duh ! 66 percent of the students , two-thirds , prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind .
my son designed a rocket that became stable , a golf ball rocket -- i thought it was quite an interesting experiment in the principles of rocket science -- and it flies straight as an arrow .
voices : it &apos;s going ballistic . oh shit .
i said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to talk to a bunch of nice people . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to tell you a little story .
it &apos;s delicious . it &apos;s savory .
i show up . she &apos;s in the carport .
&quot; are you kidding me ? &quot;
&quot; would this guy have , like , a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face ? &quot;
now , see , this is the kind of machiavellian thinking , that you really have to -- you know , in my mind , it &apos;s a rabbit &apos;s warren , this woman &apos;s mind .
see , we &apos;re a secret club with a secret handshake .
but it isn &apos;t like i haven &apos;t seen this crime scene before .
and she &apos;s bringing me in with a slight salsa movement .
it &apos;s a beautiful hierarchy , and it works .
what are catastrophic effects ? a three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in 50 percent species extinction .
so , how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles ?
it &apos;s when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads .
you guys are going to be the handsome young guy and i &apos;m going to be the wise businessman .
how do we create a big network ?
and this open-source version means that it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it -- it could be used around the world very quickly .
life was pretty good .
very sadly , he took his own life .
and i &apos;ve summarized those things , for me personally , as three as .
they &apos;re in there .
you go places you &apos;ve dreamt about .
they &apos;ve got an apple here from south africa .
you can smell bakery air , walk around with rain hair , pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap .
so my baby , vander , is eight years old now .
how do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion ?
let me tell you what i &apos;ve come up with .
how old it is ?
no wonder people are averse to doodling at work .
there are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions .
they also had taken out numerous patents on essential parts of the airplane .
people who have access to these drugs stop dying .
they pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders , so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property .
we are in this wonderful open-air amphitheater and we are enjoying ourselves in that mild evening temperature tonight , but when qatar will host the football world cup 10 years from now , 2022 , we already heard it will be in the hot , very hot and sunny summer months of june and july .
which is the driving parameter which gives me a perceived temperature ? and these parameters , these climatic parameters are related to the human metabolism .
we don &apos;t borrow any energy from history .
it &apos;s about the fastest and the most efficient and the most dazzling gadget you can have , while about two-thirds of the world can hardly reach the most basic of this technology to even address fundamental needs in life , including health care , education so before i start , i want to talk about a little anecdote , a little story about a man i met once in mumbai .
so , we kind of toyed around with this idea , and we said , &quot; what can we do with this ?
luminosity was an issue , when you have too much bright sunlight outside .
so ...
and i was observing what happened to people and their families over the course of their terminal illness .
and , along with my collaborator , james fowler , we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic and could it spread from person to person like the four people i discussed earlier .
and here , the idea is not that my weight gain is causing your weight gain , nor that i preferentially form a tie with you because you and i share the same body size , but rather that we share a common exposure to something , like a health club that makes us both lose weight at the same time .
and , by the end , you &apos;re going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network .
the question that we wanted to ask was : could emotion spread , in a more sustained way than riots , across time and involve large numbers of people , not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car ?
that &apos;s very obvious , we all know that .
so whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge is also partially heritable .
i think , in fact , that if we realized how valuable social networks are , we &apos;d spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them , because i think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness .
but the more we learn about aging , the clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course is grossly inaccurate .
now you see this slight downturn at very advanced ages .
and if there &apos;s a paradox of aging , it &apos;s that recognizing that we won &apos;t live forever changes our perspective on life in positive ways .
this will not be a speech like any one i have ever given .
a sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun , puts it to my head , and says , &quot; tell me where your father is or i will kill you . &quot;
greece , yes , triggered the euro crisis , and some people blame me for pulling the trigger .
my european counterparts , some of them , at least , said , &quot; you can &apos;t do this .
today we have globalized the markets but we have not globalized our democratic institutions .
thank you .
during that movie i got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers -- amazing , the best in the world -- and they brought me into a society , the sort of underground street culture that blew my mind .
we got madd chadd , lil &apos; c , kid david and j smooth .
many of you may have heard of the lakota , or at least the larger group of tribes called the sioux .
10 years later , the homestead act , signed by president lincoln , unleashed a flood of white settlers into native lands .
custer recommends that congress find a way to end the treaties with the lakota as soon as possible .
more medals of honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in world war one , world war two , korea , vietnam , iraq or afghanistan .
the housing office is unable to build new structures , and existing structures are falling apart .
and how much of this history do you need to own , even ?
now , we &apos;ve known for a long time the cause of diarrhea .
maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration alone doesn &apos;t solve . that &apos;s not true either .
intercropping . intercropping really increases income .
in india , 35 to 50 percent say &quot; reduce . &quot;
this is easy , $ 1.10 .
i suspect most of you -- i hope that &apos;s true for the rest of you -- actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world .
which one of these people has done more for the environment ?
now , this is an example of that battle , and makes us realize intentions don &apos;t always translate into action , and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that . ok ?
here &apos;s another example of this .
we &apos;re on the verge of a whole new social science .
alright sendhil , thanks so much for coming to ted . thank you .
but if any of you have studied electrical engineering , we can also create a short circuit .
so i would encourage you all to grab some play-doh , grab some salt , grab some sugar and start playing .
it said , &quot; money does does make me happy . &quot;
if you do this , the common , the logic says you must turn the wrist .
and i will give my tribute to water .
so these guys have actually a stronger hand -- three aces and two kings .
lg : here -- you see some are missing ?
no , now and then i put in a mistake , just to emphasize how difficult it is .
please name any card , anyone .
lg : pardon ?
yeah .
you see , i don &apos;t work with prestige , so always do mistakes .
lg : ok , now .
and it was ok . one more ?
okay .
jack of diamonds , correct ?
one is i want to remind you of what a seven-year-old child sounds like when he plays the piano .
and i was working with this young pianist and i said , &quot; the trouble with you is you &apos;re a two-buttock player .
and then there &apos;s a very small group .
but has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy in classical music is not because of you , but because of us ?
now , he gets excited . that &apos;s excitement , you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
so now , you &apos;re going to follow the line all the way from b to e .
if you thought , three percent of the population likes classical music , if only we could move it to four percent . how would you walk ?
for me , it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s not about wealth and fame and power .
i never practiced law a day in my life ; i pretty much wasn &apos;t allowed to .
here &apos;s what he did . he gathered his participants .
this is one of the most robust findings in social science , and also one of the most ignored .
that routine , rule-based , left-brain work -- certain kinds of accounting , certain kinds of financial analysis , certain kinds of computer programming -- has become fairly easy to outsource , fairly easy to automate .
okay ? if you do really well you get the large reward , on down .
and if we really want to get out of this economic mess , and if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century , the solution is not to do more of the wrong things , to entice people with a sweeter carrot , or threaten them with a sharper stick .
it looks like less than half .
autonomy , mastery and purpose , these are the building blocks of a new way of doing things .
the drive to do things cause they matter .
so this is just floating , floating on a permanent magnetic field , which stabilizes it in all directions .
and then the moon in the center , and it &apos;s floating . and this is in france .
it has buckminster fuller &apos;s dymaxion map edited here .
so it can see its environment , and then it can mimic its environment and disappear .
tom shannon shows off his gravity-defying , otherworldly sculpture -- made of simple , earthly materials -- that floats and spins like planets on magnets and suspension wire . it &apos;s science-inspired art at its most heavenly .
we have two rulebooks .
but they have to be asked .
they were taught that self-interest was a raging sea that was a sure path to eternal damnation .
our sponsor went and tried the events on their own .
dan pallotta : the way we think about charity is dead wrong
they don &apos;t often even look at the conductor .
people who build this wonderful concert hall .
so , does it work ? yes , it works -- to a certain point .
but how does it happen ? did you see him turning pages in the score ?
&quot; do you understand what this guy wants ? &quot;
that is another story .
go along with the video . look .
so again , the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work , and creative and all of that .
now , if you are doing all the things we talked about , together , and maybe some others , you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing .
and it &apos;s increasingly clear that we aren &apos;t going to be able to rely on the fact that we &apos;re going to have this at our disposal forever .
we had stories like &quot; the seven-league boots &quot; : the giant who had these boots , where , once you put them on , with every stride you could cover seven leagues , or 21 miles , a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal .
but we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands .
when our supermarkets have only two or three days &apos; worth of food in them at any one time , often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in .
some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects , like community-supported agriculture schemes , urban food production , creating local food directories , and so on .
i think i &apos;d like to just return at the end to the idea of stories .
here &apos;s the overall picture .
but even so , as you go out into those future years , various pension costs , health costs go up enough , and the revenue does not go up enough .
the forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from 26 percent of the budget to 42 percent .
well there really is no brain trust .
in fact , there are some like these : erskine bowles , alan simpson and others , who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem .
when i was 17 , i visited dr. schlaug &apos;s lab , and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain -- how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians , how music , and listening to music , could just light up the entire brain , from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum , how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism , to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression , how deeply parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music , and how late-stage alzheimer &apos;s patients , whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family , could still pick out a tune by chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children .
after one of our events at the patton state hospital in san bernardino , a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face , and she had a palsy , she was shaking , and she had this gorgeous smile , and she said that she had never heard classical music before , she didn &apos;t think she was going to like it , she had never heard a violin before , but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine , and that nobody ever came to visit them , and that for the first time in six years , when she heard us play , she stopped shaking without medication .
however , here &apos;s chris &apos; clock .
now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
this is an iron , you know , for your clothes , to which i added a spraying mechanism , so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent , and your clothes will smell nicer , but hopefully it should also make the ironing experience more enjoyable .
don &apos;t they just pop into your head ?
&quot; hurray ! my boy finally started to lie ! &quot;
kids do art .
but kids , usually they do art for fun . it &apos;s playing .
but such a teacher is seldom found .
in karaoke bars , there are always people who sing &quot; she &apos;s gone &quot; or &quot; hotel california , &quot; miming the guitar riffs .
likewise , stage art majors may become actors , and in this way you put on a show .
most artists became artists because of the one reason .
someone is a golfer by day and writer by night .
the right answer , confirmed by the soviet venera spacecraft , was that venus was very hot -- 900 degrees fahrenheit .
but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels .
the total energy imbalance now is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter .
the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today .
so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe texas and moscow heatwaves were not natural ; they were caused by global warming .
if we start next year , it is six percent per year .
what safety they had was very scant .
i could , quite literally , fire myself into the gallery .
you should hear some of the phone conversations that i have with people on my bluetooth in the shop .
this is a shot of &quot; terminator , &quot; the movie .
so that &apos;s the balloon , big gas balloon .
not even a jet engine .
now you may think this is just a thrill-seeking trip , a pleasure ride , just the world &apos;s biggest stunt .
it &apos;s a two-layer suit . nasa suits have got 13 layers .
but if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
we considered this to be one of the lead parts .
&quot; must try harder . &quot; being sent to bed by his dad , you know , to shakespeare , &quot; go to bed , now , &quot; to william shakespeare , &quot; and put the pencil down .
if you were to visit education , as an alien , and say &quot; what &apos;s it for , public education ? &quot;
and i think we can &apos;t afford to go on that way .
i saw a great t-shirt really recently which said , &quot; if a man speaks his mind in a forest , and no woman hears him , is he still wrong ? &quot;
and he &apos;s right .
i moved to dubai as the head of original content for a western tv network .
and one more thing : no , don &apos;t f it up . &quot;
20 years ago , no one had heard of it .
for inspiration , go to one of our festivals , go online , drop us a line .
what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is .
what i &apos;ve been talking to you about so far is mental disorders , that &apos;s actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days , and people feel that , for whatever reason , it &apos;s politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior .
the good-news stories in medicine are early detection , early intervention .
we played with the children , and came back home really tired , exhausted , but with images of bright faces , twinkling eyes , and went to sleep .
our dream is very simple : to send each of these kids , get them prepared to be educated but also to live peacefully , contented in this conflict-ridden chaotic globalized world .
there is also this myth that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school ; they &apos;d much rather put them to work .
vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school .
last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school .
now , &quot; horsing &quot; is going for a horse ride .
and one of his first clients was -- this is many years ago , back in the early &apos; 70s -- one of his first clients was pepsi .
they were looking for the perfect pepsi , and they should have been looking for the perfect pepsis . trust me .
so they came to howard , and they said , fix us .
and that &apos;s when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar , and 14 different kinds of mustard , and 71 different kinds of olive oil -- and then eventually even ragu hired howard , and howard did the exact same thing for ragu that he did for prego .
number two thing that howard did is he made us realize -- it &apos;s another very critical point -- he made us realize in the importance of what he likes to call &quot; horizontal segmentation . &quot;
there are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people .
they were looking for one way to treat all of us .
they told his parents that they predicted that he was going to be a star .
strike one is when you hit puberty .
patients come to them , they want to do something . we &apos;re americans , we can &apos;t just stand there , we have to do something . and so they want a drug .
well , he &apos;s right , but he didn &apos;t say to me , well , you have pre-obesity or you have pre-diabetes , or anything like that . he didn &apos;t say , better start taking this statin , you need to lower your cholesterol .
now , faith in things which cannot be seen , which cannot be proved , i tend to like science , where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know .
well , i started making comics , but i also started trying to understand them , almost immediately .
there were hypertext comics .
but media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in .
anyway , as i plunged through my 20s ever more aware of how unobtainable the first part of my childhood ambition was , it was that second part , being able to successfully communicate to others whatever knowledge i was gaining , where the futility of my quest really set in .
now it &apos;s not often that i &apos;m going to associate the words honesty and integrity with limbaugh , but it &apos;s really hard to argue with that punchline .
if you have a baby and you think that baby &apos;s gay , you should be allowed to put it up for adoption .
and joel was explaining to me that , because usa today was one of america &apos;s four papers of record , it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference , which meant that , if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon on monday , the opening day of the conference , it could get passed around at the highest level among actual decision-makers .
now , i &apos;ve got a story for you .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that all , or many , or most of today &apos;s attested languages couldn &apos;t descend perhaps from one that &apos;s much younger than that , like say 20,000 years , or something of that kind . it &apos;s what we call a bottleneck .
you know , you look at sharks , and they &apos;re streamlined , and they &apos;re sleek , and you look at tuna , and they &apos;re like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda . they &apos;re about migration and strength , and then you look at the sunfish .
if we &apos;re going to save the world from total jellyfish domination , then we &apos;ve got to figure out what the jellyfish predators -- how they live their lives , like the mola .
we &apos;d love to tag in monterey .
and you &apos;re just wondering , oh , i hope the fish is safe , i hope , i hope it &apos;s going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording .
which brings me to my last point , and what i think is kind of the most fun .
and from that , the on-board micro-controllers can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations .
nick sears : demo : the orb
the one-eyed monkey recognized the woman , a sekhri .
that &apos;s a lot of women who don &apos;t get justice .
it was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural gujarat , because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws &apos; families .
because there is no profit in it .
so this is the cotton sari .
adrenaline , kill . it &apos;ll give you the will .
we need to break down our vision of what planners are , of what the correct way of a path is .
i have an idea . i am going to go to each of these young men if they defeated correctly .
and it was von neumann who said , after the bomb , he was working on something much more important than bombs : he &apos;s thinking about computers .
if you look at the origins of this , the classic history sort of takes it all back to the eniac here .
this is hackers getting in trouble for the first time .
this includes a large amount of human error .
so they really were working under tough conditions .
so von neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos from all over the world to work on all these problems .
they have to go out and do something . and he started doing that , started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with -- playing chess with other machines and so on .
my laptop is 10 thousand million times the size of the universe that they lived in when barricelli quit the project .
we have an awful , awful reality right now .
we need a revolution .
she &apos;s the third generation of americans that hasn &apos;t grown up within a food environment where they &apos;ve been taught to cook at home or in school , or her mom , or her mom &apos;s mom .
can &apos;t even get them out the door -- and i &apos;m being serious -- can &apos;t even get them there . forklift .
that ain &apos;t happening anymore .
the lunch ladies , the lunch cooks of america -- i offer myself as their ambassador .
do you know what that is ? broccoli ?
okay ? there &apos;s sugar in everything .
love them . they just sell us what we want . all right .
you know , it &apos;s now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff .
there is plenty of beautiful things going on . there are angels around america doing great things in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups , garden set-ups , education -- there are amazing people doing this already .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in 2011 .
the web links everything , and very soon it will mediate most human activity .
now , so far i &apos;ve mentioned the hackers anonymous who are a politically motivated hacking group .
and he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on sprees in new york , taking out $ 10,000 from an atm here , $ 30,000 from an atm there , using cloned credit cards .
his slide into criminality was incremental .
now i discussed this with professor simon baron-cohen who &apos;s the professor of developmental psychopathology at cambridge .
and in the process , what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges .
but is it practical ?
it &apos;s now home to artist studios , theater groups , dance troupes .
this is another infill project on the parking lots , this one of an office park outside of washington d.c .
that &apos;s really history .
but perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology , as in this example outside of minneapolis .
and so we &apos;ve created the eco-acre transfer-to-transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re-greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production .
there is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them .
in great neck , new york , they call it a &quot; pussy-cat . &quot;
but this wave started , and if i question the wave , or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave , i often have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck breaking . but if i go with the wave , and i trust the wave and i move with the wave , i go to the next place , and it happens logically and organically and truthfully .
it has taken me to universities all over this country where girls are date-raped and drugged .
she was 21 years old . i went to guatemala and she had sold out the national theater of guatemala .
and always as a child i had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me .
so , how do i explain this mysterious affinity ?
mr. teszler went down to the plant and confronted the thief and said , &quot; but why do you steal from me ? if you need money you have only to ask . &quot;
now , you should know that at that time , the textile industry in the south was notoriously segregated .
as the medieval knight antonius block returns from the wild goose chase of the crusades and arrives on the rocky shore of sweden , only to find the specter of death waiting for him , mr. teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students . and as death opened his cloak to embrace the knight in a ghastly embrace , i heard mr. teszler &apos;s tremulous voice : &quot; uh oh , &quot; he said , &quot; this doesn &apos;t look so good . &quot;
now , i know absolutely nothing about mayan ceramics , but i wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so i said , &quot; but dr. robicsek , this is absolutely dazzling . &quot;
this is our task ; we know it will be hard .
tapestries were ubiquitous between the middle ages and , really , well into the 18th century , and it was pretty apparent why .
by the end of the show , we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show , but no one really complained .
wow . she is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality .
would you explain the rules for admission ?
pm : you &apos;re running a medical clinic .
so it was the need and the people we saw in the early &apos; 90s -- that &apos;s what made us go back and work for them .
hawa abdi + deqo mohamed : mother and daughter doctor-heroes
it is not a map .
the mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball .
we understood mountains under compression , but we could not understand why we had a mountain under tension .
we stumbled on it , looking for some missing heat .
you &apos;re looking at brine pools formed by salt diapirs .
fortunately , we &apos;ve been able to convince congress .
they can follow this expedition . i &apos;ve started a program -- where are you jim ? jim young who helped me start a program called the jason project . more recently , we &apos;ve started a program with the boys and girls clubs of america , so that we can use exploration , and the excitement of live exploration , to motivate them and excite them and then give them what they &apos;re already ready for .
in my childhood , i played around in my father &apos;s university lab .
when andrew taught the machine learning class to the general public , it had 100,000 people registered .
or jenny , who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master &apos;s degree .
every few minutes , the video pauses and the students get asked a question .
it was tried only in small classes , but there it showed , for example , that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis .
the answers happen to be pairs of numbers , so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot .
he said that , &quot; college is a place where a professor &apos;s lecture notes go straight to the students &apos; lecture notes , without passing through the brains of either . &quot;
therefore every moment really is the most important moment that &apos;s ever happened , including this moment right now .
like polls . you know , it &apos;s always curious to me that in public opinion polls the percentage of americans who don &apos;t know the answer to any given question is always two percent .
the head is good , body bad .
the agony as an act of passion . &quot;
&quot; we have a lifelong emotional and financial commitment to our asian elephant partners . &quot;
and i was looking for a form that didn &apos;t have that .
he was a very selfish meme .
huh ? huh ? what ? can &apos;t hear you . &quot;
i still have a way to go .
it &apos;s an actual thing .
can we run that , andrew ?
you ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist , and put down your 10-dollar copay , and get treated , just like you do when you got a cut on your arm . it &apos;s ridiculous .
it wasn &apos;t really a research report ; it was a screed .
a lot of very sober-minded physicists , believe it or not , have had exactly the same thought .
this brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently , that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world , from biotechnology , that literally could destroy the world &apos;s food supply in very short order .
occasionally , we get a flare from the sun that causes havoc with communications and so forth , and electricity .
a staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it when antibiotics come , and change and mutate .
and for three months out of the year , the surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180 .
this is a chart that dr. clark chapman at the southwest research institute presented to congress a few years ago .
now , the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing is that you don &apos;t have anything to push against in space , because there &apos;s no air .
basho , in 17 syllables , juxtaposed a turbulent ocean driven by a storm now past , and captured the almost impossible beauty of our home galaxy with millions of stars , probably hundreds and hundreds of -- who knows how many -- planets , maybe even an ocean that we will probably call sylvia in time .
volcanoes erupt .
look at this diagram , which is showing warm waters in red , cool waters in blue , and on the continents , what you &apos;re seeing in bright green , is the growth of vegetation , and in olive green , the dieback of vegetation .
modeling : on the right hand side , there &apos;s a very complex computational model .
this is what it looks like .
we &apos;re flying across the caldera floor .
so in the volume of the ocean , we will know , not just the physics and the chemistry , but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data on a continuous basis .
it &apos;s going to be amazing .
wind and time have twisted our landscape into very strange shapes , and these shapes are speckled with wildlife to this harsh and strange land .
whenever we tried to hunt , we were called poachers .
the headman said : &quot; yes . our poachers . &quot;
and when this thing started going on , we started becoming one community , renewing our connection to nature .
conservancies are legally instituted institutions by the government , and these are run by the communities themselves , for their benefit .
i want to know how i impact them .
do i do this three times a week ?
and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood walmart .
a couple things happened .
invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
we &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
is it getting hotter or is it getting colder ?
we just had a number of cameras out on the greenland ice sheet .
if everybody in the developed world understood this graph , and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads , there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this is the story that counts .
you see the glacier flowing in from the right , dropping off into the sea , camera shooting every hour .
so , here &apos;s another time-lapse shot of columbia .
without the photographic process , you would never see this . this is invisible .
it now goes at 125 feet a day , dumping all this ice into the ocean .
james balog : time-lapse proof of extreme ice loss
once you take this , there &apos;s no reason to restrict innovation , the beneficiaries of innovation , just to end users .
what happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart , young , ambitious kids on a call center job ?
here is the profile of employees of ibm over the last decade .
i was emotionally feeling very isolated .
diarrheal diseases had been stuck .
and then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the united states at the time .
so anyway , additionally , there was still this problem , and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems .
best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment , births , strokes , heart disease , hip replacements , 4 a.m. emergencies .
no , feel free to follow along on your blackberries or your iphones if you &apos;ve got them .
marge simpson : homer , please .
in generations .
and as they land , they &apos;re fully aligned in the gravitational field .
we &apos;ll see two cells in the upper part of the screen attempting to divide .
importantly , it was the first time ever that the fda included in their approval of an oncology treatment a quality of life claim .
it doesn &apos;t interfere with computers or electrical equipment .
you can see the tumor treating field field generator , but importantly you can also see that she is living her life .
and in most parts it is saline , not fit for drinking .
but now you can have this for year round .
and the water level -- these are not empty canisters -- water level is right up to this .
well connected , 800 years ago , through europe .
the reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up .
don &apos;t spit , don &apos;t do anything wrong , so that the clean water can be collected .
they were using it on their body .
with wisdom and wit , anupam mishra talks about the amazing feats of engineering built centuries ago by the people of india &apos;s golden desert to harvest water . these structures are still used today -- and are often superior to modern water megaprojects .
africa , many african countries , are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of gdp .
i think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic ?
he won by a margin .
that new cover shows , well , africa rising , because the growth over the last 10 years has been about five and a half percent .
am i really saying that there can be nothing learned , yes from the positives in asia and india , but also the negatives ?
it was never popular with many political leaders , especially those in the united states who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn &apos;t .
so the only way to control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being , for example , a cia agent .
so from this perspective , having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great .
so for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of tehran , there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the world of warcraft .
there was a period of time when my wife -- her name is tammie -- and i , we just got real busy and whip , bam , boom : kendall and jay .
and the limousine empties out .
he was cool . he was fine .
so , like my mother would say , make a long story short , i just simply said to johnny , &quot; yes . &quot;
see collectively , we as men are taught to have less value in women , to view them as property and the objects of men .
we will overtake china by 2034 .
currently there are 509 million cellphones in indian hands , in india .
the other day i was in kerala , my home state , at the country farm of a friend , about 20 kilometers away from any place you &apos;d consider urban .
afghanistan , we know what a serious security problem afghanistan is for so many of us in the world .
it &apos;s a civilizational story to begin with .
and those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note , spelling out the denominations .
water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of 17 , i was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
after creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
and i said , why don &apos;t you use that ?
that will know how to find staph when it &apos;s in your body , and will alert your immune system to go after it .
to suggest that this all , sort of , about little , tiny creatures , i want to bring it close to home .
and it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true .
i thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things .
i &apos;d like to buy some concentrated , compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because i have these ideas , see , about wanting to suspend people .
and one of the things we wondered -- i &apos;m sure some of you out there are economists , and you know all about supply and demand .
also , the brilliant scientists who work at my lab and also others on staff , the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle , washington -- wonderful place to work .
you would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer .
if we hadn &apos;t , then probably this would be the height of sexiness .
now i &apos;m not going to have time to spell it all out , but i &apos;ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward .
and this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking .
and it &apos;s actually something that we invented a few years ago , or created a few years ago .
so , ah , that was fun .
any parents of young kids in the audience ? there must be some .
great . cool . so i was really interested in quantity .
so it was a pretty successful evening .
construction play -- it &apos;s playful , obviously , but also a powerful way to learn .
but by giving project teams and the clients who they &apos;re working with permission to think with their hands , quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily .
so we &apos;re very good , when acting out a solution , at spotting whether something lacks authenticity .
the first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy .
you can be serious and play .
and i got distracted by it .
i had fun again , i worked harder and , to cut a long story short , did all the things that took me back up to success .
and the choir conductor there knew that i sang and invited me to come and join the choir .
if there are noises in the night eric whitacre : i was thunderstruck .
and from the crowd emerged this young man , scott haines .
soprano : upon my pillow safe in bed ew : that &apos;s georgie from england . she &apos;s only nine .
so two things struck me deeply about this .
my values can be radically different from your values .
it is a technology that empowers the individual to determine its own life course , to shape itself .
for aristotle , ethics was not about the question , is that still good , or is it bad ?
because it presents and materializes a certain vision of the good life -- the good life in which teaching and learning and listening is about one person teaching , the others listening , in which it is about , learning is done while sitting , in which you learn for yourself , in which you &apos;re not supposed to change these rules because the chairs are fixed to the ground .
everyone is both a learner and a teacher .
we mostly avoid questions like , &quot; here &apos;s a formula , now tell me the value of y when x is equal to two . &quot;
now , the class ran 10 weeks , and in the end , about half of the 160,000 students watched at least one video each week , and over 20,000 finished all the homework , putting in 50 to 100 hours .
so , a quick strike like that . and if we slow it down a bit , this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species -- recorded at 1,000 frames a second , played back at 15 frames per second .
the whole limb extends out . the body flexes backwards -- just a spectacular movement .
and then we did a series of calculations , and what we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring .
and so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell .
and so here it is in the stomatopod . and again , this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon , because it destroys boat propellers .
it &apos;s a well-established fact of these animals that they actually bluff . they can &apos;t actually strike , but they pretend to .
well , it &apos;s the relative importance .
it actually is a very good working sub -- that &apos;s what it was designed for .
right now , i &apos;m just coming down on this gorgeous , big , giant manta ray .
we just learned so much in three hours in the water there .
the rational for the world &apos;s first flight school goes something like : when the coastguards come up to me and say -- they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things , but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous -- they would come up and say , &quot; do you have a license for that ? &quot;
now , we evolved in rather more challenging times than these , in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws .
first , of course , they killed some of the deer , but that wasn &apos;t the major thing .
one of the many post-rational excuses made by the japanese government for killing whales is that they said , &quot; well , the number of fish and krill will rise and then there &apos;ll be more for people to eat . &quot;
there &apos;s another one which suggests that 30 million hectares of land in europe , an area the size of poland , will be vacated by farmers between 2000 and 2030 .
the story rewilding tells us is that ecological change need not always proceed in one direction .
we then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad .
the lesson here is that some high-performance tasks are easier than others , and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard .
the following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds , or 50 times per second .
we can change this behavior , however .
thank you .
if you look here at this map , showing everything in blue is out in the water , and everything in yellow is upland .
finally , oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures .
this is an image of high school students , scuba divers that we worked with on our team .
no , what i want to do is take you back to 1854 in london for the next few minutes , and tell the story -- in brief -- of this outbreak , which in many ways , i think , helped create the world that we live in today , and particularly the kind of city that we live in today .
the public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say .
and you can see in this map , the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about 15 people dead .
this is tamdin .
and i &apos;d snuck in -- because it &apos;s totally illegal to have a picture of the dalai lama in tibet -- it &apos;s the quickest way you can get arrested .
and moi is 35 years old .
and then we went up and met their shaman .
so our dream is to bring teenagers together , so they &apos;ll have a community service experience as well as a cross-cultural experience , as they teach kids in these areas and help them build their communication infrastructure .
i thought i would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit , and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature .
so the question should come to your mind is , what kind of design , you know , what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that ?
the beginning of time is funny -- it &apos;s on the outside , right ?
i always think of space-time as being the real substance of space , and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean .
and you &apos;ll see , first , the structure of the survey , and then you &apos;ll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there .
and the stuff that is in the yellow color , that is the ordinary kind of matter that &apos;s turned into stars and galaxies .
and so you know when you first saw this picture , it didn &apos;t mean quite so much to you .
and then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on .
since then we &apos;ve had wmap , which just gives us higher angular resolution .
and yet , we don &apos;t take any time out to look after it .
there was a research paper that came out of harvard , just recently , that said on average our minds are lost in thought almost 47 percent of the time .
it does hurt . and we reinforce the storyline , right ?
and he actually took one look at my squiggly line , and said , &quot; well , why don &apos;t you just embrace the shake ? &quot;
and i realized , if i ever wanted my creativity back , i had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it .
it was destroyed before it ever existed .
my geiger counter dosimeter , which measures radiation , was going berserk , and the closer i got , the more frenetic it became , and frantic . my god .
another village might have six or seven residents .
home is a transient concept .
and so there you have it .
people explain to me that it &apos;s hard , but that it can be done .
but what might feel just right for that middle-aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop face-to-face relationships .
i believe this wish reflects a painful truth that i &apos;ve learned in the past 15 years .
and i believe it &apos;s because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable .
we almost don &apos;t feel ourselves .
start thinking of solitude as a good thing .
they need us .
so if the field &apos;s been around for so long , why so few clinical advances ?
these are stem cells that we create from specific sources , and we can drive them to become heart cells , and they start beating in culture .
so we can take these liver structures , which are not going to be used , and we then put them in a washing machine-like structure that will allow the cells to be washed away .
and now you &apos;re going to see here a demo of this actually being done in a representative wound .
this is actually the printer that you see here onstage .
i went through about 16 surgeries , and it seemed impossible to do that when i was in kidney failure when i was 10 .
on our shelves at home , we have a box set of the dvd series &quot; 24 , &quot; season six to be precise .
we now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties that used to happen face to face , but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before .
the reason why it &apos;s happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration .
one of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles is called landshare .
the results of this challenge after just one month was staggering .
i can see that rondoron has completed 553 trades with a 100 percent success rate .
and all of a sudden i passed the national examination , found myself in a very beautiful high school in kenya .
you &apos;ve got a good education from america , you have a good life in america ; what are you going to do for us ?
caitria o &apos;neill : that was me in front of our house in monson , massachusetts last june .
mo : so we started organizing .
we had to learn how to answer questions quickly and to solve problems in about a minute or less , because otherwise something more urgent would come up , and it just wouldn &apos;t get done .
in a disaster , however , you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity .
and we launched our platform .
after a natural disaster strikes , there &apos;s only a tiny window of opportunity to rally effective recovery efforts before the world turns their attention elsewhere . who should be in charge ? when a freak tornado hit their hometown , sisters caitria and morgan o &apos;neill -- just 20 and 24 at the time -- took the reins and are now teaching others how to do the same .
it was a 10 by 10 cell .
but it stood in jarring contrast to something armstrong had said as we were eating -- that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood .
and it &apos;s built to a pretty high standard of design .
talk about more plastic bags than plankton .
this woman is nine , which means &quot; grandma &quot; in turkish .
and this is why that &apos;s not entirely a good thing : because over the age of 65 , your risk of getting alzheimer &apos;s or parkinson &apos;s disease will increase exponentially .
because the clock is ticking for all of us .
the second reason that the new machine age is such great news is that , once the androids start doing jobs , we don &apos;t have to do them anymore , and we get freed up from drudgery and toil .
but the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now .
so i cannot tell a happy story about these social trends , and they don &apos;t show any signs of reversing themselves .
and we see very serious and sustained and data-driven efforts to understand how to intervene in some of the most troubled communities that we have .
i am a vicar in the church of england .
he wrote , &quot; if some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactly why all these deaths made sense , would we feel happier , or safer , or more confident in god ? &quot;
so we have a suffering god -- a god who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul .
afterwards someone said that god must have been looking after them .
if we believe something like this , we must let go of the puppet-master completely , take our leave of the almighty controller , abandon traditional models .
is god just another name for the universe , with no independent existence at all ?
no neat packages of faith , with bible references to prove them .
it &apos;s not roads , or penicillin , or factory tires ; it &apos;s the new stuff .
it was a very short life . but at the same time anthropologists know that most hunter-gatherer tribes of the world , with that very little technology , actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food that they needed : three to six hours a day .
so , humanity is our greatest invention .
and the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a pc chip .
and with that entire wealth of england , king henry could not buy any antibiotics , he could not buy refrigeration , he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles .
but that &apos;s a really good idea ; that &apos;s a good job for technology .
thank you so much everyone from ted , and chris and amy in particular .
but everyone that i knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word in terms of nurturing a democracy , nurturing an enlightened life .
here you see planks sold by the foot and we have supplies to combat scurvy .
she took over as executive director .
there &apos;s a lot of cross-pollination . the only problem , especially for the adults working at mcsweeney &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one bathroom .
so , meanwhile , there &apos;s an adult in the back typing this up , taking it completely seriously , which blows their mind .
and we said , &quot; isabel allende is going to read all your essays at the end .
people would come in and say , &quot; what the -- ?
this is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there , it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism , which you do , if you want to buy anything . and it limits , really , their sales .
came in . got this concentrated attention .
i know that for a fact . so , tell us these stories and inspire others on the website .
i woke up in the middle of the night with the sound of heavy explosion .
&quot; war , &quot; a friend of mine said , &quot; is not about sound at all .
how interesting .
we must have a full picture of what that means .
she was sending them to school . have a new home .
you know , there &apos;s also something called the &quot; complete idiot &apos;s guide ? &quot;
and cape cod , there are idyllic roads , and all of us can drive in this room .
that &apos;s my baby reina . thank you .
and also ikko tanaka was a very important mentor in my life -- the paul rand of japan . he designed most of the major icons of japan , like issey miyake &apos;s brand and also muji .
i built things in a time-graphics dimension .
i took these to tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects .
and each butter-fry is composed of different pieces .
anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie , which cookie are they going to take ? the big cookie .
and if you have your vision , vision is interesting .
and when we change our behavior in our daily lives , we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part . in order to be optimistic about this , we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy .
that puts a lot of pressure on greenland .
so here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
you &apos;ve seen this slide before , but there &apos;s a change .
a challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do ? i think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which , a thousand years from now , philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying , they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future .
buckminster fuller once wrote , &quot; if the future of all human civilization depended on me , what would i do ?
other people are not as elastic .
so they &apos;re working on enhancing everything : touch , smell -- everything they can , in order to find the perfect mate .
in this particular case a section will be devoted to information design .
it used to be called rapid prototyping , rapid modeling .
design for debate is a very interesting new endeavor that designers have really shaped for themselves .
and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning , and what we can do about it today with new technologies .
if we can get enough of these streams of information together , we can perhaps start to understand the war .
we didn &apos;t really understand that .
can we create the kind of patterns that we &apos;re seeing in places like iraq ?
and the system gets perturbed . it moves upwards to a fragmented state .
this , in a way , is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea .
and , of course , you can &apos;t do that unless you understand yourself a bit more .
what does this compassion entail ?
and as he was dozing off , they were reading from the book of leviticus in the torah .
every week , the cleaner would come . &quot; god you &apos;ve answered my plea again . &quot;
and it &apos;s from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning , that pain is a disease .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that .
it changes , and it morphs in response to stimuli .
okay ?
to give you a sense of scale , this is about a mile wide .
let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer for 65 million years . they &apos;re very rare .
in fact , apophis is a blessing in disguise , because it woke us up to the dangers of these things .
i think even nasa can do that , and they proved that they can .
it generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand , incredibly light , but it can run for months and years , providing that very gentle push .
so they &apos;re deprived of understanding their reality .
so i prepared two plans for that meeting , two strategic plans : the small one and the big one .
he said , i &apos;ll give you a rope to hang yourself .
it &apos;s not a bank . we had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them -- by establishing management systems , by providing all that knowledge , how do you run a business on one side -- while they all know how to run , how to create content .
he goes and sees the governor . the governor says , boris nikolayevich , i understand you are doing a great job , and you are the most respected newspaper in our district .
all of those , not all , half of those problems mentioned last night -- government accountability , corruption , how do you fight corruption , giving voice to unheard , to poor -- it &apos;s why independent media is in business .
you can , once you have all of those different points , you can make it easy for investors .
well , here &apos;s an example from my own experience .
we may not even be terribly far from it .
now , it &apos;s often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies , and then higher energies , and then higher energies , or short distances , and then shorter distances , and then still shorter distances , and so on , is like peeling the skin of an onion .
they are symmetries of the sphere .
they hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics -- didn &apos;t . it didn &apos;t , by itself , contribute to particle physics .
it stems from the character of gravity .
we perish , they survive ; we have one life , they have many lives , and in each life they can mean different things .
it is , of course , a great moment in the history of the jewish people .
&quot; thus said cyrus , king of persia , &apos; all the kingdoms of the earth have the lord god of heaven given thee , and he has charged me to build him a house in jerusalem .
but what cyrus represented remained absolutely central .
the hebrew writers in the old testament , you will not be surprised to learn , take a rather different view of this .
and so the shah invents an iranian history , or a return to iranian history , that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the cyrus cylinder .
here you see this out-sized cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of iran .
during the first three years of life , the brain grows to its full size , with most of that growth taking place in the first six months . the brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation .
at 8 , their nappies must be changed , so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children .
if we spend less on these children but on the right services , we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs .
and that fascinated me , because i &apos;d been messing around with a camera most of my life .
and i wanted it to be the 21st of september because it was my granddad &apos;s favorite number .
for me , it was really about the process .
i felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day .
and i remember thinking , &quot; this is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder .
but even if it doesn &apos;t , at least the door is open and there &apos;s a chance . &quot;
and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .
and that completely blew my mind almost more than anything .
we have to work together .
thanks a lot .
and i thought about this concept of , imagine if we could reprogram our own body odor , modify and biologically enhance it , and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other ?
it took quite many years for the program to become what it is now .
you know , when you want to forget , you don &apos;t want to see things , so you just want to go to your room , to lock yourself inside and say , &quot; that &apos;s enough . &quot;
maybe the machinery is broken .
i said , &quot; no , please . we cannot do that .
it was april , i remember , a very beautiful day .
he was in good shape -- a bit thinner .
i sat down too with goosebumps everywhere .
i understood that i was wrong again .
so employing people , yes , but also we started programming projects of microfinance , education .
well now you should see me .
the second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia .
we had just had a military coup , and soldiers were pervasive in our society .
they wanted us to think critically .
somebody trained them to do the work that they do .
because it seems to me that every society , every society , must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders .
now , we cannot achieve perfection , but if we reach for it , then we can achieve excellence .
it &apos;s an incredible opportunity .
and i &apos;ll tell you why .
happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces .
this is a full bottle of calms forte .
billions of dollars are spent every year , all over the globe , on these charlatans .
john edward , sylvia browne and rosemary altea , they are other operators .
now , sylvia browne -- just to show you -- she actually gets 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone , she doesn &apos;t even go there in person , and you have to wait up to two years because she &apos;s booked ahead that amount of time .
all you have to do is prove any paranormal , occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions .
i just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills .
maybe these people are just independently wealthy .
she cashed in the cds , she gave away the stocks and the certificates .
and when it does , it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities , can fix it , can source the parts and keep it saving lives .
she was able to anesthetize her quickly , and it was important because of the emergency nature of the situation .
and the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous .
this machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that i showed you earlier .
what if you &apos;re in surgery and the power goes out ? no lights , no oxygen -- and your anesthesia stops flowing . it happens constantly in hospitals throughout the world , turning routine procedures into tragedies . erica frenkel demos one solution : the universal anesthesia machine . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and here we see three stages of development that it went through in 30 years .
i &apos;m not a vegetarian -- this is the old nixon line , right ?
and those calories are in foods that cause , not prevent , disease .
yet they do that .
and locavore , for those of you who don &apos;t know , is someone who eats only locally grown food -- which is fine if you live in california , but for the rest of us it &apos;s a bit of a sad joke .
vitamins had not been invented .
what could be easier , more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak ?
we weren &apos;t all hippies , either .
but organic food isn &apos;t the answer either , at least not the way it &apos;s currently defined .
but don &apos;t we need meat to be big and strong ?
thank you .
i &apos;ve been doing it for the last year , and it &apos;s great .
what happens if facebook , google , twitter , linkedin , cell phones , gps , foursquare , yelp , travel advisor , all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos ?
with all this data out here , it might be a good idea not to look too far into the past of those you love .
and in proportion , what would the size of the sphere and the length , and what would the taper be to the earth ?
ts : no .
and they can pinch them very tight and stop it , or you can have them wide open .
there are lots of things that appear .
and i think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature , humans are of the universe .
and he could shoot it from two rooms away and not damage what it was on because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly and not damage what it landed on .
i &apos;m going to do an international biennial ; i need artists from all around the world .
this piece was great . this is in my parents &apos; backyard in arkansas .
this artist is gus weinmueller , and he &apos;s doing a project , a large project , called &quot; art for the peoples . &quot;
and she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments , or they could be like these , which are leaves that can be payments .
so he pairs these up .
the next artist is k. m. yoon , a really interesting south korean artist .
and she &apos;s an optometrist in st. petersburg , and she plays with optics .
but in the twentieth century , a japanese folder named yoshizawa came along , and he created tens of thousands of new designs .
if you look at the angles around the fold , you find that if you number the angles in a circle , all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line , all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line .
what &apos;s the most abstract form ? it &apos;s a stick figure .
there &apos;s other ways of making flaps .
and if you want a different deer , you change the packing , and you can do an elk .
computers made things move , but these were all real , folded objects that we made .
but this pattern &apos;s not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters .
the airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects -- things with legs .
fn : can you bring out our baby ?
in american fertility clinics , 75 percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys .
and labor statistics : women take up most managerial jobs .
but of course , it &apos;s not about that .
people have asked men , why don &apos;t they just go back to college , to community college , say , and retool themselves , learn a new set of skills ?
and this was kind of a shocker to me .
and sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child so they could have a male child .
and we have a lot of skill and experience , but it &apos;s a trick , so how are you supposed to prepare to get through that glass ceiling ?
and the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting .
and it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it &apos;s china , greece , the hindu civilization , or the mayas , or egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies , not about their everyday life .
whether it &apos;s mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before .
there &apos;s this focus that , once it becomes intense , leads to a sense of ecstasy , a sense of clarity : you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other ; you get immediate feedback .
the largest single contributor to that experience is watching television ; the next one is being in the bathroom , sitting .
pretty cool , huh ? we think so .
and this gap between the west and the rest has created a mindset of the world , which we still use linguistically when we talk about &quot; the west &quot; and &quot; the developing world . &quot;
i was in shanghai recently , and i listened to what &apos;s happening in china , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will catch up , just as japan did .
and down here , child survival , the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries .
with green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty , and global governance , the world can become like this .
now , we know about smoking , deep-fried mars bars , chips -- the glasgow diet .
and here &apos;s this incredibly simple molecule , a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together , and yet these are hugely important for &#91; unclear &#93; our low blood pressure , for neurotransmission , for many , many things , but particularly cardiovascular health .
not by much , as an individual level , but enough at a population level to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population .
so we thought we &apos;d just kind of model -- different amounts of uv hit different parts of the earth at different times of year , so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide -- the nitrates , nitrites , nitrosothiols in the skin -- cleave to release no .
how much sunlight is safe , and how can we finesse this best for our general health ?
wouldn &apos;t it be great if our bodies could regenerate ?
this is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body .
but actually , before placing the scaffold into the patient , we actually exercise it .
hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity , because you &apos;re asking these organs to act on demand .
we exercise these prior to implantation .
we actually take the donor liver , we use very mild detergents , and we , by using these mild detergents , we take all the cells out of the liver .
if we cannot use smart biomaterials , then we &apos;d rather use your very own cells .
and there you see the stagecoach driver , and he goes , on the top panel , he goes a , b , c , d , e , f .
anthony atala &apos;s state-of-the-art lab grows human organs -- from muscles to blood vessels to bladders , and more . at tedmed , he shows footage of his bio-engineers working with some of its sci-fi gizmos , including an oven-like bioreactor and a machine that &quot; prints &quot; human tissue .
we could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts .
ted turner &apos;s got it . steve jobs has it .
is it thing one or thing two ? what is it ?
and i remember this one customer so vividly because i also did some other stuff with these clients .
i also learned , don &apos;t reveal your source , because i got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where i was buying my comics from , and he didn &apos;t like the fact that he was paying a lot more .
and you &apos;d make these chairs .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense . &quot; you just figure out a way to make more money faster .
i sold sunglasses , when i was in school , to all the kids in high school .
come to me and tell me what it is .
those are entrepreneurial traits that you want to be nurturing .
we wouldn &apos;t have have that stuff , right ?
in truth , liberal arts education no longer exists -- at least genuine liberal arts education -- in this country .
when the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough , i can assure you , to give one pause , what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable .
bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives .
when improvisation , resourcefulness , imagination are key , artists , at long last , take their place at the table , when strategies of action are in the process of being designed .
people will continue and should continue to learn everything there is to know about something or other .
wikipedia reports that this guy , this former congressman from erie , pennsylvania was , at the age of 20 , one of the youngest people at the republican national convention , but it &apos;s just not true .
these very same people are strong believers , in lots of contexts , in the limits on the markets .
and so they &apos;re beautiful , but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this .
the point is they , he , here , gets that culture .
the creator is a sharecropper in this story .
i answered , &quot; no . &quot; i didn &apos;t even think about it .
so here &apos;s the lessons of openness that i think we need to learn .
so we see a lot of this .
and then through a series of steps , he &apos;d move them and they &apos;d be standing in the doorway with the door open and they &apos;d be looking in there .
he &apos;s worked for ge , and he &apos;s had a fantastic career .
but doug &apos;s results that he cared about were much more qualitative .
and they just make better decisions .
we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building , and to do this , we sampled dust .
and that is exactly what we found .
thank you .
so spinning forward , one of the guys who read this article was a guy called doug engelbart , and he was a u.s. air force officer .
they had a 12-page supplement in the wall street journal the day it launched .
and the very next year , in 1994 , we had the conference here in edinburgh , and i had no opposition in having tim berners-lee as the keynote speaker .
these humpback whales were getting killed .
and this was the final vote . when all was cleared ...
and one of the great lessons that greenpeace actually learned was that it &apos;s okay to lose control .
there &apos;s spring , summer , autumn and â   voice : my favorite season is winter.mt : well yeah , mine too .
i don &apos;t literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week .
that &apos;s just a decade away .
i &apos;m thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like guanxi , confucian values and so on .
we were wrong . why were we wrong ?
hence their attitude , for example , to the uyghurs and to the tibetans .
i mean , it &apos;s leading firms -- many of them are still publicly owned .
i mean , take the question of east asia .
it doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
speaking at a salon in london , economist martin jacques asks : how do we in the west make sense of china and its phenomenal rise ? the author of &quot; when china rules the world , &quot; he examines why the west often puzzles over the growing power of the chinese economy , and offers three building blocks for understanding what china is and will become .
and i was sitting in a hallway one night and a couple girls came up to me .
and i see , even more importantly , the power of music to connect hearts .
i can &apos;t do anything to save the world . &quot;
because i was just 18 and i was just up there on the top of the champs-elysees .
so with my friend marco , we decided to go there and see who are the real palestinians and who are the real israelis .
we &apos;re pasting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market .
when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents , i couldn &apos;t always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict .
then the next day , i held a meeting on the main square and some women came .
we kept traveling .
so the people kept it .
for each project we do a film .
but yesterday the city called them and said , &quot; look , you &apos;re going to have to tear it down .
actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions , and then enables you to change the world .
it &apos;s essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff , with the things in our lives .
how many people here have experienced car-sharing or bike-sharing ?
and so it &apos;s not only an option for them , but i believe it &apos;s an imperative for zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us , to be like a concierge service .
it allows us as owners to have other options .
so i was having a coffee in portland , and half-of-a-latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in 16 minutes .
and one quick example is velib , in 2007 , came forward in paris with a very bold proposition , a very big bike-sharing service .
it did this a thousand years ago .
there will be invisible capacity . invisible capacity in our bodies , in our brains , and in the air .
the employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people .
it is vital that we do so .
she &apos;s a bit of a hippie .
and what happened was , to my luck , i saw a nuclear scientist at whose party i had done cartoons .
i said , &quot; oh , my god . what is that ? &quot;
and then i was fortunate enough to actually perform this in california with velocity circus .
this is a painting i did of my wife in my apartment .
something happened along the line .
i started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind .
this time i said let &apos;s try something different .
so i said , okay .
sw : much better . well , einstein is very honored to be here at ted 2006 , amongst all you modern-day einsteins . in fact , she &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you fell down .
you were saying that you were really embarrassed , because you &apos;re in love with a pirate ?
e : happy birthday to you .
e : stinker .
my parents found it necessary for peace of mind .
and i would like to share my art .
the only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water .
in freestyle , easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll , and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water .
i couldn &apos;t read any of it -- hieroglyphics , it could have been -- because it was kanji , chinese characters adapted into the japanese language .
from that point , you can then , if you want to , acquire multiple languages , alternate them so there is no interference .
she came back . she goes , &quot; come on . i don &apos;t have all day . &quot;
his name is gabriel misse .
and when i think of what i fear now , it &apos;s very simple .
first of all , we wanted small schools -- about 300 , 400 pupils -- 14 to 19 year-olds , and critically , about 80 percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms , but through real-life , practical projects , working on commission to businesses , ngo &apos;s and others .
and this one is focused on creative and media industries .
they &apos;re originally from crete . they &apos;re a seafaring people .
he issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him .
this is an incredibly devastating weapon .
so to begin with , the bible says that goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant .
there &apos;s even speculation that abraham lincoln had acromegaly .
that night , i was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis .
and what &apos;s amazing , when you use this technology , for example , looking at humans , we &apos;re not just covered in a sea of microbes .
and one area that i think is very interesting , which many of you may have now that we &apos;ve thrown microbes into the crowd , is something that i would call &quot; germophobia . &quot;
studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this , but people are now using these technologies because they &apos;ve gotten very cheap , to study the microbes in and on a variety of people .
so when yochai is talking about new methods of organization , he &apos;s exactly describing wikipedia . and what i &apos;m going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside .
or &quot; who does that ? &quot; and the answer is : anybody who wants to pitch in .
so it &apos;s a slight misquote . the articles were edited quite heavily .
so real-time peer review .
the tools and the software : there &apos;s lots of tools that allow us -- allow us , meaning the community -- to self-monitor and to monitor all the work .
now it is true that at the end of the day an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say , ok , 18 deletes , two keeps : we &apos;ll delete it .
well , i don &apos;t like the term &quot; benevolent dictator , &quot; and i don &apos;t think that it &apos;s my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world .
it builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers .
he stood over six feet tall .
pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you .
in fact , the same brain region where we found activity becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine .
and indeed , it &apos;s this part of the brain , the core of the nucleus accumbens , actually , that is becoming active as you &apos;re measuring your gains and losses .
so , one thing i would like the medical community , and the legal community , and even the college community , to see if they can understand , that indeed , romantic love is one of the most addictive substances on earth .
and so , i &apos;ve spent the last three years on this .
this is intimacy to women .
it &apos;s a &quot; feel the fear and do it anyway &quot; kind of thing .
so our first critical moment , it &apos;s open .
it &apos;s really an unreal feeling , because normally you have a big thing , a plane , around you .
and up i climb , i turn .
and yeah , that &apos;s all .
this is risky stuff indeed .
so just as a curiosity , where did you land when you flew over the grand canyon ?
thanks to the increasing technology , better technology , it will be safe .
that all that , discovered in 40 years , had not been in the previous hundred thousand , was not for lack of thinking about stars , and all those other urgent problems they had .
well , we &apos;ve seen that that can &apos;t be true .
what we see , in all these cases , bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible -- only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them .
so what was wrong with that myth , and with all pre-scientific thinking , and what , then , made that momentous difference ?
if they &apos;d been observed in phase , the theory would have been refuted .
but it looks like -- i &apos;m guessing -- that it &apos;ll be about 60 percent of the room because that &apos;s roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction .
now , these aren &apos;t the only pair in the world .
i got to the airport , to the hotel , checked in , and , sitting there in the lobby , was a brochure for the sydney festival . i thumbed through it , and i came across a show called &quot; minto : live . &quot;
the old festivals , they continued to thrive , but from brighton to rio to perth , something new was emerging , and these festivals were really different .
we can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals on their cities , but i &apos;m much &#91; more &#93; interested in many more things , like how a festival helps a city to express itself , how it lets it come into its own .
i hope you will enjoy .
what i find amazing is that africa is transcending its geography problem .
we are humbled that this has roots in kenya and that it has some use to people around the world trying to figure out the different issues that they &apos;re dealing with .
we wanted to redesign the modem for the developing world , for our context , and for our reality .
i will close by saying that , if we solve this for the local market , it could be impactful not only for the coders in nairobi but also for small business owners who need reliable connectivity , and it can reduce the cost of connecting , and hopefully collaboration within african countries .
if you search amazon for the word &quot; creativity , &quot; you &apos;ll discover something like 90,000 books .
there are charts which show all these movements of information . that density of information is amazing .
and i think this is our challenge , because somebody has actually increased — and it &apos;s probably you guys with all your tech and stuff — the speed , the scale and the density of interaction .
thank you , thank you .
what i proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that .
suppose that two american friends are traveling together in italy .
i &apos;m going to ask you to raise your hand , whether you are liberal , left of center -- on social issues , we &apos;re talking about , primarily -- or conservative , and i &apos;ll give a third option , because i know there are a number of libertarians in the audience .
what is morality and where does it come from ?
sports is to war as pornography is to sex .
so , as you see , people care about harm and care issues .
because liberals like to say , &quot; fetch , please . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to be a sucker . i &apos;m not going to cooperate . &quot;
but it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups , and if those sub-groups have some internal structure , and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality , to pursue higher , nobler ends .
two of them are vishnu , the preserver , and shiva , the destroyer .
and if you do that , that &apos;s the essential move to cultivate moral humility , to get yourself out of this self-righteousness , which is the normal human condition .
they don &apos;t know whether this person &apos;s hostile or not .
yes , you don &apos;t have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different .
there was a spike , of course , a few years before , but that wasn &apos;t actually queensland .
so chechens had come in and taken control of the theater .
the person who &apos;s spraying the o.c. spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don &apos;t get contaminated and so on .
apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed .
we use words like &quot; grasp &quot; metaphorically to also think about understanding things .
dd : this is something i call &quot; swinging in the rain . &quot;
makers are in control .
this is andrew archer .
and you can &apos;t see this very well on the screen , but arduino -- arduino is an open-source hardware platform .
this is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space .
this is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it &apos;s all about sex tips .
but in fact , with all due respect to hedy -- about whom we &apos;ll hear more later -- there &apos;s a lot more to it .
she is graceful , she is mysterious and she is transcendent , and those are the central qualities of glamour .
there are few things more glamorous than the horizon -- except , possibly , multiple horizons .
and , you know , this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because , like sunglasses , it conceals and reveals at the same time .
&quot; the matrix &quot; is a movie that is all about glamour .
she &apos;s very glamorous but , you know , she invented spread-spectrum technology .
i worried that &#91; if &#93; i took my hat off i wouldn &apos;t be here anymore .
my father was really kind to me on my 16th birthday , for example .
i heard about a little girl who couldn &apos;t stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her .
i know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation , the 16 ounces of puss , is the contaminated gulf of mexico , and there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me and dead floating fish .
it was my head that was bald -- and comfortable now without a hat .
it was all these things in the water , in the world , in my body .
and i &apos;m going to tell you just our first few steps about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about other people &apos;s thoughts .
and ivan puts his sandwich over here , on top of the pirate chest .
which sandwich is he going to take ?
he says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches .
and perhaps unsurprisingly , if grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend &apos;s coffee , people say she deserves no blame at all .
and we can use that same pulse , now applied to the rtpj , to ask if we can change people &apos;s moral judgments .
so , there &apos;s a couple of things to say about tms .
that &apos;s a great answer . rebecca saxe , thank you very much . that was fantastic .
and sometimes it takes a wake-up call , doesn &apos;t it , to alert us to the fact that we &apos;re hurrying through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we &apos;re living the fast life , instead of the good life .
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nub of the question , which is how we think about time itself .
and out of the slow food movement has grown something called the slow cities movement , which has started in italy , but has spread right across europe and beyond .
now , clearly there are problems with the 35-hour workweek in france -- too much , too soon , too rigid .
one is that speed is fun , you know , speed is sexy .
i still love speed . you know , i live in london , and i work as a journalist , and i enjoy the buzz and the busyness , and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things .
is that a good luck on the book tour card ? &quot;
it was , what i would say , compositional complexity , and i felt that if i had to fulfill what i talked about -- a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a generating idea , some kind of a generating geometry .
well , they said , &quot; people won &apos;t understand , they &apos;ll think it &apos;s a discotheque . you can &apos;t do that . &quot;
and half a million people gathered for the celebrations ; you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning .
you see the structure as , in the sequence of structures on the mall , very transparent and inviting and looking in .
looking back over his long career , architect moshe safdie delves into four of his design projects and explains how he labored to make each one truly unique for its site and its users .
see , these are all right inside of the color palette .
we know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing .
shalom . sat sri akal .
my name is papusay .
one of a dozen pakistanis who came to tedindia despite security hassles entering the country , fellow asher hasan shows photos of ordinary pakistanis that drive home a profound message for citizens of all nations : look beyond disputes , and see the humanity we share .
and the way it works is , it comes from the southwest .
now , the particular species of dragonfly i want to talk about is this one , because most dragonflies , like the one we &apos;ve just seen , when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life , it doesn &apos;t go very far . it can &apos;t travel very far .
and they were there for some time . and then they were gone .
those of you who are indian or spent your childhood here , let me have a show of hands , who of you -- not yet , not yet !
it stretches about 500 miles , of course it &apos;s india here .
that &apos;s the inter-monsoon , the time when the monsoon changes .
they only take six weeks . instead of 11 months , they &apos;re six weeks .
the dragonflies are here now . they &apos;re breeding there .
but dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing .
this fellow is a very nice bird , this is the pied cuckoo .
i played a little baseball , did a few other things like that , but i always had the sense of being an outsider , and it wasn &apos;t until i saw pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate , i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s for me , &quot; you know ?
so , as humbling and rotten as it was — and believe me , it was rotten . i would go to skate spots , and i was already , like , &quot; famous guy , &quot; right ?
it would give out on me . and i would watch the guys , i &apos;d go to this warehouse where a lot of the guys were skating , my friends , and i was like , &quot; man i gotta do something new . i want to do something new .
and so this is what i want to emphasize that , as you can imagine , all of these tricks are made of sub-movements , executive motor functions , more granular to the degree to which i can &apos;t quite tell you , but one thing i do know is , every trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements . and so , as i &apos;m going up , these things are floating around , and you have to sort of let the cognitive mind , like , rest back , pull it back a little bit , and let your intuition go as you feel these things .
it doesn &apos;t make them good people , but it &apos;s at the heart of engineering , at the heart of a creative community , an innovative community , and the open source community , the basic ethos of it is , take what other people do , make it better , give it back so we all rise further .
so you &apos;ve really reinvented yourself in the past from freestyle to street , and , i think it was about four years ago you officially retired . is that it ? what &apos;s next ?
and carl norden is very firmly in the former camp .
but he said , with the mark 15 norden bombsight , he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft .
so what happens during the second world war ?
and of those 10 percent that landed , 16 percent didn &apos;t even go off ; they were duds .
oh no , they were brilliantly accurate .
the issue isn &apos;t the accuracy of the bombs you have , it &apos;s how you use the bombs you have , and more importantly , whether you ought to use bombs at all .
so now , we are going to speak of happiness .
it is something that -- changes of nature .
there might be storms , but the depth of the ocean is still there , unchanged .
and so , if we look from our own experience , anger , hatred , jealousy , arrogance , obsessive desire , strong grasping , they don &apos;t leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it .
so , there are natural antidotes to emotions that are destructive to our inner well-being .
a violinist , as we heard , who has done 10,000 hours of violin practice , some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain change a lot , increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections .
if you have a bout of depression , you &apos;ll go to the right side .
and just , i leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than i could ever say .
and given that we do -- and that &apos;s the assumption everybody , i think , in this room would make -- when was that ?
how do we study that ?
human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30 , 40 years ago -- carlton coon is the best example -- had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-darwinian era -- for over a million years , since the time of homo erectus .
if you take all the dna out of one cell in your body , and stretch it end to end , it &apos;s around two meters long .
was it millions of years ago , which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world ?
now , africa is the most tropical continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between cancer and capricorn -- and there aren &apos;t a lot of glaciers here , except on the high mountains here in east africa .
the population size started to expand .
what do you want to do next ? &quot;
they apply to this fund in order to do various projects , and i &apos;ll show you a couple of examples .
eric beinhocker estimates that in new york city alone , there are some 10 billion skus , or distinct commodities , being traded .
and we &apos;ve crossed our first threshold .
and each cloud is compacted , gravity gets more powerful as density increases , the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud , and then , at the center of each cloud , the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees , protons start to fuse , there &apos;s a huge release of energy , and , bam !
in the center of a star , there &apos;s so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again .
so , it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean .
they accumulate information , they learn .
i hope you agree that this is a powerful story .
a lot of people buy the biggest house they can afford , and actually slightly bigger than that .
low-income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries .
one out of 10 are saving enough .
or as some economists call it , present bias .
in germany , 12 percent check the box .
those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch .
that way , when they make more money , when they get a pay raise , they don &apos;t have to cut their spending .
if you think about people and mortgages and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it , we need to think about that .
so we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce elizabeth , and i said , &quot; ok , maybe i am too bollywood .
all preparation is preparation .
so that &apos;s what i do .
and then when i would run out of that story , i would imagine that woodcutter &apos;s universe is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter .
i have to tell a story but i have the potential .
so what was i doing ?
my bitches wear my collars .
the architecture is telling a story about how , even though she &apos;s the most powerful woman in the world at that time , there is the other , the architecture &apos;s bigger .
so my next film is called &quot; paani &quot; which means water .
that first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other .
gave it more love and care than my own child .
you &apos;ve gone through hundreds of tv channels , just switching channel after channel , and then suddenly you actually stop on one .
a well told promise is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot and propels you forward through the story to the end .
that &apos;s what &apos;s so special about stories , they &apos;re not a widget , they aren &apos;t exact .
and that &apos;s why change is fundamental in story .
and we got a hold of that fax .
we realized , you can make him kind , generous , funny , considerate , as long as one condition is met for him , is that he stays the top toy .
look .
i don &apos;t know if i really believe that .
what i found was , i started working with refugees and famine victims -- small farmers , all , or nearly all -- who had been dispossessed and displaced .
everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of brazil nuts because we would buy it otherwise .
there &apos;s no more of it .
they &apos;re all going to consume twice as much as they currently do -- scientists , again , agree -- because income is going to grow in developing countries five times what it is today -- on global average , about &#91; 2.9 &#93; .
is a bad feeder lot operation for beef better or worse than a bad grazing operation for beef ?
we have to work in these places .
a hundred companies , we can work with .
if they don &apos;t have commodities , they don &apos;t have a business .
mars is also on a similar journey .
the issue isn &apos;t what to think , it &apos;s how to think .
but how to make it happen ?
this was amazing .
i mean , how is it possible ?
and this is a radically new concept that may apply to other neurological disorders , what i termed &quot; personalized neuroprosthetics , &quot; where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces , i implanted throughout the nervous system , in the brain , in the spinal cord , even in peripheral nerves , based on patient-specific impairments .
my dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the prime of his life .
what he said , that all too often , is that we accept the distance between those two ideas .
and by getting a good education , you too can control your own destiny .
it &apos;s an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations .
i can &apos;t make noise .
so i would like to share this piece with you .
the limitation was that they didn &apos;t have any money .
and , in a way , that &apos;s exactly how packets move around the internet , sometimes in as many as 25 or 30 hops , with the intervening entities that are passing the data around having no particular contractual or legal obligation to the original sender or to the receiver .
and within two minutes , it reverberates around and youtube is blocked everywhere in the world .
jimbo &apos;s idea was for nupedia .
not because it &apos;s a job , not because it &apos;s a career , but because it &apos;s a calling .
i mean , this is a 2005 business week cover .
and we now have means that we can build , like this system , so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it .
so , my urging , my thought , is that the internet isn &apos;t just a pile of information .
now , some people have criticized us for this .
but let &apos;s step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started pisa , and i &apos;m giving them a colored bubble now .
let &apos;s go back to the year 2000 .
or take korea , at the other end of the spectrum .
but usually that is linked to very strong social disparities .
the goal of the past was standardization and compliance .
if we can help every child , every teacher , every school , every principal , every parent see what improvement is possible , that only the sky is the limit to education improvement , we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives .
and i will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in india , in china , will reach that of the west .
and i will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a gapminder graph here , where you can see each bubble is a country .
and then after the first world war , they continue up .
and it was deng xiaoping coming out here .
now in india , the big inequities are within the state , rather than between the states .
and after second world war , united states is richer than u.k .
now , a historian tells me it &apos;s even more difficult to predict about the past .
so i &apos;m going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe , what it &apos;s made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are -- at least some of the big questions .
so we see the galaxy and fixate on that , but it &apos;s actually a cloud of dark matter that &apos;s dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy .
well , we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye , right ?
and so , this is your instrument , ok .
and also , you can tell by eye , by looking at this , that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies .
the startling answer to this question , ok , from these experiments , was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago , ok .
one or both , who knows ? or it could be something completely different .
we discovered bluegrass a few years ago , and we fell in love with it . we hope you guys will too .
and you can understand , obviously , the transmission problem between people in high-virus areas .
and these are used with traces of blood visible .
and i &apos;m not really going to talk much about the economy .
if version 10 is coming out next week , there &apos;s no point in adding more functionality into version nine .
even if you only cared about aids in africa , it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria , in combating poor indoor air quality , in improving maternal mortality rates .
so i can tell you what the prevalence was in kenya in 2003 , but i can &apos;t tell you anything about 1993 or 1983 .
and i said in the beginning , i wasn &apos;t going to tell you about exports .
it &apos;s been replicated in kenya , and tanzania , and south africa and many other places .
emily oster re-examines the stats on aids in africa from an economic perspective and reaches a stunning conclusion : everything we know about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
and there was a wasp &apos;s nest that i had let grow in my yard , right outside my door .
this is a story about an engineer at j.r. west .
this is a little critter that &apos;s in the namibian desert .
it &apos;s actually a company a company that i &apos;m involved in called onesun , with paul hawken .
in our world we use about 350 polymers to make all this .
here &apos;s a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale .
and what we &apos;re trying to do , in a tedesque way , is to organize all biological information by design and engineering function .
we depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat .
thank you .
and my father used to say at that time , &quot; i &apos;m going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world . &quot;
i joined the indian police service as a tough woman , a woman with indefatigable stamina , because i used to run for my tennis titles , etc .
let &apos;s lock her up . &quot;
we converted this into an ashram -- from a prison to an ashram through education .
not by preaching , not by telling , not by reading , but by addressing your mind .
and the reason it is there is to make sure you , the entity filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times .
and the answer to that is &quot; yes , &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
facebook : every time you add a friend or poke somebody , you help to digitize a book .
some of them are very cute .
if you don &apos;t know any english , you can &apos;t access it .
so we need people to translate the whole web .
people really , really want to learn a foreign language .
you can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
we haven &apos;t yet launched this duolingo .
it &apos;s natural for me . me and my friends , i can connect to them easily .
so i actually know a lot about building a peer platform now , and a peers , inc. company , because i &apos;ve spent the last two years doing that in paris .
and after a year , we have 1,000 cars that are parked across france and 6,000 people who are members and eager to drive them .
the paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically , we haven &apos;t actually gotten any happier .
maybe these people are right . maybe mind-wandering is a bad thing .
well , how often do people &apos;s minds wander ?
and shortly after , we left the country , and we returned to switzerland .
i mean , today , singapore is a first world country and ghana is not .
we want peace . &quot;
ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently .
they changed the government , and it didn &apos;t work .
like he did one with -- he had a little wheel , like a fan , that was sort of loosely attached , so it could spin by itself .
candles can &apos;t burn in a vacuum , therefore , probably sparklers wouldn &apos;t either .
kary mullis : they might have done it for the teddy bear , yeah .
that &apos;s why i thought , as long as i don &apos;t blow my eyes out ...
and we had not -- we should have been , because it made a lot of smoke and it made a lot of noise , and it was powerful , you know .
ok . all scientists aren &apos;t like that .
and so he came up with this theory , and he said , this will be cool , because it &apos;ll be a longer growing season in sweden , you know , and the surfers liked it , the surfers thought , that &apos;s a cool idea , because it &apos;s pretty cold in the ocean sometimes , and -- but a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad , you know .
they &apos;re concerned , and you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers , because they &apos;re talking about big laboratories that are funded by lots of money and by scared people .
what we saw very quickly is the world of both medical research , but also developing drugs and treatments , is dominated by , as you would expect , large organizations , but in a new field , sometimes large organizations really have trouble getting out of their own way , and sometimes they can &apos;t ask the right questions , and there is an enormous gap that &apos;s just gotten larger between academic research on the one hand and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs and many of our treatments , and so we knew that to really accelerate cures and therapies , we were going to have to address this with two things : new technologies and also a new research model .
so the way we develop drugs now is by testing promising compounds on -- we didn &apos;t have disease modeling with human cells , so we &apos;d been testing them on cells of mice or other creatures or cells that we engineer , but they don &apos;t have the characteristics of the diseases that we &apos;re actually trying to cure .
it has massively parallel processing capability , and it &apos;s going to change the way drugs are discovered , we hope , and i think eventually what &apos;s going to happen on arrays like this , that already exist , all of the drugs that currently exist , and in the future , you &apos;re going to be taking drugs and treatments that have been tested for side effects on all of the relevant cells , on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells .
i &apos;ll follow the rats . &quot;
instead of looking at reproductions of it at home , you &apos;re actually feeling the hand-laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight .
this is the new york city farm colony , which was a poorhouse in staten island from the 1890s to the 1930s .
this is a german bunker .
i like doing more than just exploring these spaces .
now , i guarantee that about 85 percent of you , or maybe it &apos;s fewer at ted , will have said it comes out of the ground . and some people , probably two of you , will come up and argue with me afterwards , and say that actually , it comes out of the ground .
by extension , we think to ourselves , &quot; why it &apos;s hotter in summer than in winter must be because we &apos;re closer to the sun . &quot;
we do this , of course , with matters of race , and politics , and everything else , and we do it in science as well . so we look , just look -- and scientists do it , constantly -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models , and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models .
and the second question to that then is , ensure you &apos;ve explained how it is that planes can fly upside down .
and when i talk about darwinian evolution , i mean one thing and one thing only , and that is survival of the fittest .
so i was positive that , if somehow we can make things mimic life , let &apos;s go one step further .
and the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing .
but there &apos;s a roadblock that you can &apos;t get past .
i say , &quot; well i want molecules . &quot;
and that is the key .
and the profound realization for me is that , if this works , the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level , and we really start talking about selfish matter .
in your own mind , what do you believe the chances are that walking around on some other planet is non-carbon-based life , walking or oozing or something ?
i bring you to the webpage , childmortality.org , where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries -- it &apos;s done by u.n. specialists .
have got these surveys in place in their database , then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line , and the trend line looks like this .
so what i &apos;m telling you is that we know the child mortality .
and i &apos;m now giving you a wider picture than the mdg .
and here we got better education , and we got health service , and child mortality came down .
we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill .
there we are today .
that is , when we get girls in school , we &apos;ll get an impact 15 to 20 years later , which is a secular trend which is very strong .
and if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start riding on scooters .
and you can see the cartoon here .
there was a co-creation , a huge co-creation , with vendors and suppliers .
he has bought his own nano .
and that is how jaipur foot was created in india .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
he is giving us not just for psoriasis , for cancer and a whole range of things , changing the whole paradigm .
and incubator costs 2,000 dollars .
one day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens .
i &apos;m trying to build a global team , which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing .
i &apos;m fortunate enough to be part of one .
but that &apos;s a ton of power .
their burn-up is much higher .
but i think i get to come back to this , because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket that produces 50 to 100 megawatts .
commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy that lasted for millennia .
now , over the last several years i spent a lot of time in europe , and particularly in the netherlands , and whenever i talk about the experience economy there , i &apos;m always greeted at the end with one particular question , almost invariably .
becoming the basis of the economy .
and i don &apos;t know about you , but whenever i encounter two dimensions , i immediately go , ahh , two-by-two !
disney world , on the other hand , is a fake real , or a fake reality .
think about any hotel , any airline , any hospital .
joseph pine : what consumers want
now , this kind of machine is as close as i can get to painting .
and that &apos;s the whole piece .
and then , i got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of erotic art , and i didn &apos;t have any pieces .
it would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner .
i was offered a position as associate professor of medicine and chief of scientific visualization at yale university in the department of medicine .
and as we kept on scanning more and more , working on this project , looking at these two simple cells that have this kind of unbelievable machinery that will become the magic of you .
and it &apos;s not just our own existence , but how does the woman &apos;s body understand to have genetic structure that not only builds her own , but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking immunological , cardiovascular system that basically is a mobile system that can actually nurture , treat this child with a kind of marvel that is beyond , again , our comprehension -- the magic that is existence , that is us ?
so if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids , you will have this lithium-6 isotope in the spectrum of the star .
in the core , we have thermonuclear reactions going on , creating chemical elements .
this was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions .
and this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source .
it &apos;s very tough . it &apos;s very tough .
if you suddenly observe technetium in a sun-like star , you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere , because in a natural way it is impossible to do this .
and she said , &quot; but the thing i liked about your talk is you &apos;re a storyteller .
and i &apos;m like , knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all a &apos;s .
what underpinned this shame , this &quot; i &apos;m not good enough , &quot; -- which we all know that feeling : &quot; i &apos;m not blank enough . i &apos;m not thin enough , rich enough , beautiful enough , smart enough , promoted enough . &quot;
and the first words that came to my mind were whole-hearted .
a spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown , but i assure you it was a breakdown .
so she goes like this .
and one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability .
the more afraid we are , the more vulnerable we are , the more afraid we are .
we &apos;ll fix it . &quot;
now , we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle -- the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices , the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing , and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors .
here &apos;s a biometric device : a pair of apple earbuds .
now we believe that drones have tremendous potential , not only for combating wildlife crime , but also for monitoring the health of these wildlife populations .
and this is it ; this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone .
building drones for us is a constant work in progress .
and we believe , strongly believe , that drones can and will be a game changer for conservation research and applications .
&quot; given my status , what is the best outcome i can hope to achieve , and how do i get there ? &quot;
we did this for als . we can do this for depression , parkinson &apos;s disease , hiv .
this amazing data allows us to drill down and see what this drug is for -- 1,500 people on this drug , i think . yes .
i don &apos;t want to just look at this cool device , i want to take this data and make something even better .
but the short story is : if you &apos;re a patient , you want to be on the blue line .
and you take those data , and we find the patients like him , and we bring their data together . and we bring their histories into it .
we asked our control algorithm , are those 69 patients -- by the way , you &apos;ll notice that &apos;s four times the number of patients in the clinical trial -- can we look at those patients and say , &quot; can we match them with our time machine to the other patients that are just like them , and what happens ? &quot;
and , you know , i look at this , and i get really emotional .
and yet i think it &apos;s this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions .
and when it &apos;s in this form , if i combine it with a polymer and affix it to your window when it &apos;s in its colored state , it will reflect away all heat and light , and when it &apos;s in its bleached state it will let all the light and heat through and any combination in between .
knowing that we &apos;re not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power , we went to a group at university of texas at dallas , and we gave them this diagram .
i &apos;ve carried this photograph with me every day since then .
&quot; we spend billions of dollars trying to understand the origins of the universe while we still don &apos;t understand the conditions for a stable society , a functioning economy , or peace . &quot;
so the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
and what is the overall distribution of control ?
about 10 years ago , mr. tronchetti provera had ownership and control in a small company , which had ownership and control in a bigger company .
and this is slowly starting .
take piping .
in three dimensions , we did a project last year at tedglobal with autodesk and arthur olson where we looked at autonomous parts -- so individual parts not pre-connected that can come together on their own .
a single strand dipped in water that completely self-folds on its own into the letters m i t .
thank you .
a bad sort of branding thing , or whatever .
so i kind of switched . i went to mit , finished .
they were saying , make it stop now .
i have behind this wall a disk drive , a cpu , a graphics card , a memory system .
i remember , like , we &apos;d be in his studio , like , at 2 a.m. , and then he &apos;d show up from some client meeting .
so , i began to make things again . this is another series of objects made of old computers from my basement .
in this strange moment where , like , these things kind of appeared .
risd alums ? yeah , risd . there we go , risd . woo , risd .
the hundred girls project tells us some really nice statistics .
video games are a symptom .
&quot; all right . well , what do you want to write ? what do you want to write about ? &quot;
are there men around that table ?
we need to put ourselves into boy culture .
they say , &quot; oh , yeah . they &apos;re always talking about that stuff .
the higgs boson does not share the beauty , the symmetry , the elegance , of the rest of the elementary particle world .
this is because , according to the laws of quantum mechanics , it is possible to have transitions between two states , even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states , and the phenomenon is called , quite appropriately , quantum tunneling .
so according to these calculations , we are like campers who accidentally set their tent at the edge of a cliff .
in the majority of bubble universes , the higgs mass could be around the critical value , near to a cosmic collapse of the higgs field , because of two competing effects , just as in the case of sand .
it &apos;s more that i just liked the idea of an everyday object having something inside and doing something different .
and i was told that i wouldn &apos;t be able to do this , which , you know , as we &apos;ve heard from other people , that &apos;s the thing that makes you do it .
you can hear a press conference as well as reading what the editor has determined that press conference was about .
i &apos;m not a d.j. , though , but i just always wanted to do that .
so this was really interesting to me , this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life , and also adding interactivity to sculpture .
but we haven &apos;t yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really , truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we &apos;re comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that , i don &apos;t know about you , but i really enjoy spending time in .
we have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car .
so despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary , we really focused on doing as little new as possible .
it also continues to be a fabulous adventure .
they seem fantastic to me . they cost very little to develop .
it was an absolute masterpiece .
not so in italy .
however , what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value , and it &apos;s much fairer .
he believes the mobile phone , by being location-specific , contextual , timely and immediate , is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented .
so , shreddies is actually producing a new product , which is something very exciting for them .
they give badge value to everyday little trivial activities .
so i went back to my college and became a typical japanese worker as a systems engineer .
darwin had this amazing idea .
there &apos;s one word i love on that slide .
and he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes , and so he said , &quot; is there another replicator out there on the planet ? &quot;
and what about , oh , i can &apos;t see any interesting memes here .
this has spread all over the world .
copying with variation and selection .
and we &apos;re getting there .
the fraction of those that get the third replicator .
why ? because it &apos;s producing the memes .
we make new ones , and so it &apos;s convenient to piggyback on us , because we &apos;re not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable .
this is the national palace -- the equivalent of the white house .
the proof of this came in chile , almost a month later , when 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit chile .
the way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail .
so that &apos;s what i did .
and here &apos;s how it went .
some people shredded everything , went out of the room , and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars .
as you can expect it doesn &apos;t last very long ; people take it .
they cheat just by a little bit , all the same .
we &apos;ve learned that a lot of people can cheat .
creating so much torture was not something that was good for me , too . &quot;
and now you know why i &apos;m fun at parties .
a reproductive system that fails to function produces an individual that has no offspring , and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool .
because he was afraid i was walking into a trap .
the arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton .
diane kelly : what we didn &apos;t know about penis anatomy
we had a television for a few years , but of course we wasted so much time and the work wasn &apos;t getting done , so out went the television .
i &apos;ll quickly play a short part of the air , and then i &apos;m going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you &apos;re not warmed up , so , if i mess it up , pretend you like it anyway . it &apos;s called the banks .
it became the only piano in the region , and mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived , she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms . anyway , we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back home . we purchased it .
he never went back to school .
so noam and i had this insight that if we want our students to understand how computers work , and understand it in the marrow of their bones , then perhaps the best way to go about it is to have them build a complete , working , general-purpose , useful computer , hardware and software , from the ground up , from first principles .
for example , take dan rounds , who is a music and math major from east lansing , michigan .
now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure , so a six-year-old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram .
i was forced to leave the democratic republic of the congo , my home , where i was a student activist .
the state-regulated mining industry has collapsed , and control over mines has splintered .
we need to continue mounting pressure on phone companies to change their sourcing processes .
if you could get two extra workers for 90 minutes to start in an hour &apos;s time , you &apos;d do it , but they &apos;d have to be reliable , inducted in how your cafe works .
and they &apos;re looking at how many of the people they &apos;ve inducted are available each hour next week .
and when a wall street trader comes into work in the morning , she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today and then post that listing on multiple websites and wait for potential buyers to get in touch and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade .
i believe we could .
so we &apos;re talking about sectors like home hair care , the hire of toys , farm work , hire of clothes even , meals delivered to your door , services for tourists , home care .
he has been orphaned , as both of his parents died of aids , and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of aids .
it &apos;s really been a long time since we &apos;ve known about fusion .
because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon-free energy .
you get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together .
and with current reactor technology we really don &apos;t have very much uranium .
and in 2013 we &apos;re going to fire it up again and break all those records .
steven cowley : fusion is energy &apos;s future
and that &apos;s because they have better job opportunities and their state offers better social services .
evaluating egypt on this basis alone , however , ignores the real revolution .
and that is egyptians &apos; elevated expectations are placed first on themselves .
thank you .
&quot; i don &apos;t want to go to school today .
and so they started following and watching petty thefts , summonses , all kinds of things -- charting the future essentially .
if you really ask yourself this question , you can &apos;t help but feel uncomfortable .
and on that first flight we got more data than in all u-2 missions combined .
but we collected more hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of ground-based testing combined .
we cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things -- like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain , or maybe even ice ; a robot that can run like a cheetah , or climb stairs like a human with the occasional clumsiness of a human .
and it is the first time that tim has held katie &apos;s hand in seven years .
they challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions .
and on one particularly dark day for me , jason sat down and he wrote an email .
now the purpose of the vehicle though , the purpose of the technology , is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes .
i mean , do you worry about the pandora &apos;s box issue here ?
a few years ago , my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry .
so let &apos;s not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse .
and yet , we began to talk about it , and one thing led to another .
at the beginning , it was a disaster .
and it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was misplaced , and that there was another vision supremely more important and more readily available .
and you look down at yokneam ; everything is so small and tiny .
in every one of these rides i always end up standing in one of these incredible locations , taking in this incredible landscape around me , and i feel blessed and fortunate that i &apos;m alive , and that i sense every fiber in my aching body .
the self changed , got affected , broken , destroyed , but another one would evolve -- sometimes stronger , sometimes hateful , sometimes not wanting to be there at all .
that nagging dread of self-hood didn &apos;t exist when i was dancing .
but what was credible , what is biological and scientific fact , is that we all stem from africa -- in fact , from a woman called mitochondrial eve who lived 160,000 years ago .
and i honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure .
we knew it from the day we were born .
and this is a window display .
and so this is in paddington in london .
so we were looking at how we could make a power station , that , instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside , could be a place that pulls you in .
and the world &apos;s first major botanical institution is in london , and they have this extraordinary project where they &apos;ve been collecting 25 percent of all the world &apos;s plant species .
and by night , artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside .
and the mayor of kuala lumpur said that , if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city , they would give them more gross floor area , buildable .
thank you , thomas .
and here &apos;s what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their dna -- namely , clones or identical twins .
in the book , i go over controversies such as this one , and a number of other hot buttons , hot zones , chernobyls , third rails , and so on -- including the arts , cloning , crime , free will , education , evolution , gender differences , god , homosexuality , infanticide , inequality , marxism , morality , nazism , parenting , politics , race , rape , religion , resource depletion , social engineering , technological risk and war .
the telling of stories , music , dance , poetry -- found in all cultures , and many of the motifs and themes that give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies : a preference for symmetrical forms , the use of repetition and variation , even things as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world , you have lines that are very close to three seconds long , separated by pauses .
the beauty and pleasure in art -- probably a human universal -- were -- began to be considered saccharine , or kitsch , or commercial .
well , here &apos;s some sobering facts about parenting .
the &quot; dirty jobs &quot; crew and i were called to a little town in colorado , called craig .
and i &apos;m given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built , and we go about the business of animal husbandry .
we don &apos;t fool around , we don &apos;t rehearse -- we shoot what we get !
i said , &quot; a day ! how long does it take them to fall off ? &quot;
and i can &apos;t get this thought out of my head , and i can &apos;t get that vision out of my sight , so i did what i had to do .
&quot; oh , i &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; -- that &apos;s weird .
they &apos;ve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life .
safety -- safety first ?
i could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that i got it wrong .
good grief , not to this crowd .
it &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
and i said , &quot; who &apos;s tony ? &quot;
and he had his arm outstretched like someone out of the apprentice .
tony said that it &apos;s a lot harder to convince people you &apos;re sane than it is to convince them you &apos;re crazy .
speaks to items one and two on the checklist -- glibness , superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth .
i emailed &quot; chainsaw al &quot; dunlap , the asset stripper from the 1990s .
and he looked intrigued despite himself , and he said , &quot; okay , go on . &quot;
and this is a country that over-diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely .
he was living with a girl outside london .
after 9 / 11 , the tables were turned .
some people say that democracy consists basically in elections .
noah feldman : politics and religion are technologies
we have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing , but completely inexperienced , volunteers .
and you may notice they &apos;re wearing very thick gloves .
and when you clean a penguin , you first have to spray it with a degreaser .
just look at that 17 year-old .
we tried to answer this simple question : can you find a unifying language that cuts across age and income and culture that will help people themselves find a new way of living , see spaces around them differently , think about the resources they use differently , interact differently ?
this is about us going to the people and saying , &quot; we are all part of the local food jigsaw , we are all part of a solution . &quot;
this is a movement for everyone .
and i &apos;m also rather surprised , because when i look back on my life the last thing i ever wanted to do was write , or be in any way involved in religion .
what i &apos;ve found , across the board , is that religion is about behaving differently .
but now look at our world . and we are living in a world that is -- where religion has been hijacked . where terrorists cite quranic verses to justify their atrocities .
because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn &apos;t promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time .
it &apos;s what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies , and beginning to appreciate the other .
and as we go smaller again , about ten times smaller than that , is a cell .
you have things like coral .
and many of the grains of sand on the moon look like that , and you &apos;d never find that on earth .
and the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning x-ray , which is the sort of machine you have on borders , which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things .
but i quite love the way it &apos;s posed .
you can see them overlapping .
it makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional .
because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves .
unfortunately i haven &apos;t got x-ray vision .
it &apos;s about science , it &apos;s about rationalism .
if you ever think that your life is rubbish , always remember there &apos;s another you that &apos;s made much worse decisions than that .
if someone punches me -- and because of my personality , this is recently a regular occurrence -- i understand where the pain comes from .
i stopped observing the house for a moment , and when i started observing again , everything had happened . &quot;
you , i imagine , can do much better things with your time .
what is that idea ?
so when he gives me his final paper , in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure , i say , &quot; i don &apos;t know .
and two of the things about bengal : they like their savory dishes and they like their sweets .
we moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information .
which brings me to the final element of this .
so his daddy is president for life of equatorial guinea , a west african nation that has exported billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s and yet has a truly appalling human rights record .
but it wasn &apos;t about blood diamonds .
well , because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years .
corruption in that sector , no surprise .
two thirds of the value of the world &apos;s oil and mining companies are now covered by transparency laws . two thirds .
you can &apos;t travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle .
ideas get shorter . they become sound bytes .
i want to talk about a few of these people that i &apos;ve met .
she made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard , but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls .
and then i suddenly realized that it absolutely didn &apos;t matter where i was going , or where i had come from because we are all essentially permanently displaced people .
i &apos;m used to a stationary mic .
now , the first day of my graphic design training at penn state university , the teacher , lanny sommese , came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard , and wrote the word &quot; apple &quot; underneath , and he said , &quot; ok . lesson one . listen up . &quot;
everybody in house loved it , and so off it goes to the author .
augusten burroughs wrote a memoir called &#91; &quot; dry &quot; &#93; , and it &apos;s about his time in rehab .
ahh ! we come upon them , the clandestine lovers . let &apos;s draw them out .
it &apos;s one part of the form and content .
so , as you can see evidenced by such examples , age has absolutely nothing to do with it .
if i doubt my older sister &apos;s ability to pay back the 10 percent interest i established on her last loan , i &apos;m going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back .
no matter your position or place in life , it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away .
there was a time when i considered wild soundscapes to be a worthless artifact .
you can see that the stream is still represented in the bottom third of the page , but notice what &apos;s missing in the top two thirds .
a colleague of mine was recording in the american midwest around this pond that had been formed maybe 16,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age .
so i actually went to school in belfast , which was where all the action happened .
you had this same thing in america , it was called the timex sinclair1000 .
last year was the biggest year .
i dove onto ebay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on , typed in world of warcraft , got 6,000 items .
this is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today .
i &apos;m addicted , because even though i know i &apos;m losing my grip on reality , i still crave more .
i know what i want and i do it .
video games are fun , engaging , and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re-programming .
that means there &apos;s literally thousands of new ideas .
david perry . that was awesome .
we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel .
so , another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle .
well , that &apos;s pretty amazing .
we &apos;re going to move the car according to that over and over again .
so when the children see this , they say , &quot; ah ! acceleration , &quot; remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways , and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is .
alan kay : a powerful ideas about ideas
and you know , i &apos;m getting a little bit gray -- so is ray kurzweil , so is eric drexler .
it &apos;s going to probably change the human lifespan .
and it is really not suited for the future that we &apos;re moving into .
there are three obvious ways of doing this .
but when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world , which is going to be the case with these technologies , when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial , which is already the case , and when they &apos;re almost impossible to police , it &apos;s not a question of if this is going to happen , it &apos;s when and where and how it &apos;s going to happen .
this is the flowering of human endeavor . &quot;
and then what comes out of it ? new life .
i have a daughter , mulan .
and i said , &quot; well , men , through their penis , they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out .
that &apos;s exactly how it happens . &quot;
and then i realized that i had taken my little eight year old &apos;s hand , and taken her right into internet porn .
and it would remain stable and operate quite happily .
john pepper , bless his heart , professor of cardiothoracic surgery -- never done it before in his life -- he put the first one in , didn &apos;t like it , took it out , put the second one in .
raad mohiaddin , medical radiologist : we had to get good quality images from which to make the cad model .
there were people on the research and ethics committee because he &apos;s so successful .
we &apos;ve got 90 post-op patient years between us , and we haven &apos;t had a single problem .
if you have any questions , please come up and talk to me later on .
every village in africa now has a cyber cafe .
in short , technology , the internet , they have changed our lifestyle .
in 2006 , a few months after , i went ivory coast -- western africa .
&quot; another time . &quot;
for three days , almost all the newspapers of beirut published all those cartoonists together -- anti-government , pro-government , christian , muslim , of course , english-speaking , well , you name it .
just to make it a little bit more exciting .
it was , &quot; it burns ! it burns ! &quot;
and that &apos;s the fate of a planet , too .
and every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large-body impact .
there was big stuff back then .
so , i really suspect there &apos;s an alternative , and that life does actually try to do itself in -- not consciously , but just because it does .
so , these are new data rob berner and i -- from yale -- put together , and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record -- and we can do this from a variety of means -- and put all the red lines here , when these -- what i call greenhouse mass extinctions -- took place .
and the reason i could do that is because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events , and our bodies have adapted .
the new view of mass extinctions is , yes , we were hit , and , yes , we have to think about the long term , because we will get hit again .
one man died after working a 36-hour shift .
now , i didn &apos;t come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain .
this is offshore .
so they formed a white house task force , and they spent about three years arguing about who takes how much responsibility in the global supply chain .
those supply chains i put up on the screen earlier , they &apos;re not there .
i hate the idea that governments are not protecting human rights around the world .
the example , the role model , is there .
and she &apos;s going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face , wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach .
remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things .
and sometimes i get to the end of the poem and look back and go , &quot; oh , that &apos;s what this is all about , &quot; and sometimes i get to the end of the poem and haven &apos;t solved anything , but at least i have a new poem out of it .
i love spoken word . i will keep coming back week after week . &quot;
but one of my students , a freshman named charlotte , was not convinced .
plus , spoken word poetry allows for immediate connections .
when they bombed hiroshima , the explosion formed a mini-supernova so every living animal , human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash .
but in that instant , i get to share your present .
it can give credit to sound decision-making , adding momentum to success .
an anti-sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as commander zero attacked a town in southern nicaragua .
farmers were driven off their land , and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen .
the image reminded me of a cave painting , and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways .
the active ingredient was dioxin , an extremely toxic chemical that was sprayed in vast quantities , and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation .
i &apos;d been photographing in the islamic world since 1981 -- not only in the middle east , but also in africa , asia and europe .
photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience to show people what &apos;s going on .
they &apos;re unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted .
so you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote .
it &apos;s when the young couple whisper , &quot; tonight we are going to make a baby . &quot;
it &apos;s eastern religion in india and china and neighboring asian countries .
now 1962 -- can you see they &apos;re getting a little richer , but the number of babies per woman is falling ?
because the death of a child is compensated by one more child .
well i do as i always do .
each card box is one billion people .
and we will be just 10 billion in this world , if the poorest people get out of poverty , their children survive , they get access to family planning .
this is us at the khyber pass , and that &apos;s our bus .
day seven , they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication .
so , how we eradicated smallpox was -- max vaccination wouldn &apos;t work .
i feel like hank aaron . barry bonds can replace me any time .
the moment who says we &apos;ve moved to category four , this will not be like katrina . the world as we know it will stop .
what we really want is to arrive right here , so we can stop the epidemic .
let &apos;s make it transparent , non-governmental , not owned by any single country or company , housed in a neutral country , with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent , and let &apos;s build it on gphin . let &apos;s start with gphin .
now , here &apos;s what &apos;s real interesting , after they &apos;d been working for a couple years , what do you think happened to those nations ?
the third number is 12 : that &apos;s the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born .
today we have choices .
let &apos;s take cotton .
some things are certain , i think .
you know the phrase , you can manage what you measure ?
the big blue buildings of ikea have sprouted solar panels and wind turbines ; inside , shelves are stocked with led lighting and recycled cotton . why ? because as steve howard puts it : &quot; sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do . &quot; howard , the chief sustainability officer at the furniture megastore , talks about his quest to sell eco-friendly materials and practices -- both internally and to worldwide customers -- and lays a challenge for other global giants .
she &apos;s concerned about what &apos;s happening in this world right now .
i &apos;m calling my initiative , &quot; take the other to lunch . &quot;
&quot; what ? &quot; she wanted to know .
during the process of making these films i found myself taking photographs , often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen .
this woman witnessed the general murdering her brother .
liberia has been devastated by one of africa &apos;s bloodiest civil wars , which has left more than 200,000 people dead , thousands of women scarred by rape and crime on a spectacular scale .
these men were terrified , as the mob attacked our vehicle .
focus on what &apos;s dignified , courageous and beautiful , and it grows . thank you .
he was a soft dictator of kenya .
all right , we just engaged all eight individuals .
i mean , if you did receive thousands of u.s. embassy diplomatic cables ...
but remember , the people in baghdad , the people in iraq , the people in afghanistan -- they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
so late last year -- in november last year -- there was a series of well blowouts in albania , like the well blowout in the gulf of mexico , but not quite as big .
so that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
j yeah . and you know , i &apos;m a combative person , so i &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way -- there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
well , it looks like i &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , julian , be careful , and all power to you .
what i come up with are forms like these .
thank you .
i thought this would be easy , but i emailed about 200 different people within a five-hour radius of where i lived , and i got one positive response that said that they could work with me .
and i want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant .
in fact , it &apos;s one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today .
and the economic burden of asthma exceeds that of hiv and tuberculosis combined .
in the blue bar at the bottom of the graph , it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate , what her exhalation rate or lung health , should be based on her age , gender and height .
they only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way , and maybe censors that natural curiosity , or you know , reins in the question-asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids .
so that we can stop compartmentalizing form , function and aesthetic , and assigning them different values .
i learned this firsthand with my next adventure .
it is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency .
so i guess both susan boyle and this vegetable vendor in shanghai belonged to otherness .
well after a few years , i decided to go to the u.s. and columbia university to pursue my postgraduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was unthought of during the years that i started my career .
and also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog .
and for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest .
and after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
you might think that it &apos;s quite hard to find new stories and new subjects , but new technology is changing the way we can film .
and eventually we got lucky .
and one remote location -- i first went there as a backpacker ; i &apos;ve been back several times for filming , most recently for untamed americas -- it &apos;s the altiplano in the high andes of south america , and it &apos;s the most otherworldly place i know .
&quot; these talking machines are going to ruin artistic development of music in this country .
and so they appealed to lord blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing .
taking the songs of the day and the old songs and remixing them to make them something different .
these tools of creativity have become tools of speech .
and second , we need the businesses that are building out this read-write culture to embrace this opportunity expressly , to enable it , so that this ecology of free content , or freer content , can grow on a neutral platform where they both exist simultaneously , so that more-free can compete with less-free , and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition can teach one the lessons of the other .
i &apos;m supposed to scare you , because it &apos;s about fear , right ?
so , all you guys have heard about dna , all the stuff that dna does , but some of the stuff we &apos;re discovering is kind of nifty because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet .
this is a really odd one . this is ferroplasma .
huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields .
why would cliff be doing that ? he doesn &apos;t have a restaurant .
that &apos;s what your genes are doing every day .
well , it turns out that there &apos;s about 27 trillion bits moving inside from the united states to the united states ; about 4.6 trillion is going over to those european countries ; about 5.5 &apos;s going to japan ; there &apos;s almost no communication between japan , and nobody else is literate in this stuff .
and it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s , the most productive nation on earth was australia , per person .
people are taking control of their own states , sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse .
jakob trollback : a new kind of music video
we say , &quot; nice song . &quot;
on a given day , studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times .
lying has evolutionary value to us as a species .
bill clinton : i want you to listen to me .
because we think liars fidget all the time .
now let &apos;s say you &apos;re having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive .
now with anger , you &apos;ve got two people on an even playing field .
and as i promised , we &apos;re now going to look at what the truth looks like .
they know , as someone once said , &quot; character &apos;s who you are in the dark . &quot;
it &apos;s really amazing .
he says , &quot; when the sumerian tablets were first translated , they were thought to be business records .
the first time the possibility for independence was discussed was in 1922 , following the aba women &apos;s market riots .
so what he did was to teach us jewish holocaust history , and so huddled around books with photographs of people in auschwitz , i learned the melancholic history of my people through the melancholic history of another people .
and fraser &apos;s on his knees , arms tied behind his back , and he &apos;s crying .
as a young middle-class nigerian activist , i launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government .
the fact that it happens in &quot; another country &quot; takes you quite by surprise .
in this deeply personal talk , nigerian writer chris abani says that &quot; what we know about how to be who we are &quot; comes from stories . he searches for the heart of africa through its poems and narrative , including his own .
so let &apos;s start with the data .
they set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers , and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people , who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product .
ultimately , coke &apos;s success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a coca-cola .
and i think that &apos;s a mistake .
we know that circumcision reduces hiv infection by 60 percent in men .
well on september 4th , there was a huge mop-up campaign , which is what you do in polio .
this is my baseline : this is the mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .
and many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline .
if we don &apos;t have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness , this is great .
after a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the urchins , and then the algae grow again .
you can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up .
if this is so good , if this is such a no-brainer , how much of this do we have ?
ngos and governments spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas , usually .
they reproduce very slowly ; they have a slow metabolism ; and , basically , they just maintain their biomass .
es : it is a spiritual experience .
it &apos;s mostly unexplored , and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it .
dg : this is one of them , another one of our favorites , because it &apos;s a little octopod .
we &apos;re getting down further and further in scale .
not only is it coming out of the earth -- so , biogenesis made from volcanic activity -- but that bacteria supports these colonies of life .
on one of the last dive series , we counted 200 species in these areas -- 198 were new , new species .
it &apos;s how they find the hydrothermal vents .
here &apos;s a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm , waiting for that worm to stick his head out .
learn to manage it .
so first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
and the textbook , i think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
but if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how i made your stuff better , &quot; which , wow .
and so if you ask this question : where would you look to see the future of education ?
he was turning over 200,000 dollars a week .
it &apos;s the mobile phone .
this is a school three hours outside of sao paulo .
in the schools and communities that taio works in , the day always starts in a circle and always starts from a question .
so the trendiest schools in the world , high tech high and others , they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity .
they know what to expect , even though it &apos;ll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different .
they &apos;re recognizably schools , but they look different .
but it will also lay waste to imagination .
when i finally got to a place in my life where i came out and accepted who i was , and was really quite happy , to tell you the truth , i was happily gay and i guess that &apos;s supposed to be right because gay means happy too .
this is the super duper evil gay lifestyle .
it &apos;s very , very frustrating , and i was feeling left out , like i wasn &apos;t quite gay enough .
specifically , this little amendment right here : &quot; no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter what i &apos;ve already proven , what i can do with my heart .
a few energy geeks spread out across the room .
but there was a fourth message , and this message simply said , &quot; when surveyed , 77 percent of your neighbors said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans .
that &apos;s 40 billion -- with a b -- every year in the u.s. alone .
we did everything that letter told us to do , and still i know there must be more .
age not at all as pathology ; age as potential .
we &apos;re going to discuss what we can do to make these added years really successful and use them to make a difference .
and so we can feel unfinished .
what determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities , what kind of meaning we assign them , what kind of attitude we cling to about them , what state of mind we allow them to trigger . &quot;
they &apos;re really difficult for plants to produce .
plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way .
and this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles .
i photographed this thing last week in dorset .
so what is an insect seeing ?
maybe you &apos;re ticked off , or maybe you &apos;re looking forward to a new game . you &apos;ve been up too late playing a game .
it absolutely means something more .
so the ships start in england , they come down from england , they go to africa , they go across the ocean -- that &apos;s the middle passage part — they come to america where the slaves are sold , she &apos;s telling me .
and she was fascinated by this , and she started to cry , and i started to cry , and her father started to cry , and now we &apos;re all crying . he didn &apos;t expect to come home from work to the middle passage , but there it goes .
and so to me , this beautiful culture , this beautiful expression is something that i want to capture through games .
you can see this is a major shipping airport , and there &apos;s all kinds of activity there .
and then you &apos;re going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the night before , which happens right here .
i took the first 10,000 sheep that i collected , and i put them on a website called thesheepmarket.com where you can actually buy collections of 20 sheep .
it &apos;s about your own interpretation and doing something different . &quot;
this is max mathews and john kelly from bell labs in the &apos; 60s , where they created the song &quot; daisy bell , &quot; which was the world &apos;s first singing computer .
we made a music video for one of my favorite bands , radiohead .
collaborator two : it really allows this last recording of his to be a living , breathing memorial .
and this is called &quot; the wilderness downtown . &quot;
as a teenager , i was sketching , drawing , and i wanted to be an artist .
so as you can guess , my mother tongue is french .
it would be so light .
&quot; daily battles . &quot;
that &apos;s the border .
after eight years of rejection , i was thrilled to get my first commission with the percent for art in new york city .
you can also have function and form with public art .
they have a lot of scenarios .
that is snobbery .
there are no strictly defined kind of hierarchies .
everybody , all politicians on left and right , agree that meritocracy is a great thing , and we should all be trying to make our societies really , really meritocratic .
we will never get to grade them , never get to grade people as they should .
i went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of western art .
it &apos;s an escape from our own competition , and our own dramas .
so what i want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success , but we should make sure that they are our own .
we need fathers , as it were , the exemplary father figures in society , avoiding the two extremes , which is the authoritarian , disciplinarian , on the one hand , and on the other , the lax , no rules option .
and i had kept in good shape , but swimming &apos;s a whole different animal .
and a month ago , the 23rd of september , i stood on that shore and i looked across to that long , long faraway horizon and i asked myself , do you have it ?
and we knew it , all 50 people on the boat , we all knew this was it , this was our time .
they drag him out on the boat , and he &apos;s -- evidently , i didn &apos;t see any of this -- but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots and crying out .
and the dream was crushed .
he said , &quot; that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about . that &apos;s what you need . &quot;
thank you .
you check your email while you &apos;re sitting here .
this is now a little tiny patch .
and this wired magazine cover article really captured a lot of this ; it talked a lot about the nike shoe and how quickly that &apos;s been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and energy expenditure .
it monitors your brainwaves continuously , when you &apos;re sleeping .
almost 24 million people have diabetes .
there &apos;s over 650 wireless companies , 100 of which or more are working in wireless health .
if you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard , and you say , &quot; well , what about thinking and emotions ? &quot;
or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it .
well , what are we going to do about that ? we could get smarter .
nobody knows how most of them work in detail , but we do know that there &apos;re lots of different things in there .
and it &apos;s largely what you would find in these books .
because with that beautiful photo , maybe i can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time .
buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference .
one of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way .
you know , there &apos;s two ways you can make a product .
now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that &apos;s why you shouldn &apos;t get shot .
now we &apos;ve got the dawn of interventional surgery here .
with the demonstration of the morton ether inhaler at the mass . general in 1847 , a whole new era of surgery was ushered in .
some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years , but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the 1980s , when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that , that allowed this to be done for real operations .
the surgeon is sitting at a console , and controlling the robot with these controllers .
and for that reason there are many surgeries that just aren &apos;t being done with the da vinci .
we need to see beyond the surface .
and that is not the case .
mw : however , plastics are useful because they &apos;re durable , flexible , and can be easily molded into so many useful shapes .
to make the matter worse , phthalates are found in products to which we have a high exposure , such as babies &apos; toys , beverage containers , cosmetics , and even food wraps .
so jeanny and i took three of our most efficient strains and then performed gene amplification sequencing on them and matched our data with an online comprehensive database .
charles and ray were a team . they were husband and wife .
eames demetrios : now , this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the united states .
these are all the prototypes . these are the mistakes , although i don &apos;t think mistakes is the right word in design .
and i was very touched by dean kamen &apos;s work for the military , or for the soldiers , because charles and ray designed a molded plywood splint . this is it .
the familiar one on the lower right .
upper left is a film they did on toy trains .
so you guys did pretty good , cool .
and you &apos;re kind of trapped in the texture of kymaerica .
and i &apos;ve shown you some of the images . i just want to focus on sound now .
all that great thinking needs to really get about solving pretty key problems .
i &apos;m talking about real slavery .
they come into slavery because someone has asked them this question .
d : michael , what &apos;s your take on the people story ? are you interested ?
they are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder .
well , amazingly , in places like india where costs are very low , that family , that three-generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery -- so , that granddad there , was born a baby into slavery -- but the total cost , amortized across the rest of the work , was about 150 dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education .
they had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery .
the first is zero electrical resistance , and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor .
like this , or move it slightly to the right or to the left .
this two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms , a small car , in my hand .
unfortunately , when i got there -- emerges ray .
so many such that it &apos;s now just a home for bacteria who really like acidic , toxic conditions .
and they &apos;re at the sharp end of what &apos;s called the weee , which is this european electrical and electronic waste directive .
if i take 30 steps exponentially -- two , four , eight , 16 -- i get to a billion .
the great depression made not a dent in this exponential progression .
the cost has come down by half every year .
and there is 10 thousand times more sunlight than we need .
so we &apos;re very appreciative of the support we &apos;ve gotten from both the intellectual leaders , the high-tech leaders , particularly google and nasa .
a boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house to get his dog , who was apparently afraid .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming in . it &apos;s coming again .
the yale law professor yochai benkler , in an essay called &quot; coase &apos;s penguin , &quot; talks about this open-source model , which we &apos;re familiar with from linux , as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations .
and much of the time it is .
so , that &apos;s the upside . the circular mill is the downside .
over the next month i visited lots of places , some out here , around the country , found the best of the best .
now he &apos;s going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger .
we found spectacular new species , the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked -- from the shoreline to the abyss , form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between .
so it &apos;s not all hopeless .
for example , the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north pacific .
so all of a sudden , this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover , how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years are likely to be resolved .
one of the things that we &apos;re taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive .
and what they found is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean .
and i could spend the rest of my time , which is getting very limited , going through this litany of concerns about the ocean , but i want to end on a more positive note .
well , it &apos;s been around for 2,500 years .
mitchell joachim : don &apos;t build your home , grow it !
the indo-european root of the word hope is a stem , k-e-u -- we would spell it k-e-u ; it &apos;s pronounced koy -- and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from .
now , it &apos;s about five , six , seven , eight pages long , and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page , but somewhere on the second page he begins talking about the notion that he calls &quot; moral imagination . &quot;
and i &apos;ll read you what it is .
rudimentary animal , has a nervous system , swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life .
but let me show you cutting-edge robotics .
so for example , if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand , you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback .
you have data , and data in neuroscience is sensory input .
so that really means i have to make predictions of the future .
what evidence is there for this ?
it quickly escalates .
and if we look at what we start with , a quarter of a newton there , a number of turns , perfect would be that red line .
maybe we don &apos;t all quite move the same way .
but it &apos;s also relevant for disease and rehabilitation .
it was taken in 1965 .
this is 2,000 miles across .
it has not been seen publicly .
we have no geological record prior for the first billion years .
there &apos;s a model of ares here .
this is how we do it .
we put the folded airplane on the balloon -- it took about three hours to get up there -- and then we released it on command at 103,000 feet , and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly .
it &apos;s totally appropriate for a four-year-old .
just beautiful .
there &apos;s a whole gray market for lego , thousands of home-based businesses .
all the conversation stopped . all the eyes turned to me .
they have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road .
but as long as we pretend that co2 is free , as long as these uses are nearly invisible , how can we expect change ?
he told us that brazil &apos;s government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol .
well , i &apos;ll tell you -- a lot .
and who would have thought that scientists trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels ?
do it like wal-mart , get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself .
for example , anything that spreads by a form of social contagion could be understood in this way , from abstract ideas on the left like patriotism , or altruism , or religion to practices like dieting behavior , or book purchasing , or drinking , or bicycle-helmet &#91; and &#93; other safety practices , or products that people might buy , purchases of electronic goods , anything in which there &apos;s kind of an interpersonal spread .
and this is called the &quot; degree &quot; of a node , or the number of connections that a node has .
what we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact , or a known fact , about social networks , which goes like this : do you know that your friends have more friends than you do ?
when did the randoms -- when did the friends take off and leave the randoms , and &#91; when did &#93; their curve start shifting ?
now the same insights can also be exploited in other ways , for example , in the use of targeting specific people for interventions .
or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors , passively , and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within &#91; networks of &#93; doctors .
the system measures the beam &apos;s time of flight , recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return .
in here you see a traditional 2d architectural engineering drawing that &apos;s used for preservation , and of course we tell the stories through fly-throughs .
the work was done successfully in the field , and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the cyark website .
let &apos;s give them a hand .
this is not a negotiable thing , hunger .
this is more than hiv / aids , malaria and tuberculosis combined .
this message , this word , can come out that this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business ; it &apos;s a brilliant way of saving your child &apos;s life .
but when that food is there , it &apos;s transformative .
and they &apos;re starting school feeding programs for their children by the people in the village .
in virtually every case , when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market -- if you say , &quot; we will buy 300 metric tons of this .
because food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person , nation by nation .
because this is wrong .
but , if we start to understand that cancer isn &apos;t just a molecular defect , it &apos;s something more , then we &apos;ll get to new ways of treating it , as i &apos;ll show you .
there &apos;s also a field of proteomics that i &apos;ll talk about in a few minutes , which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease .
we &apos;ve all made a mistake , myself included , by focusing down , by being a reductionist .
so , the states , are equivalent classes of history , and the cancer patient , the input , is the environment , the diet , the treatment , the genetic mutations .
and a response is 50 percent shrinkage .
so , instead of a reductionist view , we &apos;re taking a step back .
the problem is that , if i &apos;m this doc , and i get your ct scan today and you &apos;ve got a two centimeter mass in your liver , and you come back to me in three months and it &apos;s three centimeters , did that drug help you or not ?
and so we can accurately -- if the magnet is big enough , and your resolution is high enough -- you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding of the individual system .
most people find that very soothing , and , interestingly , 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human .
or start at the bottom , and say what outcomes do we want , and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect .
this is important .
you &apos;ll be in a massive headwind .
i &apos;m not going to answer that . but i will answer some of the more popular questions .
thank you very much . thank you .
they &apos;re so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it .
new technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature ; the nature of what &apos;s happening , showing us our impact on the earth .
we can now go to the arctic .
most of the turtles , sharks , tunas and whales are way down in numbers .
protected areas provide hope that the creatures of ed wilson &apos;s dream of an encyclopedia of life , or the census of marine life , will live not just as a list , a photograph , or a paragraph .
i wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films , expeditions , the web , new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean , the blue heart of the planet .
well , in order to fly , just as in a human aircraft , you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces , you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight , and you need a controller , and in the first human aircraft , the controller was basically the brain of orville and wilbur sitting in the cockpit .
the halteres are actually gyroscopes .
but i would argue that flies do more .
crab chewing is actually really fascinating .
the green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential of a neuron in the fly &apos;s brain , and you &apos;ll see the fly start to fly , and the fly is actually controlling the rotation of that visual pattern itself by its own wing motion , and you can see this visual interneuron respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies .
the second reason is , we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever , and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model .
so i can say , with some certainty , &quot; i think , therefore i am . &quot;
we &apos;re just packing in columns , so that we &apos;d have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions .
it &apos;s also more than cataloging because you actually have to build three-dimensional digital models of them .
we can position them in different places , orient them in different places .
it &apos;s the first view .
this was a project to build a 4,000-ton nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship and go to saturn and jupiter .
that &apos;s july &apos; 58 .
so , these are three-pound charges of c4 ; that &apos;s about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes .
the air force version : here we have a military version .
and it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen .
so think about these two tables .
and if i cover the rest of the cube you can see that they are identical .
but , if you look at this plot , you can see that countries that we think about as very similar actually exhibit very different behavior .
and we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat .
and they presented to them a case study of a patient .
the thing is is that no physician would ever say , &quot; piroxicam , ibuprofen , hip replacement .
or you could get both for 125 .
one more example of this .
&quot; what a piece of work is man ! how noble in reason ! &quot;
we use it everyday . we use it in our everyday lives now -- in our private lives , in our business lives .
and light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
can we use them for communications ?
the receiver will convert these little , subtle changes in the amplitude that we create there into an electrical signal .
you also have a critical question now , and you say , &quot; okay , do i have to have the light on all the time to have this working ? &quot;
now we can in fact see where the data is going to .
thank you .
the dna is organized in words , call them : genes and chromosomes .
if you convert that to binary , just to give you a little bit of sizing , we &apos;re actually smaller than the program microsoft office .
and then james watson &apos;s -- one of the co-founders of dna -- genome was done for two million dollars , and in just two months .
we can also look at , at a grander scale , what creates problems , what creates disease , and how we may be able to fix them .
knowing that we can read it , knowing that we can write it , change it , maybe write its genome from scratch . so , what do you do ?
i &apos;ve got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn &apos;t believe .
there also is a set of rules .
you cannot compete with the environment , if you have an adolescent dog &apos;s brain .
dogs , horses and humans -- these are the three species which are so abused in life .
or they go , &quot; sit , sit , sit . &quot;
so now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training .
it doesn &apos;t have to be .
we want a better way .
and i thought , &quot; do i tell this jerk to quit it ? &quot;
and i think this whole notion of these skills should be taught .
i &apos;m going to present three projects in rapid fire .
with the library staff and the library board , we settled on two core positions .
and then we started making new decisions .
the glass was then -- i &apos;ll just use the word impregnated -- but it had a layer of metal that was called &quot; stressed metal . &quot;
ok , so here , this is the book spiral .
the light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure , so you can do beckett with dallas as the backdrop .
have to operate behind the i-64 corridor , a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites .
the moment the cores get to mid level , we finish the art museum ; we put all the mechanical equipment in it ; and then we jack it up into the air .
and then -- okay , this is where we get to the song -- kind of bridges the gap to the emotional .
quiet quiet down , she said speak into the back of his head on the edge of the bed , i can see your blood flow i can see your cells grow hold still awhile don &apos;t spill the wine i can see it all from here i can see oh , i i can see weather systems of the world weather systems of the world some things you say are not for sale i would hold it where our free agents of some substance are scared hold still a while don &apos;t spill the wine i can see it all from here i can see oh , i i can see weather systems of the world weather systems of the world thanks .
aesthetic judgments , rather than abstract reasoning , guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know .
and you can see here how my perception of the sound l helps the alliteration to jump right out .
okay .
daniel tammet : different ways of knowing
the other is obviously a computer mouse .
but if you have a sexual species , then it &apos;s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
he doesn &apos;t need adam .
we call that poverty these days .
the queen does it all .
but there &apos;s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
they gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about 4,000 people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
it &apos;s completely irrelevant .
and as you get all the way up close , you realize that it &apos;s actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups .
i wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of americans who die from cigarette smoking .
a strange phenomenon .
my belief is that you don &apos;t have to make yourself bad to look at these issues .
and so took this first example , which is called coxsackievirus , and just break it into small windows .
and if spots light up , we know there &apos;s a certain virus in there .
and how do we do the positive control here ?
these different blocks represent the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family , so you can kind of go down the blocks and see where the signal is .
they did a ct scan .
in fact , it &apos;s not even really sequenced that much .
and this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it &apos;s related to other viruses .
if in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage , some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid , the difference would have to be made up from other generators immediately .
we need to think about the problem differently .
and i did .
this is that student , david bradwell , who , in this image , appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work .
we call that the bistro table , but it &apos;s not ready yet for prime-time viewing .
is this thing off ?
so eric had an initial design idea for a robot , but we didn &apos;t have all the parts figured out , so we did what anybody would do in our situation : we asked the internet for help .
it &apos;s an underwater world we &apos;re all exploring together .
we tend to forget , though , the other audience that &apos;s influenced by our nonverbals , and that &apos;s ourselves .
you see it on their faces and their bodies , and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny , and they go like this when they raise their hand .
so what does that mean ? when you think about power , people tended to think only about testosterone , because that was about dominance .
here &apos;s what you get on cortisol . high-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease , and the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase .
these kinds of things . people are bringing their true selves , basically . they &apos;re bringing themselves .
so at the end of my first year at harvard , a student who had not talked in class the entire semester , who i had said , &quot; look , you &apos;ve gotta participate or else you &apos;re going to fail , &quot; came into my office . i really didn &apos;t know her at all .
probably none . i think we &apos;re all darwinians .
well , does anything like that happen with human beings ?
this is what our summum bonum is .
yesterday , negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but -- what &apos;s a virus ?
so the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that they &apos;re not being passed on genetically .
they &apos;re like a mild cold .
there has to be , between me and the orchestra , an unshakable bond of trust , born out of mutual respect , through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in .
if you hold it too loosely , it flies away . &quot;
and i think , in no small way , that &apos;s due to one fundamental fact : they &apos;re not bound to a system of notation .
have a listen .
you won &apos;t make the key otherwise .
lyn : when i &apos;m making music , i feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane .
my uncle ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater -- at least i thought it was beautiful .
we got a lot of things right .
who are these people ?
300 to 500 million cases are reported .
if she were born anywhere else but tanzania , i &apos;m telling you , she could run wall street .
well three sons got into a negotiation .
how do we deal with our deepest differences , given the human propensity for conflict and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction ?
and we can play an incredibly constructive role .
now let me take you for a moment to what &apos;s widely regarded as the world &apos;s most difficult conflict , or the most impossible conflict , is the middle east .
now as anthropologists , we know that every culture has an origin story .
and that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
so effectively , we went from womb to tomb .
he said it was like a light that went on in our lives .
well i think back to my childhood , a good part of which i spent , after being born here in chicago , i spent in europe .
thank you very much .
that was our task .
i hear some &quot; aw &quot; s and i hear some &quot; aah . &quot;
we start on day one of every project -- we &apos;ve learned , we don &apos;t make promises , we don &apos;t do reports .
and we &apos;ll go a lot further than that .
he could give school kids in this community the beautiful fly trap you see above in the slide .
and i don &apos;t pretend anything else .
i am a gay talking head on fox news .
political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct .
now this guy doesn &apos;t agree with me , yet .
he came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall .
that &apos;s the beauty of this economy .
they introduced me to the new york city strategic alliance for health , again , free resources , don &apos;t waste them .
how does it start ? well , look at jose &apos;s attention to detail .
and again , when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this , we &apos;re really creating a moment .
make them a healthy plate , especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom -- delicioso !
a year ago in kenya we had post-election violence .
so what we find is that there is this great deal of wasted crisis information because there is just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now .
so i thought , &quot; i will talk about death . &quot;
as i witnessed my father &apos;s body being swallowed by fire , i sat by his funeral pyre and wrote .
today &apos;s hit single is not last year &apos;s hit single .
well , the first thing is there &apos;s a community of engineering professors , from cambridge to kyoto , who are developing engineering content in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive , super textbook that covers the entire area of electrical engineering -- and not only that , it can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions .
&quot; burn &quot; is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses .
oh , great , so it &apos;s the future of the web , right ?
the second big enabler is intellectual property , because in fact i got up here and i talked about how great the music culture is .
so that could be a problem .
they will not say children at first , and then when you say , &quot; children , &quot; they will pretty quickly agree with you .
and now , three and a half years later , guess what ?
and this has been in the press a great deal .
you can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits .
the idea was that it would be not only a laptop , but that it could transform and be into an electronic book .
we &apos;re coming in probably at 135 , to start , then drift down .
are we dreaming ? is this real ? it actually is real .
they &apos;re clicking on things and staring at screens . &quot;
i thought i was very clever .
so now we &apos;re all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we &apos;ve lost on our external brains that we &apos;re carrying around in our pockets .
and really , it ends up being more human than technology , because we &apos;re co-creating each other all the time .
the united states -- a large country -- each year , 7,000 mothers with hiv who give birth to a child .
so again , i look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of hiv in africa .
you go in for a test and you find out that you &apos;re pregnant , and you &apos;re delighted .
these mothers , we call them mentor mothers , are able to engage women who , just like themselves , pregnant with babies , have found out about being hiv-positive , who need support and education .
the father and the mother , together , they get the results .
and then her younger brother stood up and said , &quot; i &apos;m also positive .
and our organization helps women across that bridge .
each person must know their hiv status .
so if you look at gray matter volume , for example , gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years increases during childhood , which is what you can see on this graph . it peaks in early adolescence .
they move the white truck instead of the blue truck .
so the limbic system is right deep inside the brain , and it &apos;s involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing . it gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things , including taking risks .
but my dad didn &apos;t get the kind of robot he wanted , either .
and the more i thought about it , i couldn &apos;t think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference .
so , the success of the tele-actor that night was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor .
we then execute that on the robot , we observe what happens , then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning .
three and a half years ago , i made one of the best decisions of my life .
that &apos;s a lot of food .
the height of the bars is the risk of death , and those zero , one , two , three , four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had .
it &apos;s just completely different .
our friends think we &apos;re mad .
history as an imaging tool ?
did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity ?
now i know definitely which one i would choose .
but when i got there , i found lots of plastic garbage and other debris .
if you want to get to the phoenix islands , it &apos;s five days from fiji , it &apos;s five days from hawaii , it &apos;s five days from samoa .
suddenly , i saw a world that i had never seen before in the ocean -- schools of fish that were so dense they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface , coral reefs that were continuous and solid and colorful , large fish everywhere , manta rays .
and it reminded me of that old joke where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed , and the reporter yells , &quot; hey , willy . why do you rob banks ? &quot;
and the country never knew this . they never had any data from this area .
halfway through this process , i met the president of kiribati , president anote tong .
he paused and put his hands together and said , &quot; yes , greg , but the devil will be in the details , &quot; he said .
as it turns out , when tens of millions of people are unemployed or underemployed , there &apos;s a fair amount of interest in what technology might be doing to the labor force .
and it &apos;s not decent , it &apos;s perfect .
and you start to do things like graph things that we might be interested in , the total worldwide population , for example , or some measure of social development , or the state of advancement of a society , and you start to plot the data , because , by this approach , the big stories , the big developments in human history , are the ones that will bend these curves a lot .
what happened instead is he very carefully documented what happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time to an environment and a community .
what i did do , though is , i actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually an yves klein painting .
he didn &apos;t want any of his friends to be arrested , so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card .
which brought me back to my list making -- you know , just to see what i actually like about my job .
again , it &apos;s the same thing -- &quot; guts &quot; is just the same room , reworked .
this is the kind of thinking that went into creating the 99 .
they said , &quot; your highness , the scholars are cheating .
number one , we have a thing within islam that you don &apos;t leave a boy and a girl alone together , because the third person is temptation or the devil , right ?
my wife is a saudi from yemeni roots .
what happens is the world erupts in the danish cartoon controversy .
miklos : must download file contents .
i worry because all around me , even within my extended family , i see religion being manipulated .
but i borrow a lesson that i learned from him .
naif al-mutawa : superheroes inspired by islam
let &apos;s take a look .
let me highlight it for you .
can you guess what this data set is ?
i just kind of learned through doing .
if you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind , which is about words and numbers and concepts , you start speaking two languages simultaneously , each enhancing the other .
but of course , china has an enormous population .
it &apos;s a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space .
you &apos;re capable of holding conflicting viewpoints joyously when you can see them .
the eden top note is named after the eden project in the u.k .
and that &apos;s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape .
now , you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs .
and in an enormous 40-page paper in german he says , at one point -- my wife is german and she translated it for me -- and at one point he says , &quot; ganz widerlich geruch , &quot; an &quot; absolutely repulsive smell , &quot; which is good . reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide .
you need a computer , a mac will do it , if you know how to program the thing right , ok ? so you can try a thousand molecules , you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend , and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one .
and people often ask me , is your theory accepted ?
working with the harvard business school , you &apos;ll see this example when you talk about minimum payment : if you spent 62 dollars for a meal , the longer you take to pay out that loan , you see , over a period of time using the minimum payment it &apos;s 99 dollars and 17 cents .
we see all this complexity .
it is that simple .
it &apos;s her plan . you know , i have to say this in the houses -- it &apos;s her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time while she studies . but the social worker , he had a different agenda .
&quot; i will ask god for forgiveness and his light will shine through me to them . how fantastic . &quot; this was an opportunity .
i slowly became aware that i knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year .
it is absolutely possible .
maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work .
why did we ever do it ?
we know it &apos;s important for kids .
they &apos;ll tell you raheem really struggled , couldn &apos;t do two-digit multiplication -- so great data , but you &apos;re getting it back after school is over .
the high stakes is today , because you can do something about it .
we have run out of time .
so a bunch of my kids know you can &apos;t come back to harlem because geoff is looking for you .
it &apos;s important to remember that we evolved .
now we &apos;re going to go to the east african and the rift valley .
and we dug up giant tortoises , and elephants and things like that .
we evolved essentially from an african stock .
but we have to control our numbers , because we can &apos;t really hold it together as a species .
i became obsessed with the object -- not just the beautiful photograph itself , and the color , the shallow depth of field , the detail that &apos;s visible , the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together -- there &apos;s an entire story here .
and over a few hours , i eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull . and i didn &apos;t mean to continue , i -- it &apos;s kind of like , you know , you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time ; you can &apos;t think about the totality .
it is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1700 for a swedish count , and it is very likely the object from which hammett drew his inspiration for the maltese falcon .
i spray it on for about three or four days , it drips to hell , but it allows me a really , really nice gentle sanding surface and i can get it glass-smooth .
here , i &apos;m going to put it out there , later on tonight , and i want you to pick it up and handle it .
as a cross-country skier and member of the australian ski team , headed towards the winter olympics , i was on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates .
but this voice kept calling me : &quot; come on , stay with me . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; janine , you &apos;ll have to rethink everything you do in your life , because you &apos;re never going to be able to do the things you did before . &quot;
i soaked it up and i thought , how could i ever have taken this for granted ?
i was worried . i didn &apos;t know how i &apos;d react to being next to her .
i said , &quot; well , i have to get a friend to drive me out because i can &apos;t drive . sort of can &apos;t walk either .
and as i looked up , i realized that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun .
it wasn &apos;t until i let go of the life i thought i should have that i was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me .
i &apos;m not a scientist . i could have been , perhaps , but i work in this world where i trust my instincts .
that is like an anish kapoor flowing through a richard serra .
it comes back to instinct .
it cost 1.7 million dollars to develop . it &apos;s called &quot; go &quot; by bernhardt , usa .
that is the power of organic design .
this is two weeks ago in ccp in coventry , who build parts for bentleys and so on .
cars are all wrong .
i &apos;m not putting charles eames &apos; furniture in buildings anymore .
i bought that last year . they &apos;re very difficult to find .
it &apos;s true . because there &apos;s a soul in this whole thing .
and there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light -- some insects , earthworms , fungi -- but in general , on land , it &apos;s really rare .
so , if you stagger into the head late at night and you &apos;re so toilet-hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light , you may think that you &apos;re having a religious experience .
it &apos;s got a built-in flashlight .
this fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light .
when i &apos;m sitting in a submersible though , i know that i &apos;m not unobtrusive at all -- i &apos;ve got bright lights and noisy thrusters -- any animal with any sense is going to be long gone .
and i had my window into the deep sea .
it &apos;s an open-source project .
so you have situations like this , where some people in chile decided to make their own boards instead of buying them , to organize a workshop and to save money . or there are companies that make their own variations of arduino that fit in a certain market , and there &apos;s probably , maybe like a 150 of them or something at the moment .
so this is the txtbomber .
there &apos;s a giant maze , and joey &apos;s sitting there , and the maze is moving when you tilt the tablet .
thank you so much .
in fact , i have a feeling that if lehman brothers was lehman brothers and sisters , they might still be around .
well , i &apos;m a biologist . i &apos;m an ornithologist .
so i traveled to boston , to cambridge , and i went to this wonderful ig nobel prize ceremony held at harvard university , and this ceremony is a very nice experience .
these are cane toads in australia .
so i &apos;ll conclude to invite you all to dead duck day .
and after some time , this perception became a feeling .
so i connect the eye , and then i play the audience &apos;s faces .
that &apos;s why , two years ago , i created the cyborg foundation , which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg , tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body .
she &apos;d just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent when he turned the paper in late .
what &apos;s happened here , again , almost without our knowing , is our culture has changed .
the trial lawyers say , &quot; well , this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine . &quot;
well , actually there is a reason : environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned for any major project taking the better part of a decade , then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn &apos;t like the project .
pretty soon the doctor &apos;s saying , &quot; well , i doubt if that headache could be a tumor , but who would protect me if it were ? so maybe i &apos;ll just order the mri . &quot;
this is what we have , the philosophy we have to change to .
we &apos;ve been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom .
or if they do have our interests at heart , we worry that they don &apos;t know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests .
and , like water , they will find cracks in any set of rules .
so for aristotle , the kind of rule-bending , rule exception-finding and improvisation that you see in skilled craftsmen is exactly what you need to be a skilled moral craftsman .
he was a responsible husband and father .
all these schools in texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones , and there are bonuses and various other treats that come if you beat the other schools .
if you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures -- which is the current system -- they would do more .
but judge russell did have an alternative .
they made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments .
rules and incentives are no substitutes for wisdom .
we &apos;ve got to attack that brand in front of them .
so 3 , 2 , 1 .
the fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense . they are going to make mistakes .
it was effective not just because justice was seen to be done where there was a huge void .
the private sector has a role .
and in 1945 , we were the only nuclear power .
so this was chapter one .
the main point here is we were dealing with a complete disconnect from reality .
so , what i &apos;d like to show you is what it would take to hold 75 pounds of highly enriched uranium .
he wrote many , many times statements to this effect : &quot; we have the right to kill four million americans , two million of whom should be children . &quot;
i don &apos;t think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time soon , although even that is not completely off the table .
but basically , you &apos;ve got to get out of town as quickly as possible .
once you &apos;re out and evacuating , you want to keep as much of your skin , your mouth and nose covered , as long as that covering doesn &apos;t impede you moving and getting out of there .
i &apos;m going to do some demonstrations .
ok .
i &apos;d like you to come back with me for a moment to the 19th century , specifically to june 24 , 1833 .
richard jones became an important economist who later influenced karl marx .
these tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part-time workers known as -- and this is amazing -- computers , but these calculations were really difficult .
they would have been deeply dismayed by today &apos;s disjunction between science and the rest of culture .
yet , i had a very good answer .
except that nowadays , it &apos;s heavily disputed .
but the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further when a scientist working at the scientific institute decided , &quot; why don &apos;t we try to package these little viruses in artificial worlds inside of the computer and let them evolve ? &quot;
but immediately the system goes like , &quot; what kind of dumb piece of code was this ?
so that inspired me to think about , well , what if i try to use this idea in order , not to detect random texts from texts with meaning , but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life .
so there are some instructions that are extremely valuable to these organisms , and their frequency is going to be high .
because it really only has to do with these concepts of information , of storing information within physical substrates -- anything : bits , nucleic acids , anything that &apos;s an alphabet -- and make sure that there &apos;s some process so that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect the time scales for the deterioration of information .
because for us , even though the light is better on the internet , the data that would help us solve the problems we &apos;re trying to solve is not actually present on the internet .
and what makes it even worse is that that &apos;s just the beginning , because once you &apos;ve collected all that data , of course someone &apos;s going to have to -- some unfortunate person is going to have to type that into a computer .
and it actually worked great .
and you go out there , and you spend money on airfare and you spend time and you spend per diem and you spend &#91; on a &#93; hotel and you spend all that stuff .
unbelievable improvements in efficiency .
so , you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown , you have the non-obvious , you have the non-seen , for the people who don &apos;t dare to go through the ice .
it &apos;s not true .
when brian jones and i were flying around the world , the weather man asked us , one day , to fly quite low , and very slow .
that &apos;s the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking .
pioneering spirit should continue , but on another level .
we have now 70 people in the team working on it .
a little bit like on this picture here .
for the dawn of a new decade , adventurer bertrand piccard offers us a challenge : find motivation in what seems impossible . he shares his own plans to do what many say can &apos;t be done -- to fly around the world , day and night , in a solar-powered aircraft .
the geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world .
and it was a funny kind of sick feeling , but i turned him down .
look at the response to the tsunami -- it &apos;s inspiring .
every week , religious extremists take another african village .
brand usa could use some polishing .
but i want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for .
and it &apos;s very present in a crowd like you .
what i hope is that beyond individual merciful acts , that you will tell the politicians to do right by africa , by america and by the world .
okay , my three wishes .
could be on google , could be on aol .
and i would like it to be ethiopia .
we utter about six metaphors a minute .
the first step is pattern recognition .
third step is cognitive dissonance .
they may feel confident , say , in taking out mortgages they really can &apos;t afford .
take the three most famous words in all of western philosophy : &quot; cogito ergo sum . &quot;
english -- you will see , this is jeans and tights , and an english expression -- the ability to share with the world what is going on in our own country .
and i was privileged because i was born into a family , my father would always encourage the boys and the girls .
and we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today .
because i didn &apos;t believe a journalist can be a journalist with -- how can you talk to people if you have your face covered ? -- and so on ; it &apos;s just a movement .
and i just wanted to share with you : there &apos;s one reporter that came .
it &apos;s natural .
this meant making trade-offs .
and the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers .
finally , with the last bottle in and the last bubble out , i attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in soon enough .
and they had lungs .
i was 95 lbs .
that was the start of my journey to make this film , &quot; toxic baby . &quot;
and you can see these large , yolked-up eggs bursting through the surface of this male &apos;s testes .
p with many plastic baby bottles now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol a , it really shows how sometimes it is only a parent &apos;s awareness that stands between chemicals and our children .
how do you show that ?
and perhaps it &apos;s the connection to our next generation -- like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago -- perhaps it &apos;s that connection that makes women activists in this particular area .
and my urging is that when we think about environmental issues that we remember that it &apos;s not just about melting glaciers and ice caps , but it &apos;s also about our children as well .
here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of baja california .
that day i ended up spending nearly 60 .
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again .
they &apos;re helping us find the news . they &apos;re helping us figure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear .
we had to deal with images from films like &quot; the day after tomorrow . &quot;
let &apos;s see who they are . &quot;
syria has been really interesting for us , because obviously a lot of the time you &apos;re trying to debunk stuff that can be potentially war crime evidence , so this is where youtube actually becomes the most important repository of information about what &apos;s going on in the world .
the bridge looks like it &apos;s crossing the river east to west .
this is the realm of the coast redwood tree .
now , let your imagination go upward into space .
my wife and i adore our children .
and all of a sudden , you lose sight of the ground , and you also lose sight of the sky , and you &apos;re in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil , which is populated with all kinds of small organisms .
there &apos;s the person , right there . the person is waving to us .
what they &apos;re doing in the redwood forest canopy soil hundreds of feet above the ocean , or how they got there , is completely unknown .
and at least for me , personally , the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children .
this is an ambucycle .
at that moment , i understood that this child died for nothing .
i knew i had to stop his bleeding or else he would die .
we don &apos;t transfer people , but we stabilize them , and we save their lives .
i never even knew what tedmed was then .
but yes , it &apos;s also true that the internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
and i knocked on the door .
today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
and that , obviously , is a problem .
let me give you an example .
here &apos;s this russian guy who &apos;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website , and he runs a blog under the popular live journal .
this is what runs everything around us .
that &apos;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .
and they have beliefs about what other people want , and what other people don &apos;t want , how much power other people have , how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want .
imagine for example that sally over here , wants to know what harry , and jane , and george and frank are thinking , and sends messages to those people .
we do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision .
what &apos;s its future ?
out here today , there are a bunch of people -- ahmadinejad for example -- who would like not only to build a bomb , but test a bomb .
we &apos;ve got 800 people in tehran who watch tedtalks .
this heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works .
and the song , 18 months old , went back to number four on the itunes charts .
and i think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading .
it will take elders &apos; voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance .
mau was , in fact , gathering explicit data using his entire body .
and i am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them , as potent as the micronesian navigators , that are going dismissed , that this is a testament to brilliant , brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly .
what is it that drives you in your life today ? not 10 years ago .
so , i &apos;ve had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the question of the real question , which is what &apos;s the difference in somebody &apos;s life if you look at somebody like those people that you &apos;ve given everything to ? like all the resources they say they need . you gave them not a 100-dollar computer ; you gave them the best computer . you gave them love ; you gave them joy . you were there to comfort them .
idiot , robbins . but i know when we watched the debate at that time , there were emotions that blocked people &apos;s ability to get this man &apos;s intellect and capacity .
when a woman stands up and says , &quot; no , i won &apos;t go to the back of the bus , &quot; she didn &apos;t just affect her life . that decision shaped our culture .
second , once you know what the target that &apos;s driving you is and you uncover it for the truth -- you don &apos;t form it ; you uncover it -- then you find out what &apos;s your map , what &apos;s the belief systems that are telling you how to get those needs .
and it &apos;s significant , isn &apos;t it ? so you want to risk your life for it .
leave my family . &quot; which he did . the time was one of the most painful experiences of life . my three decisions gave me a different path .
how many of you know somebody who no matter what happens finds a way to get pissed off ? how many know somebody like this ?
jewish man with family in the occupied territory , someone in new york who would have died if he was at work that day , and this man and the integration that happened is on a film , which i &apos;ll be happy to send you , so you can really see what actually happened instead of my verbalization of it , but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and morals of the world , but they worked together to bring , for almost four years now , through various mosques and synagogues , the idea of how to create peace . and he wrote a book , which is called &quot; my jihad , my way of peace . &quot; so , transformation can happen .
for his first studio album release in decades , musical innovator thomas dolby has been composing music in the uniquely inspirational setting of a restored life-boat . here he premieres a gorgeous , evocative song from that album -- about one night with a legend . he &apos;s backed by members of the modern string quartet ethel .
any dot can be clicked and expanded . and we see here , &quot; i would just feel so much better if i could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips . &quot;
mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world &apos;s feelings in the last few hours .
&quot; i need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that i can feel beautiful . &quot;
you can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a 45 degree angle there . this was amazing because the first night i looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that i talked about earlier -- the differences in age , gender and wealth and so on .
each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world -- a quote that was stated by somebody , an image , a news story , a person , a company . you know , some kind of heroic personality .
so now , we have a new universe , which is just constrained to all things bill clinton .
you &apos;ll notice that in daylife -- rather , in universe -- it supports both the notion of a global mythology , which is represented by something as broad as , say , 2007 , and also a personal mythology .
or seeing the big , white , puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the abominable snowman going to rob a bank .
and so to tune into the clouds is to slow down , to calm down .
it &apos;s to be reminded that we are creatures that inhabit this ocean of air .
it &apos;s really a huge challenge for us .
they would put up 25,000 images , they would go like this , &quot; 25,0000 , okay , okay .
i paid about one million dollars for that machine .
so this is from a virtual autopsy .
the person was killed by stabs in the heart , but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs .
this is not really what the medical doctors are using right now , but i hope they will in the future .
and we heard a little bit about functional mri .
and in just a second here you will see -- okay , here . motts , now move your left foot .
it &apos;s a huge effort that goes into doing this , gathering the data and developing the algorithms , writing all the software .
but the kids were the best part .
well , i &apos;m not going to explain this equation , but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject .
we live in one of these worlds , and i can only show it as a sheet , but it &apos;s really three-dimensional .
we need to make the best mathematical models we can , the most consistent ones .
here &apos;s the number of people in higher education .
it &apos;s very , very interesting what &apos;s happening .
and where they &apos;ve gone . so these are all postgraduate students .
she communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital .
and our wish has two parts : one is a dream and the other &apos;s a plan . ok .
and we summarize them this way : the institutes have got to be relevant , innovative , cost-effective and high quality . why ?
that &apos;s 10 to the sixteenth . and they consume one and a half megawatts of power .
if you just look at these two pictures , these kind of words pop into your mind .
in fact , there &apos;s about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way .
and i &apos;m going to show you a system that we designed to model the retina , which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball .
when you stand still , you just see the light and dark contrasts .
because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it , not even light , so you can &apos;t see it directly .
and the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object .
and the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies .
because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei .
now , this is wonderful , because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope , the smaller the detail that we can see .
absolutely my favorite star in the world .
and that &apos;s the fun .
so , in fact , my graduate students are , at this very moment , today , at the telescope , in hawaii , making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage , where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars , and so few old stars .
yet , he was my greatest teacher .
and every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it &apos;s like to be alive .
in the 10th century , little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune .
mtt : this , of course , was the birth of opera , and its development put music on a radical new course .
where does it go ? what &apos;s left ?
and i suddenly got it , and i said , &quot; friend , by any chance are you trying to play this ? &quot;
and you realize that there is incredible power in the wind , and it can do amazing things .
this is our test site on maui , flying across the sky .
so really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people with these dreams . there are many of us .
i think yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose .
i have here seven note cards , one with each note of the musical alphabet , and i &apos;d like someone to come up here and choose five -- anyone to come up here and choose five -- and then i can make it into some sort of melody and i &apos;ll improvise it .
there are nine billion humans coming our way .
what is going on here ?
you get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you .
even he said that , and he would know .
and there are thousands of other examples of this happening -- of video-driven evolution of skills , ranging from the physical to the artful .
that &apos;s what &apos;s made it into this mysterious , powerful thing it is .
why not a self-fueling cycle in which we all can participate ?
the same trash site is feeding more than 30 families .
now , to make this more concrete , let &apos;s look at the list of top 10 words that statistically stick out in the most favorite tedtalks and in the least favorite tedtalks .
and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speakers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up than the average ted speaker .
good relationships , bad relationships , annoying relationships , agnostic relationships , and what i &apos;m going to do is focus on the central piece of an interaction that goes on in a relationship .
we can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea , for a mere idea . no other species can do that .
and the short answer is games .
so we realized we could exploit this , and in fact , as we &apos;ve done that , and we &apos;ve done this now in many thousands of people , i think on the order of five or six thousand . we actually , to make this a biological probe , need bigger numbers than that , remarkably so . but anyway , patterns have emerged , and we &apos;ve been able to take those patterns , convert them into mathematical models , and use those mathematical models to gain new insights into these exchanges . okay , so what ?
there was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians .
well , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to suffer a short , condensed history lesson about what i would say are the three passages of history : the pre-bureaucratic age , the bureaucratic age and what we now live in , which i think is a post-bureaucratic age .
now , what does this mean for our politics , for our public services , for our government ?
so those three ways -- transparency , accountability and choice -- will make a huge difference .
you could fight for your country , you could die for your country , you could serve in your country &apos;s civil service , but you didn &apos;t really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now .
our teachers deserve better .
if today &apos;s average teacher could become as good as those teachers , our students would be blowing away the rest of the world .
at the beginning of class , i just perch it in the back of the classroom . it &apos;s not a perfect shot .
we would finally have a way to give them feedback , as well as the means to act on it .
and the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy , the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next frankenstein , and as a result , for the next six months , when you googled my name , instead of getting my scientific papers , you got this .
you know , if you &apos;re working with a pathogen , you &apos;re not part of the biohacker community , you &apos;re part of the bioterrorist community , i &apos;m sorry .
you can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere , collect microbes , see what &apos;s up there .
he wasn &apos;t offered counseling before or after the test , which is best medical practice .
i &apos;m not just talking about laws on the books , but laws as they are enforced on the streets and laws as they are decided in the courts .
that &apos;s the day i found out .
they &apos;re at high risk of hiv through contaminated injection equipment and other risk-related behaviors .
one of the key points is to reform the police so that they have better practices on the ground .
then , with industrialization , everything started to become centralized .
and increasingly , everything that people buy , can be personalized .
the highline in manhattan is very similar .
this is an early design for this little three-wheel , it &apos;s an electronic bike . you have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane , but if you &apos;re an older person , that &apos;s a switch . if you &apos;re a healthy person , you might have to work really hard to go fast .
it recognizes where the person is , what they &apos;re doing , fills out the light when necessary to full spectrum white light , and saves maybe 30 , 40 percent in energy consumption , we think , over even conventional state-of-the-art lighting systems .
some say up to five tons .
they used to use the flesh as well for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks .
there &apos;s great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world .
half the challenge is to get access , is to be in the right place at the right time .
but in actual fact , they &apos;re obviously crossing the equator as well .
but again , it &apos;s kind of surprising . you wouldn &apos;t really expect that .
we were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets .
it was only because we had a conference on the isle of man .
and i was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins .
they &apos;re the second largest fish in the world , they &apos;re almost extinct , and we know almost nothing about them . in this talk , simon berrow describes the fascinating basking shark , and the exceptional -- and wonderfully low-tech -- ways he &apos;s learning enough to save them . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction .
i &apos;ve never stepped there before .
toilet facilities : very bad .
how do you do that ?
we are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
i was playing a kid named walter in a movie called &quot; julian po . &quot;
but i was struck by the fact that america , a country with such a tarnished civil rights record , could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly .
and i basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limitless number of people .
i challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but i found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
because i already am all of those things .
and apparently , he disobeyed god , and that &apos;s the ultimate disobedience to authority .
but these are by united states military police , army reservists .
who are the cast of characters ? what &apos;s the costume ?
500 new haven , connecticut , 500 bridgeport .
you should notice here , when it gets up to 375 , it says , &quot; danger . severe shock . &quot;
we did interviews . picked two dozen : the most normal , the most healthy .
five kids had emotional breakdowns .
&quot; nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer ; nothing more difficult than understanding him , &quot; dostoyevksy tells us .
my whole life is now going to focus away from evil -- that i &apos;ve been in since i was a kid -- to understanding heroes .
and you have to say , &quot; mama , humanity is my business . &quot;
evil , meaning you &apos;re going to be arthur andersen .
and there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it ; we should just leave it alone , it &apos;s not to be solved .
and we have a sense that it &apos;s everyone of us that is experiencing this -- not the person who is sitting next to you .
so just think of this : you have a grid of neurons , and now you have a plane mechanical change in the position of the grid , and you get a warping of your mental experience .
the things that have to do with what is known as our internal milieu -- for example , the whole management of the chemistries within our body are , in fact , extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason .
it &apos;s just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem , there are , to make it simple , all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior , different aspects of our body .
and the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory , reasoning , imagination , creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for hip-hop -- and anita hill .
i decided , okay , i can claim the feminist label .
i say , &quot; samhita mukhopadhyay , miriam perez , ann friedman , jessica valenti , vanessa valenti , and on and on and on and on . &quot;
there &apos;s a writer i &apos;ve been deeply influenced by , parker palmer , and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed &quot; between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves . &quot;
she was talking about board meetings , she was founding peace organizations , she was coordinating carpools , she was consoling friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .
if you think about it , this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species , isn &apos;t it ?
this is actually a brainwave sensor that &apos;s reading the electrical activity of my brain as i give this talk .
we created technology and applications that engaged people &apos;s imaginations , and it was really exciting .
in the original zen bound game , you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad .
we can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us , what once mystified and separated us .
but they understood something more fundamental -- the sheer joy in discovery , the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it , the richness that we get from seeing , feeling and knowing the lives that we are .
and on my seventeenth birthday , after my fake eye exam , the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday .
no limitations .
and it &apos;s extraordinary how far belief can take you .
it &apos;s such a small thing , right ?
and that silence just outside a doctor &apos;s office , that many of us know .
and now i had lost it . and now i really couldn &apos;t see .
and i had no idea how i was going to be an elephant handler .
and you know , the oddest part is , when i was on my way traveling here to ted , i &apos;ll be honest , i was petrified .
in two weeks time , that &apos;s the ninth anniversary of the day i first stepped out onto that hallowed &quot; jeopardy &quot; set .
i never had a guidance counselor who thought this was a legitimate career path , that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex-game show contestant .
and at first , it was very low .
and the crowd was full of ibm v.p.s and programmers cheering on their little darling , having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up , and holding up &quot; go watson &quot; signs and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right .
and it made me think , what does this mean , if we &apos;re going to be able to start outsourcing , not just lower unimportant brain functions .
do i take this job or that one ?
it &apos;s a meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge .
on the one hand , we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it &apos;s ever been in human history , where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips .
it &apos;s really , really tiring .
generally the first dog can be relatively content .
this is what warren buffett &apos;s business partner charlie munger calls &quot; a latticework on which to hang your ideas . &quot;
in china , not really understanding the principle behind this , they applied the same principle to green traffic lights .
give them 18 white pills and six blue ones and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones .
what was interesting about the austrian school is they actually grew up alongside freud .
the best thing you can do there to create value is not actually to improve the food still further , it &apos;s to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor .
i don &apos;t just mean through reported pain reduction , actual measured pain reduction .
this is a body of knowledge , method , skill and principle that we threw in the garbage after world war ii and decided we don &apos;t need that anymore ; we &apos;re not going to use it .
the beer goes in and out , the waitresses go in and out , and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in .
you know , eight hours before deadline , four architects trying to get this building in on time , right ?
you know , that &apos;s not good enough .
this is really , in fact , a television broadcasting a show 24 / 7 called &quot; we &apos;re normal . &quot;
the age of the 3,000 mile caesar salad is coming to an end .
life in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally .
you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets .
right . you know what i &apos;m saying .
he popped the question , she said yes . it was a very happy ending .
when i posted this secret , dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones , sometimes ones they &apos;d been keeping for years , messages from family or friends who had died .
this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school .
and the things that they build amaze even themselves .
early on its development , they did a very small trial , just under a hundred patients .
so that &apos;s not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization .
and when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means , through freedom of information act requests , through harassing various different organizations , what they found was inconsistent .
what we see here are satellites around the earth and the earth in proper registration against the universe , as we see .
this software can also be networked between domes .
so , with the mit media lab , for quite a while now , we &apos;ve been engaged in a field called active music .
so we know , for instance , that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced alzheimer &apos;s can still respond to .
and the opera is about what we can share , what we can pass on to others , to the people we love , and what we can &apos;t .
so , first of all , dan , do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are ?
tm : so let &apos;s do it . so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you &apos;re going to play now ?
do you remember the story of odysseus and the sirens from high school or junior high school ?
now just don &apos;t untie me no matter what . &quot;
it has these strong , heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth .
on average , it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that i would regret .
there &apos;s a philosopher , derek parfit , who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and i .
however , had you ended up on the very bottom , it might have given you a slight sense of dread and / or nausea thinking about struggling to get by in retirement .
and just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider .
i have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
the problem for the medieval spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter sheen and the word shalan can &apos;t be rendered into spanish because spanish doesn &apos;t have that sh , that &quot; sh &quot; sound .
depression , for example , is the third-leading cause of disability , alongside conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia in children .
i had to think out of the box about some other model of care .
and in closing , when you have a moment of peace or quiet in these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards , spare a thought for that person you thought about who has a mental illness , or persons that you thought about who have mental illness , and dare to care for them . thank you .
how can somebody like that make you feel smart ?
these guys were philosophers of mind .
we liked each other ; we liked the same kind of things .
there went that theory down the trashcan of history .
the first one was that when helium atoms touch each other , they repel .
you could do a one loop diagram . don &apos;t worry about one loop .
what &apos;s it like to be pals with a genius ? onstage , physicist leonard susskind spins a few stories about his friendship with the legendary richard feynman , discussing his unconventional approach to problems both serious and ... less so . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
they also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin , so they function as an electrical chase .
christopher c. deam : the airstream , restyled
this is five dangerous things .
i have some terrible scars on my legs from where i stabbed myself .
and it &apos;s something we often talk about with the kids when we &apos;re fooling around with things and breaking them open and taking them apart and using them for other things -- and also when we go out and drive a car .
i don &apos;t know why people think this .
and the rest of you have seen such children .
if you can light the spark of curiosity in a child , they will learn without any further assistance , very often .
but they should not be the dominant culture of education .
instead , what we have is a culture of standardization .
investing in professional development is not a cost .
you know ?
there are people who are movable , people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it .
and let &apos;s talk about both what i did for my wife , and what i &apos;ve done for hundreds of other patients .
but what happens for your ligament when i need an intact ligament ?
it &apos;s not software .
so why did the printing press succeed ?
here is some of the lower level of the library , where the exhibits constantly change .
but once you &apos;ve seen them in a new way , you realize that both of these things really are connected .
and it was the hardest invention i ever made , but it got me started , and i got really lucky after that .
what if i could aim sound the way i aim light ?
and so abc and sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket -- initially it &apos;ll be safeways . it is safeways ; they &apos;re trying this in three parts of the country right now -- you &apos;ll be watching tv .
an effect happens in the air , it &apos;s a corrupting effect of the sound -- the ultrasound in this case -- that &apos;s emitted , but it &apos;s so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect .
we &apos;re using very short wavelengths .
appreciate it very much .
so i have a particular imaginative approach to visual work .
and for that same amount of time , i &apos;ve been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers .
and this is it -- just to give you and me a moment to catch up .
time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds , but without the scratches and bird shit . &quot;
and it &apos;s very , very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we &apos;re not contributing enough , or worse , that all we &apos;re doing is contributing to landfill .
rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor .
with a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way .
here &apos;s how to do it at room temperature and pressure , using non-toxic materials . &quot;
the abalone shell here -- and if you fracture it , you can look at the fact that it &apos;s nano-structured .
so basically what i didn &apos;t tell you is that about 500 million years ago , organisms starter making materials , but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it .
and that battery went to the white house for a press conference .
thank you .
and then you &apos;ll hear people say , &quot; well , it doesn &apos;t really matter where i am , as long as it &apos;s really early in the morning or really late at night or on the weekends . &quot;
you might have a quick idea , but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully , you need long stretches of uninterrupted time .
why do we expect people to work well if they &apos;re being interrupted all day at the office ?
that &apos;s kind of ridiculous . it &apos;s a total decoy .
what if they &apos;re thinking about something important ?
we &apos;ve all heard of the casual friday thing .
just don &apos;t have it .
of that stuff , what do you carry ?
and in particular , it &apos;s the mobile phone &apos;s ability to allow people to transcend space and time .
and that is , quite simply , to have nothing to remember .
and instead of using that money to top up my own phone , i call up the local village operator .
but what i like about this is , it boils down to someone on the street with a small , flat surface , a screwdriver , a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads -- because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge .
and he &apos;s a , you know , incredibly poor teashop worker , on the lowest rungs in the society .
so we &apos;re seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation , globally , across all social strata .
our reality right now is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
the usual suspects , like saturated fat and sugar , nicotine , opiates , cocaine , too much alcohol and chronic stress .
so like johnny depp , and like 25 percent of americans between the ages of 16 and 50 , i have a tattoo .
it &apos;s called a lobotomy .
here &apos;s what the answers turn out to look like .
we &apos;re not trying to understand how the problem came about .
this is obviously an incredibly painful experience .
that is johnny depp and me and our seven million friends .
i got this tattoo because i spent most of my 20s living outside the country and traveling .
the percentage of working families without health care up by four percent .
when i organized my foundation , and i thought about the world as it is and the world that i hope to leave to the next generation , and i tried to be realistic about what i had cared about all my life that i could still have an impact on .
and it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world , somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets .
in a world with no systems , with chaos , everything becomes a guerilla struggle , and this predictability is not there .
and it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it .
and we have similar projects in tanzania , mozambique , kenya and ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing : to save as many lives as quickly as we can , but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world .
it was a fairy tale , and then we retired .
the classrooms have natural light .
and they work . people use them . people are okay .
these are volcanic stones laid by hand .
when i see them together , i know that they &apos;re working out how to live in the future .
it &apos;s bamboo .
so , mr. gore , thank you .
the first surgery was a great success .
then apple released the alex voice , which was the best i &apos;d heard .
so i sent them many hours of recordings of my voice , including several audio commentary tracks that i &apos;d made for movies on dvds .
many blind people use them to read pages on the web to themselves .
the initials stood for programmed logic for automated teaching operations .
for billions of years , the universe evolved completely without notice .
people talk loudly and slowly to me .
a guy goes into a psychiatrist .
so what can we do ?
other examples you can see here are from latvia , lithuania , estonia -- the central european countries .
so first you ask a big question : why we do it ? what is the goal ?
and , of course , i &apos;m dedicating it also to my grandmother , whom i think really played quite a lot of important roles , especially for me when i was an activist , and being harassed by the police .
i was running across the street , and the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head .
i had so many surgeries to put my neck back together , to repair my heart a few times .
so they pulled back and they were looking at each other , and they were going , &quot; okay , what skills do we have in this room ?
so i moved on from there .
and i touched it and i went , &quot; oh my god , it &apos;s a laundry basket . &quot;
so he stayed up the whole night , writing away , trying to explain his ideas .
they also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it .
can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the alhambra ?
well , i can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise .
let &apos;s see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle , one after the other .
and then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge , where i can rotate by 180 degrees .
now , this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet .
21 is the closest .
what would our ancestors 10,000 years ago have said if they really had technology assessment ?
now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century , we find a new style of technology .
it &apos;s really a question of the system , how the ship was loaded , the ballast and many other things .
but what &apos;s interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering , at least indirectly , from a human disease .
so this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences .
hold down the shift key to scroll back up again .
there &apos;s the definition as you type .
in the meantime , congratulations .
and one of the things i can do is make it bigger if i want to emphasize it and make it more important .
ban-gap-seum-ni-da .
and what he &apos;s done is he &apos;s actually reshaped , digitally , all of the contours of the mountains to follow the vicissitudes of the dow jones index .
so we didn &apos;t use a radar ; we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals , electronic communication .
all of a sudden , nine percent just goes away , and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody ordered it , nobody asked for it .
pragmatic chaos is , like all of netflix algorithms , trying to do the same thing .
and it uses what &apos;s called a bin-packing algorithm .
these guys down on wall street , marco polo and cherokee nation , they &apos;re eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the carrier hotel .
kevin slavin argues that we &apos;re living in a world designed for -- and increasingly controlled by -- algorithms . in this riveting talk from tedglobal , he shows how these complex computer programs determine : espionage tactics , stock prices , movie scripts , and architecture . and he warns that we are writing code we can &apos;t understand , with implications we can &apos;t control .
why 12 ? twelve apostles , twelve tribes , twelve zodiac signs , twelve months . the one i like the best : it &apos;s the biggest number with one syllable .
and next year , toilet paper .
cars rarely appear on that third road .
so , it &apos;s hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign .
over the past century , average lifespan has more than doubled .
and two tools helped bring the death rate down .
and bed nets are a great tool .
we need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things .
and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year .
we should find out what they &apos;re doing and transfer that skill to other people . &quot;
and it &apos;s a system with very high turnover .
in the teacher &apos;s contract , it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom -- sometimes to once per year .
now , we put a lot of money into education , and i really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have .
raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity .
it &apos;s from 1656 , and it &apos;s called &quot; las meninas , &quot; and it &apos;s the picture of a little princess and her ladies-in-waiting , and if you look over that little blonde princess &apos;s shoulder , you &apos;ll see a mirror , and reflected in it are her parents , the king and queen of spain , who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture .
and as i walked away from that , i had this crystallization , probably from the blow , because it was an insult in a way .
and i &apos;ve come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us .
i knew that i was where i was supposed to be , and i knew that i was home , and i haven &apos;t spoken to you once in the four years since that day , but i heard that you were leaving , and i had to come up and tell you that you &apos;ve been an incredibly important person in my life , and i &apos;m going to miss you . good luck . &quot;
because we &apos;ve made leadership about changing the world , and there is no world . there &apos;s only six billion understandings of it , and if you change one person &apos;s understanding of it , one person &apos;s understanding of what they &apos;re capable of , one person &apos;s understanding of how much people care about them , one person &apos;s understanding of how powerful an agent for change they can be in this world , you &apos;ve changed the whole thing .
we have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights -- lights that can allow us to see what we currently don &apos;t see .
so we go back and we do that again , and again .
i couldn &apos;t when i was working on this .
so that takes more time .
crazy to think that we &apos;re having surgery , we &apos;re trying to excise cancer , we don &apos;t know where the cancer is .
but what about the part that goes into the tumor ?
it requires one team for the breakthrough and another team to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted .
if you look at the y-axis of this graph , you &apos;ll see that , in the mechanically ventilated air , you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen , or germ , than if you &apos;re outdoors .
and that &apos;s that all the sensations , feelings , decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain .
already , a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them , and the numbers don &apos;t do it justice though .
so how do we do this ?
and when the light turns off , these cells go back to normal , so they don &apos;t seem to be averse against that .
now the question is , what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear ?
what if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time , until the seizure dies away , and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state -- sort of like a dynamical system that &apos;s being coaxed down into a stable state .
the eye is still transparent and you can get light in .
juan enriquez : so some of the stuff is a little dense .
because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density , of largely urban density , of connecting people and putting them together in one place , and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together .
i mean , you know , the emergency bunker was right there , was destroyed by the attacks , and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives .
but it &apos;s still a very one-to-one kind of relationship .
i could put up a feed of all those links generated by technorati on the right-hand side of my page , and they would change as the overall ecology of the web changes .
right below him , 0.5 percent , steven pinker .
so 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links .
from mother to daughter , preacher to congregant , teacher to pupil , storyteller to audience .
the film that changed my life is a 1951 film by vittorio de sica , &quot; miracle in milan . &quot;
six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week .
after two years in hiding , my grandfather appeared in london .
if we want different values we have to tell a different story , a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person &apos;s identity , that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity , and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group .
people with high working memory capacity tend to be good storytellers .
now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate .
we need to realize that working memory has a limited capacity , and that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that .
the last one is organization and support .
i think we have a design problem .
so perhaps we could develop a strategy of change , which requires humility . and in my business as an architect , it &apos;s unfortunate the word &quot; humility &quot; and the word &quot; architect &quot; have not appeared in the same paragraph since &quot; the fountainhead . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone age didn &apos;t end because we ran out of stones . &quot;
when i went to yale , we had the first energy crisis , and i was designing the first solar-heated house in ireland as a student , which i then built -- which would give you a sense of my ambition .
we &apos;re adding life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
our first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals in the textile industry .
here it is . it &apos;s the world &apos;s largest green roof , 10 and a half acres .
we studied the biota , the ancient biota , the current farming and the protocols .
now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology -- think google maps , think gps -- the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation .
it &apos;s one continuous processing unit , if you will .
they &apos;re encoded in the dna .
the brain is removed from the skull , and then it &apos;s sliced into one-centimeter slices .
we take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray .
we &apos;re just starting to look at this data ourselves .
now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity .
i think these resources are incredibly valuable .
maybe you look at the past and see .
and yet , every year at least 25 million children do not get the immunization they should get .
do you hire teachers ? do you build more schools ?
but maybe there is another problem as well .
that &apos;s not bad , that &apos;s a good improvement .
so even with partial subsidy , three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net , and now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets , you lose the health immunity , that &apos;s not great .
well , if that had been the case , there would have been no industrial revolution .
that doesn &apos;t sound like that much when you think about it .
so we should get started now .
when people see my images , a lot of times they &apos;ll say , &quot; oh my god . &quot; have you ever wondered what that meant ?
each one has an incredible story behind their face , a story that you could never fully fathom , not only their own story , but the story of their ancestors .
i basically shot everything with short lenses , which means that you &apos;re very close to the action , but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots which gives you a sense of distance , so i was basically was setting up something that would remind you of something you haven &apos;t really quite seen before .
so he twisted his memory around .
and what i was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you .
it &apos;s actually five separate sets shot at five different times with two different boys .
so , now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind , once you know how .
have you ever heard of second sight ?
kb : just don &apos;t break my concentration .
do you mind ?
yes or no , did you feel anything ?
kb : ok , take a seat . excellent , ok .
imagine a connection between you and him .
she &apos;s not taking any chances .
ok , and when you feel the sensation -- it might take a while -- drop it into the glass .
kb : ok , steve , come on up here .
no , stay around , ok .
sj : oh !
sj : i think it &apos;s under my right hand .
so how did it start ?
it comes completely conscious . it &apos;s got state-of-the-art lobes .
and while we &apos;re at it , can we please stop the stigma ?
in rodents , it was known to make mothers care for their offspring , and in some creatures , allowed for toleration of burrowmates .
so in these countries , more economic transactions occur and more wealth is created , alleviating poverty .
make a decision and give me some blood .
we &apos;ve also investigated non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin .
but knowing that molecule is valuable , because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off .
again he asked me , &quot; what do you think we should do ? &quot;
there &apos;s another way oxytocin is inhibited , which is interesting -- through the action of testosterone .
she had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
two weeks ago , i just got back from papua new guinea where i went up to the highlands -- very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia .
but the victorians actually did it .
they do need to be able to read .
so i repeated the experiment . i went 300 miles out of delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little .
computer : nice to meet you . nice to meet you .
we look at it every single day . &quot;
i got the camera angle wrong . that one is just amateur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons communicate .
because it was needed .
grandmother : i &apos;m the gingerbread man.children : i &apos;m the gingerbread man .
we &apos;ve brought it down to the tangent of an angle .
but i want you for another purpose .
so basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you &apos;re doing separate notes , when really it &apos;s continuously going ...
i think we will play another tune now .
on the left are one or more portrait panels in which i systematically order the members of a given bloodline .
in his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here .
and during this massacre , 8,000 bosnian muslim men and boys were systematically executed .
now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits , highlighting a complex relationship to one &apos;s family history .
chapter 17 is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline and the absence of a history .
thank you .
however , what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music .
and so on . if i think of myself as a musician ...
so therefore , this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions .
but it &apos;s meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together . there are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics , dare i say . but by that i mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine .
i &apos;m assuming we &apos;ve all experienced thunder .
i had to basically look at this particular drum , see how it was made , what these little lugs did , what the snares did .
i may feel sorrowful , or happy , or exhilarated , or angry when i play certain pieces of music , but i &apos;m not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing .
this is what it looks like .
/ b / is the first board we started with , and it is , in many ways , the beating heart of the website .
they matched , they found his myspace .
there are plenty of downsides .
you &apos;ve got this surprising semi-underground influence , but it &apos;s not making you a lot of money , yet .
and these animals disappeared , and a separate life , mammals , radiated out to take their place . and so , we know this in extraordinary detail . and so this is a core from near bermuda . we know that the tsunamis , the earthquakes , and the things that we &apos;ve experienced in the entire record of humankind history can &apos;t really quite get around the kind of disaster that this represented for the earth .
we now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size -- we &apos;re going to see where they began in a minute -- and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats i just told you that dinosaurs weren &apos;t in .
a predator . maybe 25 pounds , or 10 kilograms .
you &apos;re really rubbing shoulders with the world &apos;s last great nomadic people .
it has no big claw on its hind foot . it doesn &apos;t look like a velociraptor .
wow .
now , we normally think of tibet as a highland .
so you see the tree of life , but now i &apos;ve added the dimension of area .
it takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs .
to -- you learn by envisioning yourself as a scientist , and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist .
now this is when something really bizarre happens .
the mayans and aztecs engaged , which is why there are very few mayans and aztecs .
we &apos;re not fast .
and what they found is that , if you start running the marathon at age 19 , you will get progressively faster , year by year , until you reach your peak at age 27 .
the key to being part of a hunting pack is the word &quot; pack . &quot;
we try to cash in on it .
so what &apos;s the benefit ? so what ?
but one really struck me .
he &apos;s very bad , leo .
for instance , if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues , maybe they would be a cool , new communication technology .
we try skype , we try phone calls , but my boys are little -- they don &apos;t really want to talk ; they want to play .
so an interesting question is , does the social embodiment really matter ? does it matter that it &apos;s a robot ?
so here &apos;s the first exploration of this idea , where characters can be physical or virtual , and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back .
but i can tell you , the thing that they love the most is the robot .
i then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery , so i started making reference to media imagery -- made it grainy , shot through doorways and so on and so forth -- to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism .
suddenly i was becoming sort of acceptable , which i found also fascinating .
how do we know when we &apos;re looking at something whether it &apos;s real or not ?
this was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper , broadsheets and tabloids .
that &apos;s why this image was made one year ago , and what it means today .
rapid movement , contrast .
they &apos;re not ending up in silicon valley , where they belong .
now , visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind .
i do lots and lots of flying , and if i was at the faa , what would i be doing a lot of direct observation of ?
and the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain , and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars .
it just drives me crazy .
thank you so much for that .
really astonished me was you said one thing you were passionate about was server farms . tell me about that .
wake up .
recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform .
going back , that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school in kansas city , missouri , joins the army , the army gives him a rifle , they send him to iraq .
can you spot the vegetable ?
the more ideas there are in circulation , the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with .
to a first approximation , the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay .
and he called it &quot; git . &quot; git is distributed version control .
and i don &apos;t just mean that always happens with the internet , i mean that always happens with media , full stop .
the bigger problem , of course , is power .
well , i don &apos;t recommend that you try to do that now .
but then also , just to celebrate that , we started an event at jpl for &quot; miss guided missile . &quot;
why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them ?
it has volcanoes on it . and that &apos;s mount olympus on mars , which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet .
now , when i came last time , shortly after the landing -- i think it was , like , a hundred days after the landing -- i told you i was surprised that those rovers are lasting even a hundred days .
as i said earlier , it looked very much like earth , so you see sand dunes .
bc : from this point , we &apos;re going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour down to 900 miles an hour .
so by the time you even hear from the lander that edl has started it &apos;ll already be over .
if we are doing entry , we have to do tests of parachutes .
it &apos;s real stuff .
it &apos;s a satellite which was all made of ice , and we measured it from orbit . made of ice .
and then with an instrument we have on board , a radar instrument , we found there are lakes like the great lakes in here , so it looks very much like earth .
and being the current day , of course , we started our own facebook group .
now i mentioned the phone .
compare those two pictures , and now as a radiologist , you can essentially fly through your patient &apos;s colon and , augmenting that with artificial intelligence , identify potentially , as you see here , a lesion .
here my friend jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so i can save her a trip to the emergency room -- i can do some diagnostics that way .
now we &apos;ve heard a lot today about new technology and connection .
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; fantastic voyage , &quot; the ipill .
not something we usually think about in the era of medicine , but hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars for 10 megabytes -- exponentially cheaper .
we &apos;d like to get therapies better and more effective .
it &apos;s now been fda approved , and it &apos;ll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so .
all because of a word i said , not even said really , only repeated .
part of the poem takes place in space we shared and time we shared .
&quot; behold me , &quot; the god of frenzied , inexhaustible love says , rising in bloody splendor , &quot; behold me . &quot;
she boldly , unblinkingly , even pugnaciously , wrathfully even , when her bottle was empty .
forever . with grace .
so constantly conscious now of death moving towards me , sometimes i think i confound them .
in fact , they &apos;re so well-known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form .
news photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war : a little girl burned by napalm , a student killed by the national guard at kent state university in ohio during a protest .
here it is .
we were trying to ski from this group of islands up here , severnaya zemlya , to the north pole .
and skiing along that first trip , i had two imaginary video clips that i &apos;d replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough , just to keep my motivation going .
the next bit , we &apos;d chartered a pretty elderly russian plane to fly us up to a town called khatanga , which was the sort of last bit of civilization .
the weather is just appalling -- oh , drifted back about five miles in the last -- last night .
so , kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech .
this was the last day i had on the ice .
you can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit .
late 1911 , early 1912 , there was a race to be the first to the south pole : the heart of the antarctic continent .
he was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric .
now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a schmuck .
the most difficult thing , of course , is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives .
so most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves , but we all know what it &apos;s like to be afraid .
now the last option was the longest , and the most difficult : to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of south america .
what would happen to our days ? what would happen to our crops ?
looked at from this angle , theirs becomes a story about reading .
for decades , we have lived under authoritarian regimes -- in the arab world , in the middle east .
they found something called facebook .
and you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of , &quot; how do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant ? &quot;
we were banned from egypt , and our correspondents , some of them were arrested .
i just have a couple of questions for you .
unfortunately in the united states , we are not covering but washington d.c. at this moment in time for al jazeera english .
we were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in bali for a drug injection .
so no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10 , and the other nine in 10 are sharing .
so , if she didn &apos;t invest in effective prevention , she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on , and obviously those are much higher .
now , this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups , and that &apos;s considered stigmatizing .
and he &apos;s probably not having a lot of sex right now , but he is a reminder in the population , of why you might want to be using condoms .
then it came way down .
we &apos;ve got the tools , the knowledge and the cash , and commitment to preventing hiv too .
give him a big old hand .
thank you , michael .
it sounds something like this .
she went up to the foreman ; she said , &quot; i &apos;ve got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives . &quot;
i &apos;m 57 ; still have the check .
good news : chariot &apos;s coming .
and i think i learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief , just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in .
open up now .
that was pacific palisades ; it probably is still there , back there .
folk musician and storyteller david holt plays the banjo and shares photographs and old wisdom from the appalachian mountains . he also demonstrates some unusual instruments like the mouth bow -- and a surprising electric drum kit he calls &quot; thunderwear . &quot;
and i want to talk about three stages in that evolution .
and in this universe there &apos;s nothing fixed and absolute . zilch , ok .
so it works . but not only that , if you think about how natural selection works , then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe .
lee smolin : science and democracy
and i probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism .
so one of the things that we pursued in bali was pieces of furniture .
and if i look at companies that are actually more successful than mine , 3m since the 1930s is giving all their engineers 15 percent to pursue whatever they want .
and probably most importantly , basically everything we &apos;ve done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year .
or there &apos;s a smaller contemporary orchestra , 12 people that remixes its own title .
we got 250,000 coins from the central bank , at different darknesses .
so it &apos;s going to be a while .
and this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone &apos;s participation .
so at funerals , relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about death in this place : its impact on life and the relationships of the living .
what would it be like to look on the expired human form with love because it &apos;s so intimately a part of who we all are ?
who will start me with $ 1,000 ? anyone ?
i &apos;m so sorry . no , no .
this is the first time that i can remember , where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan , you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re borrowing money from him , or if he &apos;s borrowing money from you .
not only that , he &apos;s left-handed . have you noticed this ?
&quot; not so easy is it ? heh heh heh . &quot;
and that day , north korea , that very day , north korea is just seeing if it can just get one over japan -- -- and land it before ...
scottish funnyman rory bremner convenes a historic council on the tedglobal stage -- as he lampoons gordon brown , barack obama , george w. bush and a cast of other world leaders with his hilarious impressions and biting commentary . see if you can catch a few sharp in-jokes .
they went out and gathered them up .
and it &apos;s kind of cool -- if you look at the cassowary , or any of the birds that have crests on their heads , they actually grow to about 80 percent adult size before the crest starts to grow .
and if you cut into an older dinosaur , it &apos;s very massive .
nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike .
so everyone had a big one .
so now we know that torosaurus is actually a grownup triceratops .
and of course , nano has 17 .
so , no walls , no roof , no purpose -- just a mass of atomized water , a big cloud .
anyway , it &apos;s a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed , and so it &apos;s now a memory of an apparition , actually , but it continues to live in edible form .
they weren &apos;t doing their primary work , which was for the government , while they were helping us with this .
and many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open .
we basically did a striptease , architectural striptease , where we &apos;re framing with this kind of canopy -- the underside of three levels of expansion of juilliard , about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of broadway , and then exposing , using that canopy to frame tully hall .
and this is a mockup that is in salt lake city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale .
case in point , this march , the new york times ran a story by james mckinley about a gang rape of a young girl , 11 years old , in a small texas town .
they tend to sensationalize , and they lack context .
this is its cover from november 15 , 2010 .
i never heard anyone say this about anderson cooper and his crew who were attacked covering the same story .
we had to grow them in vermi manure , which is sterile , or hydroponics , and take them outdoors every three to four months .
researcher kamal meattle shows how an arrangement of three common houseplants , used in specific spots in a home or office building , can result in measurably cleaner indoor air .
but people did pay attention to what clothes i had .
only girls are secretary of state . &quot;
so being an american , i decided to set up a caucus .
and my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden .
he said , &quot; bono , wouldn &apos;t that be a good use of your messianic complex ? &quot;
wow . wow .
we do love a good baseline .
you can tell politicians that these cuts &#91; can cost &#93; lives .
could we really be the great generation that mandela asked us to be ?
that is how fundamentally we still depend on shipping .
now that &apos;s because shipping is very efficient .
what else does our sea blindness mask ?
i &apos;d been well treated by the crew , i &apos;d had a garrulous and entertaining captain , and i would happily have signed up for another five weeks , something that the captain also said i was crazy to think about .
if your bank account &apos;s one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
or more to the point , how do you know if a program will ever stop ?
they can take a couple of years , or it can be difficult to design .
and each one of these is just one-thousandth the width of a human hair , ok ?
you get a high-level description of the computer program , a high-level description of the origami .
it doesn &apos;t tell us how babies do it , however .
experimentally , this is what we &apos;ve done in the last year .
because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals .
so , these genes are indeed going back to the populations .
to address this , i , along with four friends , founded ambulance access for all , to promote life-support ambulance services in india .
or , &quot; let me see who i can corrupt today . &quot;
it can be worth up to one trillion dollars , being paid in bribes every year , or equal to india &apos;s gdp .
a set of people actually say , &quot; oh , let me just grant it to them , and run away from it . &quot;
so the data that you &apos;ve got is a great thing called youtube , and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from youtube , all the comments , all the views , who &apos;s watching it , where are they watching it , what are they saying in the comments .
so as we go in here , what we start to see , apply the physics engine again , we see what &apos;s one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones .
and that &apos;s -- essentially , this kind of creative remix is one of the hallmarks of innovation .
at 7 : 45 a.m. , i open the doors to a building dedicated to building , yet only breaks me down .
he did not , happily , follow in the footsteps of his predecessor , and tell us to just go shopping .
&quot; practical wisdom , &quot; aristotle told us , &quot; is the combination of moral will and moral skill . &quot;
his son asked him for some lemonade and dad went to the concession stand to buy it .
we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis .
jazz musicians need some notes -- most of them need some notes on the page .
all we ask is , &quot; what serves my interests ? &quot;
be proud that you have them .
and you don &apos;t have to be a mega-hero .
and the teachers : the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day .
a few years ago i was visited by the guy that runs darpa , the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn &apos;t take the risk of doing .
then , the surgeon says to me , &quot; dean , you need to know more than two dozen of these kids have come back bilateral . &quot;
he &apos;s literally , he &apos;s got no shoulder on one side , and he &apos;s high trans-humeral on the other .
when i told them that they weren &apos;t entirely enthusiastic , but i told them , &quot; it really doesn &apos;t matter what their opinion is .
he had a great spirit , like all the rest of them had great spirits .
&quot; you &apos;ll get them . &quot;
i don &apos;t know the answers .
soldiers who &apos;ve lost limbs in service face a daily struggle unimaginable to most of us . at tedmed , dean kamen talks about the profound people and stories that motivated his work to give parts of their lives back with his design for a remarkable prosthetic arm .
but he felt all his old passion for her return .
the next one is i froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in new york city .
so , i took that as a challenge , basically .
you know , because they go down for four minutes on one breath .
out of 52 minutes you &apos;re only breathing for eight minutes .
the world record was eight minutes and 58 seconds , held by tom sietas , that guy with the whale lungs i told you about .
the neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind , at 15 minutes your brain is done , you &apos;re brain dead .
that made me extremely nervous , raising the heart rate .
i started feeling pains all over my chest .
i &apos;m like &quot; yeah ? &quot;
blood diamonds , smuggled emeralds , timber , that is cut right from under the poorest .
and it &apos;s legitimate monopoly of means of violence , administrative control , management of public finances , investment in human capital , provision of citizenship rights , provision of infrastructure , management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation , creation of the market , international agreements , including public borrowing , and then , most importantly , rule of law .
you only want clean environments in which to function .
so the first is when the scale is that , we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -- it takes six years to deliver infrastructure .
you know , when i went back in december of 2001 , i had absolutely no desire to work with the afghan government because i &apos;d lived as a nationalist .
it is important , but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want is global access .
unless that kind of compact is entered into , you will not be able to sustain the consensus .
this was the fourth take , i &apos;m told .
in the last 20 years , it &apos;s really changed the way that we live and work , and the way that we see the world , and what &apos;s great is , we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift , because now we can literally take the content that we share , we discover , and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us .
tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of miami through 150 feet of tropical water .
most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth . but it has a dark side -- in bioweapons , and in technology that puts us on a collision course to magnify any anger , hatred or feeling of marginalization .
let &apos;s go up and take a look at the himalayas .
enough of the bad news . human beings have always risen to the challenge .
we &apos;re seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago i would not have believed , as the evangelical community has understood the desperate situation of global warming .
and they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox , and they went home to die .
we started selectively breeding animals many , many thousands of years ago .
but something much , much more powerful is happening now .
and before you get too worried about it , here in the united states , the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it .
and it raises the question of how we &apos;re going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology -- a question that we &apos;re not really sure yet how to solve .
we &apos;ve taken away the autonomy of this animal . &quot;
so , we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes .
we are now taking control of our own evolution .
and he went on to say , &quot; these differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate . &quot;
but uvb and uva especially , came in unimpeded .
there was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin .
and the social consequences , as we know , are incredibly profound .
you can touch it .
so let me show you a few objects .
to the right , i took a higher roughness .
enormous disagreements .
mathematicians began to create shapes that didn &apos;t exist .
i read the book that mr. eiffel wrote about his tower , and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood .
and so here i had this theory , and i wrote books about it -- financial prices increments .
and after the war , i saw an uncle again .
first of all , because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn &apos;t make any sense of the numbers .
or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment ?
you can decide , what is your mental state : okay , i &apos;m going to choose the caffeinated tea , i &apos;m going to choose the chamomile tea .
how do you know that ?
less juice , which means keeping herself or himself less physically fit , physically active to hasten the recovery process , which is what is often advocated . you probably wouldn &apos;t do that .
most africans today , by far , are farmers .
the market reforms prompted by the west -- and i &apos;ve spent some 15 years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets , and have interviewed traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent , hundreds of traders -- trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform .
and we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early 2002 .
and in fact , would even dump the grain in lake michigan , rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms .
and in turn , we &apos;ll operate an in-house clearing system , to assure that payment is done appropriately , in the right amount and at the right time , so that basically , we create trust and integrity in the system .
the will is there .
in a way , the static , stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand .
they had to move this village in 1987 as a huge dune threatened to swallow it .
so , the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us .
but , what should they look like ?
but , it &apos;s a beginning , it &apos;s a vision .
so i did just that .
and with that question , i found myself plunged into the world of sanitation -- there &apos;s more coming -- — sanitation , toilets and poop , and i have yet to emerge .
you can &apos;t see her , because she &apos;s buried under that green grass in a little village in liberia , because she died in three days from diarrhea -- the hershey squirts , the runs , a joke .
so a toilet can put a girl back in school .
it &apos;s astonishing , but hardly anyone is still doing it .
after three days , she did an unthinkable thing .
they &apos;ve made it conversational .
people came to study our reefs from australia , which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs .
it fed the slaves brought to the antilles , the song &quot; jamaica farewell &quot; -- &quot; ackee rice salt fish are nice &quot; -- is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern canada .
what that was , was a forest of sponges and coral , which is a critical habitat for the development of fish .
even in newfoundland where we used to catch cod , we now have a jellyfish fishery .
the governments of the world are taking this really seriously .
so what are the oceans going to be like in 20 or 50 years ?
he was talking about the space aliens .
for even in my own life , there are memories i have that are difficult to explain -- happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird , that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life .
the street was entirely empty .
she was sitting with someone who i presume was her mother , and they were talking about the novel , &quot; dune . &quot;
and so i sure am glad i did not slow down to talk to her .
some years later , i and this woman -- we &apos;ll call her &quot; catherine fletcher &quot; -- -- went traveling through the south of portugal together .
i realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes : either catherine would come back to the hotel , or she would never come back to the hotel .
i want to talk to you today about prosperity , about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity .
in the world i describe to you , we have to be right over here at the right-hand side at six grams of carbon .
adam smith , 200 years ago , spoke about our desire for a life without shame .
keynes called this the &quot; paradox of thrift &quot; -- saving slows down recovery .
who are these people ?
the difference with ecosia though is that , in ecosia &apos;s case , it draws the revenues in the same way , but it allocates 80 percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project in the amazon .
what can we offer those people ?
can i picture politicians doing it ?
there &apos;s no photoshop here .
my early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn &apos;t expect to be used as canvas , like fried food .
alexa meade takes an innovative approach to art . not for her a life of sketching and stretching canvases . instead , she selects a topic and then paints it--literally . she covers everything in a scene--people , chairs , food , you name it--in a mask of paint that mimics what &apos;s below it . in this eye-opening talk meade shows off photographs of some of the more outlandish results , and shares a new project involving people , paint and milk .
if it sank , it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill .
and the thing is , too , is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume , which is somewhat reasonable , because in fact , we have designed this system where , if you want to get a job , it &apos;s much more important to have a car that runs , to have a job and keep a job , than to have a ged .
but in the beginning , this was seen as a very morally problematic thing , long before it became funny .
everything that we are really stemmed from this period .
they have degrees in political science , degrees in business -- they &apos;re entrepreneurs . they don &apos;t actually want to be doing what they &apos;re doing .
now on the one hand , the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil , but on the other hand , the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work , generally in a fairly crummy car .
and we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry , which is at least 10 billion dollars a year , into something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute .
thank you .
and i &apos;m going to illustrate what i &apos;m talking about by using the old tech .
why do they keep going back ? what was she wearing at that party ?
perpetrators are much more normal than that , and everyday than that .
so we have it in our direct self-interest , not to mention the fact that most men that i know have women and girls that we care deeply about , in our families and our friendship circles and every other way .
he &apos;s a normal guy in every other way . isn &apos;t he ?
we know so much about how to prevent domestic and sexual violence , right ?
i &apos;d like to ask you , what do these three people have in common ?
and in the last season there were two women in the finalists .
cynthia schneider : the surprising spread of idol tv
now , i don &apos;t know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to mt . everest , but it &apos;s quite an ordeal getting up there .
i &apos;ve heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have .
and taking that into the world of climate change -- which is , frankly , the mt . everest of all problems -- just because we &apos;ve lived the way we have lived for so long , just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long , doesn &apos;t mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on .
in order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global north live in today , we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy .
when you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn &apos;t use any of them really , you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as 90 percent .
buildings are becoming bundles of services .
and if we have another eight billion or seven billion , or six billion , even , people , living on a planet where their cities also steal the future , we &apos;re going to run out of future really fast .
they like the generics .
if not , one or the other needs upgrading , isn &apos;t it ?
then the developing countries applied soap and water , vaccination .
and now i have income per person on this axis .
and then they would remember the first part of last century , which was really bad , and we could go by this so-called great leap forward .
can you see how it &apos;s growing ? and how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in asia ?
now all your different departments .
i would like to show you what happens with the data , what we can show with this data .
i run sweden the same 16 year period .
not simplistic extrapolation .
look at the provinces of kenya . they are very different .
and we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world .
because what happened in the beginning , this stuff encases itself in a cell , then cells start hanging out together in societies .
does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system .
i kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality .
i think you &apos;re just going to have to see less hatred among groups , less bigotry , and , you know , racial groups , religious groups , whatever .
so when they feel resentful , it &apos;s kind of like the way i feel resentful when this happens , and for somewhat the same reasons . &quot; that &apos;s true understanding .
i am very , very happy to be amidst some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they &apos;re reflecting on my glasses .
it appeals to pity . it appeals to something called charity .
support private investment in africa , both domestic and foreign .
none of those countries , including africa &apos;s most successful nation , botswana , has ever met its quota .
we have limited input , because he who pays the piper calls the tune .
the military , 380 billion .
we &apos;d like to interview you about that . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and what was good about psychology , about the 30 billion dollar investment nimh made , about working in the disease model , about what you mean by psychology , is that , 60 years ago , none of the disorders were treatable -- it was entirely smoke and mirrors .
it should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage .
in a couple of minutes , i &apos;ll tell you about some of those results .
but in the third great arena of life , love , len is an abysmal failure .
she &apos;s working her way through college .
the person has to be alive . ok .
and what we &apos;re asking now is does the very same relationship , physical health , morbidity , how long you live and productivity , follow the same relationship ?
let &apos;s just start by looking at some great photographs .
but i turned away for a moment , and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty .
so i &apos;m going to share with you some coverages that i feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography .
this is actually one of the rangers .
back on land , randy olson photographed a makeshift fish market in africa , where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals , the main parts having already been sent to europe .
here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear .
i have a confession to make , but first , i want you to make a little confession to me .
here i &apos;ve been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health .
if you &apos;re breathing faster , it &apos;s no problem .
it fine-tunes your brain &apos;s social instincts .
i want to finish by telling you about one more study .
and so i would say that &apos;s really the best way to make decisions , is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows .
it doesn &apos;t get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out .
we can turn the volume up a little bit if that &apos;s available .
but finally , i got myself involved .
here we have savanna giraffes , but through evolution we have this forest giraffe that lives only in congo .
you can &apos;t speak lingala because lingala was from mobutu , and everyone speaking lingala is soldier .
and what i did for the first war , after we have lost everything , i have to save something , even myself , my life and life of the staff .
i say , &quot; no way , you are not going to do it here . &quot;
and i had mine on my pocket .
i had opportunity to go all over , where herbarium for my african material is .
it &apos;s an amazing story .
when you go on a thing like this , we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months , with a team as small as 20 or 30 , to as big as 150 .
we &apos;re going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters -- that &apos;s a little over 8,600 feet down -- at 30 kilometers from the entrance .
this is europa .
how do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist ?
the bert rutans and richard bransons of this world have got this in their sights and i salute them .
the way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground , and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces .
there &apos;s a myth that you can &apos;t do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years .
so , i also want to explain , because dave eggers said he was going to heckle me if i said anything that was a lie , or not true to universal creativity .
but actually , there was something quite real in my life that happened when i was about 14 .
and it &apos;s the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen .
so their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning , and unfortunately , in the process the fish die .
and you are noticing it more often .
there are also things , quite uncanny , which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book .
or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain , like the cosmological constant ?
the book comes and it goes . when it arrives , it is no longer my book .
and one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years , a record label i started that had a cd called &quot; sauce . &quot;
well , this tv-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours .
so consumers , and i don &apos;t just mean people who buy stuff at the safeway ; i mean people at the defense department who might buy something , or people at , you know , the new yorker who might print your article .
we &apos;re now in the fashion business , no matter what we do for a living , we &apos;re in the fashion business .
these are the people who are obsessed with something .
every one made a profit . how ?
and the people who come up with stuff that &apos;s remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them .
the last example i want to give you .
so i took one &quot; no &quot; off a tombstone from the islamic museum in cairo , and i added a message to it : &quot; no to military rule . &quot;
thank you .
all of the western religions begin with the notion of eden , and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future .
the story i wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the canadian arctic to the gulf of st. lawrence in canada to engage in courtship , mating and to have their pups .
i wanted it to be more like war photography , where i was making harder-hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet .
and to make that point even more visual , i swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death , you know , animals like guitarfish , bat rays , flounder , pufferfish , that only an hour before , were on the bottom of the ocean , alive , but now being thrown back as trash .
but it &apos;s an animal that &apos;s about 98 percent in decline throughout most of its range .
nature has learned to compensate with that , and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds .
and these are animals that had never seen humans before , and i was one of the first people they probably had ever seen .
and i was in a place that had only been protected about 20 years ago .
the deforestation , especially for oil palm , to provide biofuel for western countries is what &apos;s causing these problems .
we &apos;ve got over 1,000 species . we have 137 bird species as of today .
the acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro-climate , to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses .
we lost all the crops . no children gained weight for over a year ; they lost 12 iq points . it was a disaster for orangutans and people .
we didn &apos;t want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation .
so we lowered air temperature three to five degrees celsius .
where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall , that cap is now widening and getting higher .
like here , in samboja lestari , we divide that ring in groups of 20 families .
four hundred aluminum cans .
but i would say , &quot; if i did that , too much would be lost . &quot;
well thank you so much . that was a gorgeous treat for us .
curitiba , my city : three million in the metropolitan area , 1,800,000 people in the city itself .
it &apos;s the concept of the city , the design of the city , that &apos;s also important , too . and also , how to teach the children .
we don &apos;t rip our family portrait , even if we don &apos;t like the nose of our uncle , because this portrait is you .
toonchi-too ! toonchi-too ! toonchi-too ! toonchi-too ! toonchi-too ! toonchi-too ! it &apos;s possible ! it &apos;s possible ! you can do it ! you can do it ! use less your car ! make this decision ! avoid carbon emission ! it &apos;s possible ! it &apos;s possible ! you can do it ! you can do it ! live closer to work ! work closer to home ! save energy in your home ! it &apos;s possible ! it &apos;s possible ! you can do it ! you can do it ! separate your garbage ! organic , schmorganic ! save more ! waste less ! it &apos;s possible ! you can do it ! please , do it now ! thank you .
i believe fundamentally , as many speakers have said during the past few days , that we make very poor use of our talents .
what we need -- and the word &apos;s been used many times during the course of the past few days -- is not evolution , but a revolution in education .
now , doing this is easier said than done .
but , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
and he said , &quot; it was humiliating because he said it in front of the whole class and i really felt dreadful .
this is something jamie oliver talked about the other day .
we have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture .
thank you .
so here steve pinker and i were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries .
in half a century of trying to help prevent wars , there &apos;s one question that never leaves me : how do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return ?
nelson mandela went to jail believing in violence , and 27 years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills , the incredible skills , that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy .
so we all know the three o &apos;clock in the morning syndrome , when something you &apos;ve been worrying about wakes you up -- i see a lot of people -- and for an hour you toss and turn , it gets worse and worse , and by four o &apos;clock you &apos;re pinned to the pillow by a monster this big .
they are human beings just like us .
and these huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor , wobbled to the ground .
we can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known .
so , imagine we &apos;re in the middle of america .
this is a lead case made around the space that my body occupied , but it &apos;s now void .
there are holes at ears . there are no holes at the eyes .
that culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where i have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from georgia tech in 1956 .
so we set out at interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it .
water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .
and the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .
if we , a petro-intensive company can do it , anybody can .
the continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
and we &apos;re all acutely aware : what &apos;s it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony , opera or ballet ticket , when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free ?
this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market , a time when anyone is a potential author .
god knows , if we ever needed that capacity in human history , you know , we &apos;re bound together , not , i think by technology , entertainment and design , but by common cause .
the good news is i &apos;m very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because i &apos;m the only thing standing between you and the bar .
i was adopted by the bishop of the episcopal diocese during the riots , and he donated a row house . and in that row house i started manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild , and i learned very quickly that wherever there are episcopalians , there &apos;s money in very close proximity .
he &apos;s making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people .
and senator heinz sat very quietly and he said , &quot; well , what would your reaction be if i said i &apos;d give you a million dollars ? &quot;
it looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in america .
i beat out all the ph.d. &apos; s because i figured that if you treat children like human beings , it increases the likelihood they &apos;re going to behave that way .
because now it &apos;s become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild because people think you &apos;re bad parents .
and a guy named dizzy gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here , marty ashby .
including my mother and father , who lived long enough to see their kid build that building .
and our partners are zuma canyon orchids of malibu , california , who are hispanic .
i said , &quot; well , where would you build this thing ? &quot;
and in the back of the room , a woman stood up and she said , &quot; in 35 years of living in this god forsaken place , you &apos;re the only person that &apos;s come down here and treated us with dignity .
i am banking on you and i &apos;m banking on guys like herbie and quincy and hackett and richard and very decent people who still believe in something .
so you have an image , a retina , and a brain .
here are three sets of firing patterns . the top one is from a normal animal , the middle one is from a blind animal that &apos;s been treated with this encoder-transducer device , and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic .
sheila nirenberg : a prosthetic eye to treat blindness
and so , the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do , or all the bad things that bacteria do .
again , another plug for the animals in the ocean , vibrio fischeri lives in this squid .
they make chemical words , they recognize those words , and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison .
anywhere on your body , it looks pretty much like this , and what i hope you can see is that there &apos;s all kinds of bacteria there .
they either pop the bacterial membrane , they make the bacterium so it can &apos;t replicate its dna .
what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors , and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals .
i keep getting older and older and they &apos;re always the same age , and it &apos;s just a crazy delightful job .
who should get the best flute ?
and the point , the essential nature , of musical performance is to produce excellent music .
how many would rule in favor of casey martin ?
audience : the endurance element is a very important part of the game , walking all those holes .
seven to two , they ruled .
let me put the point as delicately as possible : golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game .
thanks . thank you .
the first one i &apos;m going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension -- which i &apos;m going to define as 30 years , applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start -- to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging .
and , i mean , ok , i &apos;m not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless .
like , for example , making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all .
before i tell you why it isn &apos;t , i &apos;m going to go a little bit into what i &apos;m calling step two .
i &apos;m saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough .
i say that &apos;s nonsense .
we can call it the &quot; engineering approach , &quot; and i claim that the engineering approach is within range .
however , it &apos;s better than that ; we actually know how to fix them all , in mice , in principle -- and what i mean by in principle is , we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade .
ag : because i am an old man . i am actually 158 .
what i said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification .
and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients .
will government change ?
but i &apos;ve come to conclude lately that it isn &apos;t like that .
now this is a huge achievement .
we were going nowhere .
so when they try to give back , we shouldn &apos;t be on the defensive .
now i put my sister on my back -- burning -- and i walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back .
and as an economist , we can also look at that side of the story .
now we talk about the world bank , imf , and accountability , all that and the eu .
our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money , &quot; sit down . &quot;
aid cannot solve our problems , i &apos;m firmly convinced about that .
they &apos;ll come back home and get disgruntled , and it will result in difficulties we don &apos;t want .
so i &apos;d like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon and tell you a little bit about our process for fixing the city , a little bit about detroit , and i want to do that through the voices of detroiters .
so if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property and we smush it together , it looks like about 20 square miles , and that &apos;s roughly equivalent to the size of the island we &apos;re sitting on today , manhattan , at 22 square miles .
thank you .
and so it brings the second question : why should scientists study creativity ?
it sends out what &apos;s called a midi signal -- or a musical instrument digital interface -- through these wires into the box and then the computer , which then trigger high-quality piano samples like this .
and we think , at least in this preliminary -- it &apos;s one study ; it &apos;s probably wrong , but it &apos;s one study -- we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that , to be creative , you have to have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe .
so what am i showing you here ?
it &apos;s doing something that , neurologically , is remarkable .
and everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject .
communication between people , on the other hand , is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed .
now on to the detection algorithms .
so we have a little bit of time available , so i &apos;m going to ask evan to do a really difficult task .
you know , from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains .
this is one of the ways that vaccines are carried : these are styrofoam chests . these are being carried by people , but they &apos;re also put on the backs of pickup trucks .
well , there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria parasite and it &apos;s a very interesting crystalline substance .
we have every road , every village , every , almost , square inch of madagascar .
well , let &apos;s try to kill it with consumer electronics . &quot;
so , this sounds really crazy , right ?
the energy &apos;s a little bit high here .
there are different types of waste .
it actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there .
and i tried taking the dried food waste , putting it to the worms , going , &quot; there you go , dinner . &quot;
this takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange .
and no one &apos;s doing that just yet .
allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes .
it was a punishment for daring to challenge the society &apos;s rules .
i wasn &apos;t sure why i was sent there , because i didn &apos;t face any charges in the interrogation .
just to tell you , two stories happened in the last two years .
i would listen to what they say , and i would never defend myself with words only .
thank you .
they &apos;re not even enjoying the show .
and i don &apos;t know , i think this project has a lot of possibilities , and i encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day , so you can never forget that that day , you lived .
and they can use that energy in case the wind falls away , and the tide is coming up , and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives , because they are drowned very easily .
so imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea .
this is a project that had its inception 15 years ago when our team then -- we called the institute tigr -- was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history .
so there &apos;s only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle .
and once we had done that , now we can take naked dna out of yeast and transplant it .
so , there are four major watermarks all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code .
we actually view it as a baby step in terms of , it &apos;s taken us 15 years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do 15 years ago on understanding life at its basic level .
yet the fact that so few people do actually read the koran is precisely why it &apos;s so easy to quote -- that is , to misquote .
but all is not lost in translation .
paradise is quite the opposite .
this is just a road . and it &apos;s not very big : it &apos;s about 250 meters on one side , 400 on the other .
there &apos;s the nest entrance , there &apos;s a pencil for scale .
then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest , and i wanted to say that the nests look a lot like bill lishman &apos;s house .
that is to say , if something happened -- and i &apos;ve never seen anything like this happen , but i &apos;ve only been looking for 20 years -- if something happened , they might all come out if they were needed .
then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked .
when i do these experiments with older colonies -- so ones that are five years or older -- they &apos;re much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic . the worse things get , the more i hassle them , the more they act like undisturbed colonies .
and they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons -- they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which they &apos;re meeting ants of certain tasks .
they cover the earth , except for antarctica .
real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right .
but for me , for a large part of my life , i feared myself .
we all know what it is to have pain in our heart , and we all know how important it is to heal .
so , let me start projecting forward .
well , shannon took us , in the &apos; 40s , from here to here : from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the internet . and he proved the first threshold theorem , that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal , you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device .
then they &apos;d ask , can you teach it at mit ? it seems too useful ?
so , in place after place we saw this same progression : that we &apos;d open one of these fab labs , where we didn &apos;t -- this is too crazy to think of .
they were tens of thousands of dollars , hard to use , but they brought computing down to work groups , and everything we do today happened there .
and the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation and the fabrication divide : people locally developing solutions to local problems . thank you .
now when you look at where is the transfer of wealth , you can see here that we have the arrows going into the mid-east and away from us .
so when somebody says , &quot; let &apos;s go more nuclear , let &apos;s go wind , let &apos;s go solar , &quot; fine ; i &apos;m for anything american , anything american .
and it does not require a refinery .
but when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas , because you have plenty of natural gas .
this stuff is everywhere .
see but again , i told you , i don &apos;t have to worry with that .
one of the questions from the audience is , with fracking and the natural gas process , what about the problem of methane leaking from that , methane being a worse global warming gas than co2 ?
so how does the world get off fossil fuels ?
i &apos;m going to talk about compassion and the golden rule from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective .
and there , the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor .
none of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion .
so , their fortunes add up to zero .
and you see this all the time in the modern world .
if there &apos;s one thing i can encourage everyone to do , politicians , religious leaders , and us , it would be what i call &quot; expanding the moral imagination &quot; -- that is to say , your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances .
robert wright uses evolutionary biology and game theory to explain why we appreciate the golden rule , why we sometimes ignore it and why there &apos;s hope that , in the near future , we might all have the compassion to follow it .
and it flew in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t harm them .
so what does that kind of constructive conflict require ?
but when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried .
openness isn &apos;t the end .
this is the parthenon . it &apos;s only 2,450 years old , and look what happened to it .
those white cliffs are a dense cambrian limestone .
and then , how about a memento ? number seven .
ok , onto the mines . the first asking price for the property when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines .
woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow .
i don &apos;t want him killed . i know he &apos;s going to love cliffs .
that &apos;s the long view . that &apos;s 80 miles to the horizon .
and a scheme emerged that long now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley , because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on , and there &apos;s a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition , and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the national park , and it would double the size of great basin national park . that would be swell .
so , when your mom and dad met , there is a fertilized egg , that round thing with that little blip .
every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell , and they &apos;re part of the feather .
so , we got milk , for the american audience .
we have shown that there &apos;s little pieces of dna on the specific genes of the mammary gland that actually respond to extracellular matrix .
the minute he stops , we have neither .
here we have diogenes with his lantern .
and so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer , like the butler used to do , between us and the connections to everybody else .
here &apos;s a couple of studies . one of the studies we do are called diary studies , in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days , and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium , and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media .
one of the reasons is pretty simple . if you go to a date , a coffee date , and you &apos;re completely different than what you said , game over . right ? so people lied frequently , but they lied subtly , not too much . they were constrained .
what does that mean ? what &apos;s the next big idea from that ?
this isn &apos;t a deception-detection machine to tell if your girlfriend &apos;s lying to you on text messaging .
man 6 : holy &#91; beep &#93; ! that is awesome .
and also we wanted to free up the ears , so the sound actually goes through , conducts straight to the bones in your cranium , which is a little bit freaky at first , but you get used to it .
it &apos;s not a demo , more of a philosophical argument : why did sergey brin and his team at google want to build an eye-mounted camera / computer , codenamed glass ? onstage at ted2013 , brin calls for a new way of seeing our relationship with our mobile computers -- not hunched over a screen but meeting the world heads-up .
because i look at the way women are portrayed all the time .
&quot; he ate out , he saw shows , &quot; right ?
it &apos;s just that .
i don &apos;t think there was ever a day where i cut hair i was nervous .
i mean , like making someone who &apos;s already cute look terrible like that .
chef : well , here &apos;s the deal . let me tell you the deal .
an identity was defined primarily by religion .
by the age of 24 , i found myself convicted in prison in egypt , being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments , being subjected to torture in egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience .
where does that leave democracy aspirants ?
they &apos;re transnational , and they bond around these ideas and narratives and these symbols and these leaders .
and the fourth reason , i believe , is what i &apos;ve labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance .
what that will do is avoid the problem i was talking about earlier , where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy .
i want to talk about the transformed media landscape , and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world .
this is what those of us of a certain age grew up with , and are used to .
it &apos;s still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the internet well .
and then this happened .
they also affect people who want to send messages , because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole , not just a particular strategy .
by the summer , in the middle of the general campaign , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve thought about the issue more . i &apos;ve changed my mind .
ok . we &apos;ve heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind .
this is a view of base camp .
they &apos;re on fixed ropes here .
it &apos;s done in the dark , because it &apos;s actually less steep than what comes next , and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark .
the storm was so fierce that we had to lay , fully dressed , fully equipped , laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain .
so the climbers were coming down along this route .
it &apos;s a tackle box filled with medical supplies .
so the climbers passed him by , and beck lay there for a day , a night and another day , in the snow .
he &apos;s running out of energy .
so this is what i can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a spect scan on beck during this survival epic .
in 1930 this country went through a great depression , which led to all the ideas of the state and social security , and all the other things that happened in roosevelt &apos;s time .
in other words , it will be the only young country in an aging world .
twenty years back , when there was a report on bank computerization , they didn &apos;t name the report as a report on computers , they call them as &quot; ledger posting machines . &quot;
similarly , infrastructure -- for a long time , infrastructure was not a priority .
these are the arguments we have which cause gridlock .
we really need to put in place a strategy so that we don &apos;t go to the other extreme of health .
in other words , you &apos;re certainly fast-forwarding this whole process of a billion people going to prosperity .
the caveat for my access was i had to get the soldiers to volunteer .
soldiers : iv ! are we on fire ? iv !
this is paul anthony .
sp : today is sport . &#91; unclear &#93; radio : &#91; unclear &#93; christian soldiers .
they just removed a burnt body , or half a body from here .
when i said earlier , to try and tell a story from the inside out , versus the outside in -- part of what chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding .
and i think it &apos;s such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging .
and he said , &quot; i killed a child .
filmmaker deborah scranton talks about and shows clips from her documentary the war tapes , which puts cameras in the hands of soldiers fighting in iraq .
this is the opening of a beautiful novel by jose saramago called &quot; seeing . &quot;
and it was the birth of the global world .
so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore .
but is this the idea of a free society ?
and how many previous times do you think they &apos;ve been in prison ?
now , each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison .
that program started last month .
this leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change .
i said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ? &quot; he said , &quot; one problem , sir . &quot;
&quot; abdul , are you okay ? &quot; &quot; yeah , i was saying hello for half an hour .
for example , i don &apos;t know if you heard about this , a little while ago in the u.s. there was a muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane talking about the safest place to sit on the plane .
and now , for my next number , i &apos;d like to return to the classics .
and last but not least , the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice .
and they worked absolutely very , very , very hard .
and these job losses , we can fix them with green-collar jobs .
you see the phantom within the aquarium .
this is an mr suite with a focused ultrasound system .
this is the only device he needs in this treatment .
and you have to understand what is in people &apos;s mind when they are willing to take the risk .
he had metastases in his right buttock , and he couldn &apos;t sit even with medication .
they were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound .
he can stop the surgery at any moment .
canal street , i know .
creative inspiration , so it &apos;s both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry .
i tell you , there is no rest for the fashionable .
now , some fashion designers will say , &quot; it &apos;s only in the united states that we don &apos;t have any respect .
magic tricks , i think they &apos;re instructions , sort of like recipes : no copyright protection .
no protection .
there &apos;s an environmental component .
and what you &apos;re looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern oregon .
this is a clonal tree as well .
they contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves , and they also contain records of natural and human events .
if you &apos;ve been in the american west , you know the creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous , but that being said , you see that this has this unique , circular form .
they &apos;ve withstood untold natural perils and human encroachments , but now some of them are in jeopardy , and they can &apos;t just get up and get out of the way .
popcorn immediately goes out onto the web , talks to google , grabs the map , and puts it in the display .
they have a national encrypted radio communications system .
they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel , and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed .
the ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially , and it &apos;s scaling for good and it &apos;s scaling for evil .
but i wonder to myself , for those people that strap bombs to their chests and blow themselves up , how might they use 3d printers ?
well , with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things .
in the wake of 9 / 11 , the best security minds put together all their innovation and this is what they created for security .
how we use them is not just up to me , it &apos;s up to all of us .
and as a woman who didn &apos;t get married until i was a lot older -- and i &apos;m glad i waited -- -- and has no children , i look at these young people and i say , &quot; your job is not to be perfect .
and at the end of the war , there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living .
sometimes very small investments can release enormous , infinite potential that exists in all of us .
and my dream is we &apos;ll have a world one day where we don &apos;t just honor those who take money and make more money from it , but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways .
we face huge issues as a world -- the financial crisis , global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness .
we need leaders .
i find that hard to believe .
and hold onto your seats , because if we zoom in on those faces , remark how they have the same broad forehead , the horizontal eyebrows , the long nose , the curved lips and the small , well-developed chin .
this machine , which we all have residing in our skulls , reminds me of an aphorism , of a comment of woody allen to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull .
and in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development .
so for example i can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound , a repertoire of sound that i make up , that i make , just by exposure , artificially important to the animal and its young brain .
this lifelong capacity for plasticity , for brain change , is powerfully expressed .
these are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool .
it &apos;s what you pay attention to .
it &apos;s that simple .
the brain itself can be noisy . it &apos;s commonly noisy .
this is in a broad assessment of their language abilities .
my issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers , because i think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale -- and the same for kids .
then i understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days .
why i am not getting &#91; any &#93; ?
so far , 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries .
i want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe . that &apos;s why i put all the details on public domain like an open software .
but seven years ago , i went to the arctic for the first time .
and i then went and did a huge amount of training , swimming in icy water , backwards and forwards .
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded .
we stand at a very , very important moment in this history , and you &apos;re going to make a symbolic swim here to try to shake the lapels of world leaders .
it &apos;s all a little bit frightening , and emotional .
i remember , just a few years ago , speaking about climate change , and people heckling me in the back and saying it doesn &apos;t even exist .
now , that &apos;s just one story about oil , and we could end it there and say , &quot; well , oil &apos;s going to last forever because , well , there &apos;s just a lot of it . &quot;
what is the future of truly sustainable , carbon-free energy ?
all the same , what &apos;s different ?
and the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview .
that &apos;s frost-nixon , where frost seems to be as important as nixon in that process .
it &apos;s energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives .
i never would ever agree to interview a modest person .
she was in a great evening gown .
she stayed in her room .
and i asked him one question .
and so she spent almost all of her life in bed , but -- i speak of the life force -- her hair was askew .
just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family .
we conducted months of user research overseas , trying to think like designers , human-centered design .
so we started by finding a manufacturer , an organization called mtts in vietnam , that manufactures newborn care technologies for southeast asia .
it &apos;s not uncommon for mom to put a blanket over the baby .
so that &apos;s the design for manufacture question .
we have to ask ourselves hard questions .
and in these donor meetings , i noticed that many of the worst projects -- which were put forward by our clients , by the governments , by promoters , many of them representing suppliers from the north -- that the worst projects were realized first .
we will lose to the french , we will lose to the swedes , we &apos;ll lose to the japanese . &quot;
and this is , in my opinion , an example of soft power , because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us .
of course , if civil society organizations want to play that role , they have to grow into this responsibility .
the thing is , i think we should give ourselves a break .
one day , 16 years after i had this poster on my wall , i lay in bed and looked at her , and i suddenly thought , i wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that .
not the wife , not the kids . okay , the maid can come in and clean . &quot;
and i looked at his face . it &apos;s like a vermeer painting a bit .
and you know what it makes me think of , is it &apos;s sort of snug and puffy ; it &apos;s like a duvet spread over a bed .
afterwards , i found george on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m talking to you today about the age of design , and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture , is still posters , is still fast cars , what you see at moma today .
we were talking about the rapture ? it &apos;s coming .
even in the 1930s , my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the customs officers that decided they were not art .
it &apos;s about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can in a finite amount of time and hopefully you &apos;ll be able to make it into a planet .
so we have portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most important , behavior .
and what i say to people , it &apos;s almost as if a butterfly were flying by and we captured the shadow on the wall , and just we &apos;re showing the shadow .
fossil fuels are not available , and solar energy doesn &apos;t cook the way that they like their food prepared .
well unfortunately , they didn &apos;t have sugarcane and they didn &apos;t have cassava , but that didn &apos;t stop us .
people can make their own cooking fuel from waste products .
it &apos;s a difficult thing ; it &apos;s a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income .
and imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose , he &apos;d look even odder still .
the adults behave more naturally , and the children play more readily with other children .
after the surgery , they were perceived as being more intelligent , more friendly , more honest , less violent -- and yet we hadn &apos;t operated on their intellect or their character .
and again , he said , &quot; this painting of me with my son jeremiah shows me as the successful man that i feel that i am . &quot;
this is a little bangladeshi girl from the east end of london who &apos;s got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face , which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly .
and you can see in the images afterward , we &apos;ve managed to reconstruct her successfully .
so it &apos;s very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium .
thank you very much indeed .
and the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region .
i really try and teach it to kids . i think it &apos;s the most important .
big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year marketing non-nutrient foods to kids .
now i don &apos;t know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re rich if you did .
so this is a typical menu .
it has to be so much a part of them that they really get it .
but we really have to educate .
so we &apos;re spending less than a dollar , ok , on lunch .
many architects seemed to think that when you design , you design a jewel , and it &apos;s a jewel that you try and crave for .
so we decided to embrace an open source model of business -- that anyone , anywhere in the world , could start a local chapter , and they can get involved in local problems .
so we &apos;ve engaged not just designers , but also , you know , a whole variety of technology-based professionals .
you have to know where your energy is coming from .
and we start construction in june , and it will be opened by tedglobal .
working with residents , getting them out of their homes , so they don &apos;t get ill . this is what they &apos;re cleaning up on their own .
i &apos;m going to whip through this quickly , because i know i &apos;ve got only a couple of minutes .
so why not this many people ?
so let &apos;s take those ideas , adapt them and we can use them .
we are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of long island near the town of southampton in new york .
when i go to a party and people ask me what do i do and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; their eyes glaze over .
and so what i &apos;m going to try to do today is to shake your confidence . because i know the feeling -- i can feel it myself .
&apos;no , &apos; i answer . &apos; conjuring tricks , not real magic . &apos; &apos; real magic , &apos; in other words , refers to the magic that is not real ; while the magic that is real , that can actually be done , is not real magic . &quot;
he marvels at how he &apos;ll do a magic show , and afterwards people will swear they saw him do x , y , and z. he never did those things .
it doesn &apos;t seem that way , but that &apos;s the way it is .
it &apos;s the same thing .
your brain is actually computing that boundary , the boundary that goes right there .
so you &apos;ll see the first picture , then a mask , then the second picture , then a mask .
how many still don &apos;t see it ? how many still don &apos;t see it ?
back in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , an urban planner in london got a phone call from a colleague in moscow saying , basically , &quot; hi , this is vladimir . i &apos;d like to know , who &apos;s in charge of london &apos;s bread supply ? &quot;
so after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges .
who changed their opinion , and why ?
and the afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport .
you heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases , patients who are saying , &quot; you know what , i know what the odds are , but i &apos;m going to go look for more information .
that fall of 1969 , the whole earth catalog came out .
he said , &quot; yeah , we &apos;re going to need to do a ct scan of your chest . &quot;
my point is i went to a respected medical website , webmd , because i know how to filter out junk .
i had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue .
my oncologist and i talk a lot these days because i try to keep my talks technically accurate .
she studied health care like me .
one final story : this is kelly young , a rheumatoid arthritis patient from florida .
let patients help .
and also , the brine that &apos;s produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea .
one fifth of all living mammals is a bat , and they have very unique attributes .
they are the perpetrators in horror movies , such as this famous &quot; nightwing . &quot;
now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies , it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome in a very rapid time and at a very , very reduced cost .
in europe alone , by 2050 , there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65 , and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80 .
so tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies , and you see this beautiful flying mammal , i want you to smile . thank you .
it was that you knew you had to , because , in the late 1940s , country after country in central europe was falling into the soviet bloc , and so you knew you &apos;d no choice .
i &apos;m going to take the one that sounds the weakest , the one that &apos;s just motherhood and apple pie -- governments , mutual systems of support for governments -- and i &apos;m going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance , and i &apos;m going to show you that that is enormously important now .
well , the short run , it &apos;s hunky dory , but the long run , it &apos;s humpty dumpty .
because there are two distinct aspects of democracy : there &apos;s electoral competition , which determines how you acquire power , and there are checks and balances , which determine how you use power .
they worked out they were worth two billion pounds .
paul collier : the &quot; bottom billion &quot;
all right , you &apos;ve all heard the term : &quot; he &apos;s a born surgeon . &quot;
and i think that we can develop some tools to do so .
here in the united states we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world .
we work with a fourth technology .
as we think about intersecting technologies -- everybody has a cell phone with a camera -- we could use this everywhere , whether it be health care , patient care , engineering , law , conferencing , translating videos .
it &apos;s a self-portrait titled &quot; wide hips . &quot;
it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
then i got a call from new york city asking if i could adapt these concepts to times square or the high line .
and what i want to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction , where we &apos;re taking it from the ground , refinement . and that &apos;s one chapter .
people envision this as being very difficult .
what you &apos;re seeing here is , we &apos;ve selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient .
it &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain -- whatever happens after death .
well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
well , who are we not to say this ?
he likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
we live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
and i think there are clearly right answers to that .
you just twist leaves , and you see a whole new world of minute insects , or little spiders of one millimeter , one and a half , two millimeters long , and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones .
by the way , with aphids you have only females , like amazons .
and if this is a female , she &apos;ll immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short .
by the way , they have a very nice landscape -- you see the jordanian mountains on the one hand and the jordan valley on the other hand , and a good , mild winter and a nice , hot summer , which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures .
by the way , the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask .
and this gap really narrows .
this is popular workbench . popular science magazines in those days -- i had a huge collection of them from the &apos; 30s -- all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour -- it &apos;s all going to happen , it &apos;s all going to be wonderful .
the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody . i do a lot of that .
urban absurdism -- that &apos;s what the new yorker really calls for .
and then when it ran , a lovely lady , an old lady named mrs. edgar rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover , it was so sweet .
as we became friends , i became their trustee and their medical advocate , but more importantly , i became the person who managed their end-of-life experiences .
what do you want in terms of medical intervention ?
and here &apos;s shirley just a few days before she died being read an article in that day &apos;s paper about the significance of the wildlife refuge at the modini ranch .
for the past five years , i &apos;ve been taking my wife and kids to southwestern montana , where i worked as a teenager on the hay harvest . and montana , at first sight , seems like the most pristine environment in the united states .
and i would expect that , if our human civilization carries on , then maybe in the next century people will be asking , why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action ?
okay , i &apos;m going to show you again something about our diets .
what do they do ?
some fruits get some insect damage .
and if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mouths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent .
we eat insects -- they &apos;re so distantly related from us that this doesn &apos;t happen .
so the question is , why not eat insects ?
that &apos;s why we &apos;re changing the perception of insects .
look at them first . look at them first .
that means we get our new hips for free .
in fact , when we &apos;re traveling abroad , it &apos;s how we identify fellow canadians .
i draped them casually over the chair in the doctor &apos;s office .
the plate corresponds to a coordinate system .
this is the rete . okay . do you see that ?
so , it is , in a sense , holding a model of the universe in my hands .
there is portable ones . there is large display ones .
so , the first robot to talk about is called strider .
so we have two prototypes .
for most small wheeled robots , they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel turns the opposite direction .
we get so many visitors visiting our lab .
but the cool part is the user interface .
it &apos;s an international autonomous robot soccer competition .
how do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
the rule is : nobody criticizes anybody &apos;s ideas .
which leads to the last topic : do not forget to have fun .
perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with , like many communities similar to it , is that there &apos;s no shared , collective investment in the future of rural communities .
he was brought in in october 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system .
the initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with dr. zullinger -- that was why we were there .
some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores , a greater comfort level with the material , especially with the boys , that in going outside and playing , they aren &apos;t afraid to take on a double-digit multiplication problem -- and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material .
it &apos;s working-class ; it &apos;s blue-collar .
he is 16 years old , loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands , and so for him , studio h means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement .
desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert , and this happens only when we create too much bare ground .
when i was a young man , a young biologist in africa , i was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks .
and watch the change as it goes into this long dry season .
but we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this .
i remind you that i am talking about most of the world &apos;s land here that controls our fate , including the most violent region of the world , where only animals can feed people from about 95 percent of the land .
if you are a blind child in india , you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news .
and the logo -- even though it looks extremely irish , it &apos;s actually derived from the indian symbol of diya , an earthen lamp .
so , hers is just a truly inspiring story -- unknown , but inspiring story .
so the world is this complex patchwork of regions .
so the inference we are deriving from this , and several such experiments , is that dynamic information processing , or motion processing , serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing ; it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition .
so , given that kind of video input , with just about six or seven minutes worth of video , dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces .
pawan sinha details his groundbreaking research into how the brain &apos;s visual system develops . sinha and his team provide free vision-restoring treatment to children born blind , and then study how their brains learn to interpret visual data . the work offers insights into neuroscience , engineering and even autism .
dan o &apos;brien jumped 5 &apos; 11 &quot; in &apos; 96 in atlanta , i mean , if it just gives you a comparison of -- these are truly accomplished athletes , without qualifying that word &quot; athlete . &quot;
in the spring of 1996 , with my goal of making the u.s. paralympic team that may coming up full speed , i joined the women &apos;s track team .
am : no , a year .
i wanted to find out times .
and it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there .
he didn &apos;t find it as humorous as i did , anyway .
moderator : aimee and the designer of them will be at tedmed 2 , and we &apos;ll talk about the design of them .
we &apos;re an hour before the espys , and she thought she &apos;d gotten a two-inch heel but she &apos;d actually bought a three-inch heel .
sunni , let &apos;s just remind them .
thirty seconds . into the network . make the node .
so you used creativity . that was great .
because there aren &apos;t that many people who know how to play , we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess .
but it &apos;s also a morally important one .
some people think this number &apos;s a little bit large , but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn &apos;t get compounded for inflation every year .
i believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work .
so the next thing is take that problem and turn it from a real world problem into a math problem .
it &apos;s the thing you &apos;d like to avoid if you can , like to get a machine to do .
well one of them is , they say , you need to get the basics first .
do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don &apos;t really understand , for reasons they don &apos;t get ?
so if you go through lots of examples , you can get the answer , you can understand how the basics of the system work better .
and very , very simple .
and let &apos;s understand : this is not an incremental sort of change .
just then , over my shout , i heard something else , a familiar rattle .
but what i didn &apos;t anticipate through that rapid transition was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition of my sighted experience up against my unsighted experience of the same places and the same people within such a short period of time .
you &apos;ve got to figure out what they actually meant .
but also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic , social , racial , economic lines .
i thought i &apos;d tell you a little about what i like to write .
i love those experiments , but i think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that i &apos;ve done is my most recent experiment , where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible , &quot; the year of living biblically . &quot;
as you can imagine , i spent a lot of time at airport security .
the second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century america .
this became very , very clear , early on .
this one was unexpected because i started the year as an agnostic , and by the end of the year , i became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic , which i love .
and the thing is , if they &apos;re not harmful , they &apos;re not to be completely dismissed .
that &apos;s how i hailed taxicabs .
so what happens next ? where do we go from there ?
you operate the world as you operate the real world , which is to say , with your hands .
and the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual .
and now , if we want to select stuff , 3d , space , the idea that we &apos;re tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in , not in 2d , not in fake 2d , but in actual 3d .
paul is the designer of this wand , and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what &apos;s going on .
technology is capable of expressing and being imbued with a certain generosity , and we need to demand that , in fact .
and i understand what you &apos;re asking .
and it &apos;s been used most famously in haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake .
and they are also part of the abundant media landscape we &apos;re getting now .
meanwhile , the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work , running late , running errands -- want a little slack to pick the kids up late .
this brings me back to the lolcats and to ushahidi .
but we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value .
you fought by day , then it was sunset , so everyone went back home .
and so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , ravi dhariwal from pepsi , decided he &apos;s going to take it all over the world .
if he had bowled fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go , but it didn &apos;t go . and we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game .
and so , they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived .
we have arrived somewhere . we are thinking big . &quot;
are they grain ?
now , this last minute before i go -- there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
here &apos;s an example : if i were to tell you , let &apos;s play a little coin toss game , and i &apos;m going to flip a coin , and if it comes up heads , i &apos;m going to pay you 10 dollars , but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me , most of you would say , sure , i &apos;ll take that bet . because you know that the odds of you winning are one half , the gain if you do is 10 dollars , that multiplies to five , and that &apos;s more than i &apos;m charging you to play . so , the answer is , yes .
for example , when americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways -- these are estimates of number of deaths per year per 200 million u.s. citizens .
it costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and , if you win , you get 20 bucks . is this a good bet ?
what you knew is , you paid three dollars in the past ; 25 is outrageous .
well , of course , i went to the theater to see the play .
the comparisons we make when we are appraising value , where we &apos;re trying to estimate how much we &apos;ll like things , are not the same comparisons we &apos;ll be making when we consume them .
it doesn &apos;t know what you saved it on .
again , an easy decision , because we all know that now is better than later .
one , the farther away they are , the smaller they look ; and two , the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler .
thank you .
so there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event , but let &apos;s not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read . so there &apos;s a large role here played by the media , who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can .
but if you got attacked , that was something you could do something about .
now , i think there &apos;s many good reasons not to listen to economists .
and it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on piero until i realized that i could look at piero as nature -- that i would have the same attitude towards looking at piero della francesca as i would if i were looking out a window at a tree .
i &apos;m going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster .
for one thing , it transgresses the idea of what a poster &apos;s supposed to be , which is to be understood and seen immediately , and not explained .
and as you know , you have to have a front .
my intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster , in case you don &apos;t get it .
we can understand this process by understanding a little bit about emotions in general . so the basic human emotions , those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings , exist because they motivate us to do good things and they keep us away from doing bad things .
this comes from a nazi children &apos;s book published in 1938 : &quot; just look at these guys ! the louse-infested beards , the filthy , protruding ears , those stained , fatty clothes ...
other labs have actually looked at this as well using different measures of disgust sensitivity , so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are , they hook people up to physiological measures , in this case skin conductance .
but one thing that i am fairly certain about is , at the very least , what we can do with this research is point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place .
my mum wanted to , couldn &apos;t afford it .
boy : what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
now , you talk straight to me , what &apos;s wrong with my films ?
what , of course , happens with that is violence , which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about , you know , south central l.a. and this kind of stuff , and which eventually , when channeled , becomes , you know , evolves and manifests itself as riots -- like the one in france two years ago , where i live , which shocked everybody , because everyone thought , &quot; oh well , france is a liberal society . &quot;
i don &apos;t remember how we got there .
in front of rufus you are ezra the coward .
war is a crime , yes , but i did not start it .
and considering where you are coming from , and when we consider the extent to which it &apos;s not taken as seriously as it should be , what would you have to say about that ?
and so this works the same way ; you pick it up and pop it open .
you can pinch into any page .
the more stuff that &apos;s mine , the better .
in fact , it &apos;s more like five percent .
now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way , those other methods don &apos;t lead to the recovery of plastics , obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics .
and because we &apos;re not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them , we &apos;re using a mining approach to extract the materials .
we blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos .
so i really had a chance to experience that .
there &apos;s something that we &apos;re not seeing there .
so originally i was going to go to india .
what it is , it &apos;s a landscape that is an intentional one .
this is a shift change , one of three .
so they &apos;ll put 20 or 40 up at a time , and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area .
they were just wound up doing these things all day long , until the manager had to , with a stern voice , say , &quot; okay , everybody freeze . &quot;
this was one of the biggest factories i &apos;ve ever seen .
and worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog , and that blog is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month .
and one of the ways i thought of doing it is to use my prize , so i would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings , and the rest is going to be to manage this project , but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands .
but of course , there &apos;s a second observation about the human species that i want to focus on a little bit more , and that &apos;s the fact that even though we &apos;re actually really smart , sometimes uniquely smart , we can also be incredibly , incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making .
this is a possibility that i worry a little bit more about , because , if it &apos;s us that &apos;s messed up , it &apos;s not actually clear how we go about dealing with it .
of course , that &apos;s when we hit a sort second problem -- a little bit more methodological -- which is that , maybe you guys don &apos;t know , but monkeys don &apos;t actually use money . i know , you haven &apos;t met them .
and so we said , well , what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency , if they were really using it like money ?
the more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys &apos; data using economic tools , they basically matched , not just qualitatively , but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market .
so see what your intuition is here .
and this means that sometimes we &apos;ll actually switch our preferences to avoid this .
qualitatively and quantitatively , they choose exactly the same way as people , when tested in the same thing .
a little bad for monkey investors .
i &apos;m wearing contact lenses now so that i can see all of you .
that &apos;s a wonderful thing .
you &apos;ll notice that transportation &apos;s sort of second down that list , but that &apos;s the conversation we mostly hear about .
and there &apos;s a lot of really good questions that are asked and important questions that we spent quite a long time working on the answers to as we put together our report and the peer reviewed report .
the first skyscraper , technically -- and the definition of a skyscraper is 10 stories tall , believe it or not — but the first skyscraper was this one in chicago , and people were terrified to walk underneath this building .
we didn &apos;t have a blog , let alone a dozen twitter accounts like we have today .
so complain as we might , what actually can replace what we have today ?
there &apos;s so many examples i could have picked , and i selected this one of jon bon jovi . some of you may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen in new jersey , where he caters to and serves the homeless and particularly homeless veterans .
what it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information .
we must open up our institutions , and like the leaf , we must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic , throughout our culture , to create open institutions to create a stronger democracy , a better tomorrow .
and if we had been faithful in caring and sharing , we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world .
so , let me tell you , i kind of look at the world this way .
twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message .
i think maybe it &apos;s one time when the bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all god &apos;s children would have their needs cared for , so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks , &quot; in regards to health , are all the children in ? &quot; and we could say yes .
james forbes : compassion at the dinner table
when richard koshalek took over as director of the hirshhorn in 2009 , he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited at the most unique place : at the seat of power in the u.s .
it can &apos;t go in the courtyard .
this is the view from the inside .
it &apos;s taken off the delivery truck .
and i come from a long way .
but one thing i knew when i went to the training camp i say , &quot; i want to kill as many muslims , and as many arabs , as possible . &quot;
as i was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade , he gave me comfort .
your empty bellies on the telly and now it &apos;s you that i &apos;m fighting for .
so we party and dance to their music .
i don &apos;t know how they did it .
well now , my time is going , so i want to sing a song .
he never knew his father very well , because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him .
others of them managed to extend the lives of their clients , sometimes by years , sometimes by months .
that &apos;s the first thing i &apos;ve learned .
what we &apos;re talking about today is also rocket science .
and the kids are in prison , but they go to school from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon .
i hope there &apos;s one thing you all won &apos;t forget : in between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch , there are going to be four homicides in the united states .
i mean , santa claus knows if you &apos;re naughty or nice , right ? &quot;
september 10 is not your birthday . it &apos;s october 10 . &quot; and i said , &quot; what ? &quot;
now , i was raised in the pacific northwest , around a lot of church of latter-day saints people and , you know , i &apos;ve worked with them and even dated them , but i never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission , and i guess i was , sort of , curious , so i said , &quot; well , please , come in . &quot; and they looked really happy , because i don &apos;t think this happens to them all that often .
i said , &quot; what happened to the lamanites ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want it back . i &apos;m happy without it . &quot; gosh .
we have focused on the worst-case scenario .
and he finished his talk with the phrase , that , &quot; the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile . &quot;
it is the ultimate scarce resource , the one planet that we share .
this is an aspirational graph .
and the challenge , really , is to pull the global average up here .
and i think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in .
we did a project for the government office of science a couple of years ago , a big program called the foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome .
and these five ways , which we put onto these handy postcards , i would say , don &apos;t have to cost the earth .
the more interesting question is : did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the good samaritan ? answer : no , not at all .
and apparently epstein aced the test , therefore the article .
when we focus on ourselves in any activity , we do turn that part of ourselves off if there &apos;s another person .
one day soon after that -- it was a friday -- at the end of the day , i went down -- i was going down to the subway . it was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs .
first , we move along linear routes .
if you were to put an actual street map on top of what you &apos;ve just drawn , you &apos;d realize your streets and the distances , they &apos;d be way off .
now this is a bit of a mess , so i decided , of course , you &apos;re going to apply the rules of schematic design , cleaning up the corridors , widening the streets where there were loads of buses , and making the streets at straight , 90-degree corners , 45-degree corners , or fractions of that , and filled it in with the bus routes . and i built this city center bus map of the system , how it was five years ago .
so straightened lines , cleaned-up corners , and , of course , that very , very important geographic distortion that makes public transport maps possible .
i realized then that i , who thought i had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : my thought , my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it .
i needed something to go that extra mile , and i found it in that metaphor which i had learned from my mother when i was four .
ananda shankar jayant : fighting cancer with dance
it &apos;s difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then .
more or less , you read them , you can follow links from them , and that &apos;s it .
this person was born in berlin ; berlin is in germany .
think of the diversity of the web . it &apos;s a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there .
audience : now !
bing ! relationship . data .
and when you connect data together , you get power in a way that doesn &apos;t happen just with the web , with documents .
that &apos;s 5,000 fewer kids dying every day , ten times you lot not dead every day , because of all of these partnerships .
if we have this collected data , and this connected crowd , based upon our experience of campaigning and getting world leaders to commit , i think world leaders will commit to most of the crowdsourced recommendations .
but i &apos;m confident , with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one , i think we can get this and other goals done .
richard branson : thank you very much . the first ted has been great .
i had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who , at the time when you basically sold virgin records and invested heavily in virgin atlantic , and his view was that you were trading , you know , the world &apos;s fourth biggest record company for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind .
i mean , we had -- often , when you launch a company and you get customer complaints , you know , you can deal with them .
is that -- could you still pause on that one actually , for a minute ?
so this interior is philippe starcke designed ?
did he tell you to jump , or he just said , &quot; i &apos;m out of here ! &quot; and ...
to do all this , you must have been a genius from the get-go , right ?
i mean , there &apos;s the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field , aged four , and saying &quot; ok , walk home . &quot;
and then subsequently , &quot; never mind the bollocks , here &apos;s the sex pistols , &quot; the word bollocks , the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the sex pistols &apos; album .
you get excited by an idea and , kapow !
and is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the west get so excited about -- i mean , they &apos;re used to having an idea , getting stuff done , and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world .
and i think one of the positive things at the moment is you &apos;ve got sergey and larry from google , for instance , who are good friends .
and one of those competitions , i just won a small , little transistor philips radio .
so there is an element of performance , and there is an element of sculpture , and there is an element of feeling one &apos;s self , so close to one &apos;s self .
martin luther king would say , &quot; i imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road , without having their motives called into question . &quot;
this is an exact negative .
and this work is in the devi art foundation in delhi .
this is the first day -- it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other .
then , again , that becomes an object .
alwar balasubramaniam &apos;s sculpture plays with time , shape , shadow , perspective : four tricky sensations that can reveal -- or conceal -- what &apos;s really out there . at tedindia , the artist shows slides of his extraordinary installations .
if you look at the official statistics , they typically indicate a little bit above 30 percent .
i remember , i decided to write my &quot; why the world isn &apos;t flat &quot; article , because i was being interviewed on tv in mumbai , and the interviewer &apos;s first question to me was , &quot; professor ghemawat , why do you still believe that the world is round ? &quot; and i started laughing , because i hadn &apos;t come across that formulation before .
avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization .
and i got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design .
okay , lots of you .
and if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the web , it &apos;s very few .
if we go back 20 years , the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand .
the hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings , like the bow of a violin , to produce music .
caroline phillips cranks out tunes on a seldom-heard folk instrument : the hurdy-gurdy , a.k.a. the wheel fiddle . a searching , basque melody follows her fun lesson on its unique anatomy and 1,000-year history .
let &apos;s take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity : the trigger for sexual activity , what happens during sexual activity , and the expected outcome of sexual activity .
you talk about it .
well , in baseball , you play to win .
what i and my colleagues did was put 32 people , who were madly in love , into a functional mri brain scanner .
you &apos;re up all night . you &apos;re walking till dawn .
as if i had asked them to pass the salt .
the second of these three brain systems is romantic love : that elation , obsession of early love .
with the beginning of plow agriculture , men &apos;s roles became extremely powerful .
we sit around it and it shapes our minds .
and i say , &quot; who do you think these men are sleeping with ? &quot;
and so i honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages , that time is now .
i know one girl who &apos;s been on these antidepressants , serotonin-enhancing -- ssri , serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13 .
i don &apos;t know . do you think you &apos;ve got the right person ? &quot;
an hour later they get down off of the rickshaw , and she throws her hands up and she says , &quot; wasn &apos;t that wonderful ? &quot;
she was fat .
now your blood sugar levels start to rise , and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease , cancer , even alzheimer &apos;s disease , and amputations , just like that woman a few years earlier .
consider the following analogy : think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table .
if you ask yourself , what &apos;s a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant , the answer probably isn &apos;t too much food .
and finally , once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet , how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception ?
my life is guided by two great passions , and the first is automobiles .
and it really struck me as the years went by , when i would go to some stream that i &apos;d loved , and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies , and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it .
we &apos;re developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word -- economically , socially and environmentally .
and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised .
and every night i go home , my commute is a total crapshoot .
you know , we &apos;ve come a long way .
this is a minute 59 .
it &apos;s what i do for a living , sort of laurence llewelyn-bowen .
and so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did , was hold the patient &apos;s hand to comfort them . human gesture -- which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible .
we co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another .
and then use that information to fuel solutions ?
showing a series of inspiring , unusual and playful products , british branding and design guru paul bennett explains that design doesn &apos;t have to be about grand gestures , but can solve small , universal and overlooked problems .
and once that happened , they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished .
and we plan to extend this to other parts of the city .
i am so happy that my students did this campaign .
so , today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in india ?
and at that period it was -- in a way , a number of things were happening .
it &apos;s only the beginning of the problem .
if i pull back from that global picture , and i look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which , as a tool , is a tool for designers , and i cite our own experience as a company , and i just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology ?
in other words , we didn &apos;t have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building .
i mean , this is a glimpse of the interior of our hong kong bank of 1979 , which opened in 1985 , with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here .
so really , retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean , it was virtually pollution-free .
and our translation of that , using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years , is to say , what if that , instead of being just a pipe , what if it is a lifeline ?
and that &apos;s a concerted platform .
and what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum .
or something like this , which is the lighting design he did for general motors , for the car showroom .
and that is how , maybe in the near future , light can help hospitals to make people better sooner , recover them quicker .
and how can light help there ?
so we have to rethink the way we light our cities .
and we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments .
in &apos; 85 , &apos; 86 , i was in bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands , on the fields of the poor people , and how to develop research technologies , which are based on the knowledge of the people .
and when it takes the nectar , the flowers don &apos;t feel shortchanged .
look at this . this is the site of the government of india .
so honey bee network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich .
look at this lady , ram timari devi , on a grain bin . in champaran , we had a shodh yatra and we were walking in the land where gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy , pain of indigo growers .
but that &apos;s not enough , what he did . look at what he did here .
in the scaling up , there &apos;s an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people , point by point , with the supply that you &apos;re making .
wonderful human being , but he stills sells , at this age , honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood , because we haven &apos;t been able to convince the water park people , the lake people , in &#91; unclear &#93; operations .
but this innovation emerged in brazil .
i will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity , a whole range of things .
you &apos;ve probably seen something like this before .
and it started to take off . and you can see that the units started to trend up , the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off .
as you probably know , gene sequencing -- in a large part , because it &apos;s built on computers -- is falling in price at a kind of a moore &apos;s law-like level .
and if you look at the trends here , by about 2008 -- and i don &apos;t think this is a crazy forecast -- they &apos;ll be two percent of auto sales .
they &apos;re facing a force that they haven &apos;t faced before .
they use mobutu as metaphor .
in 2002 i met this incredible entrepreneur named amitabha sadangi from india , who &apos;d been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet .
and while , again , you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in india into pakistan , just to get the permits , over time we were able to start a company with dr. sono , who runs a large community development organization in the thar desert , which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country .
and if we take that notion of a global innovation fund , we could use this time to invest not directly in government , though we would have government &apos;s blessing , nor in international experts , but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country .
we asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons .
jacqueline novogratz : a third way to think about aid
he makes enough money , just by running ads , to support his family up in oregon .
and i wrote a post about how i was so mad at him ; he was such a tyrant because he would not let me buy this banjo .
norman rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms , and this is not something to be considered high art . &quot;
but i think blogs are basically just an evolution , and that &apos;s where we are today .
and so you have this record and , you know , this is my great-great-grandmother .
and this was one of those instances where i realized how much blogging affects our relationship , and flattening this sort of world .
bluefin are pursued wherever they go -- there is a gold rush on earth , and this is a gold rush for bluefin .
most of us from the ship -- even i -- look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea .
we go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it &apos;s pretty amazing . it feels wonderful .
but that &apos;s about half the size of the biggest tuna we &apos;ve ever tagged .
astronomically , we &apos;re calculating positions .
but there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer .
so what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are .
make killer apps , if you will .
and then literally just out of nowhere , the guy asks me , &quot; where were you september 12th ? &quot;
by the way , you folks know that in the united states , you can &apos;t take photographs of federal buildings , but google can do it for you .
so ever since then , before i would go anywhere , i would call the fbi .
and then you see , these are some of the meals that i &apos;ve been fed on the planes .
and there &apos;s a verification taking place .
so sometimes the databases get so specific .
and i understand that , on an individual level , it &apos;s purely symbolic .
not really sure why they show up , but they do .
today i &apos;d like to explore with you why the answer to this question will become profoundly important in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset .
this side of airbnb really hit home to sebastian last summer during the london riots .
at the time , she didn &apos;t realize that she was actually hitting on a bigger idea she later called service networking .
well , this isn &apos;t anything new . just think of power sellers on ebay or star ratings on amazon .
there are actually a wave of startups like connect.me and legit and trustcloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate , monitor and use your online reputation .
on airbnb , the people often become more important than the spaces . on taskrabbit , it gives people control of their economic activity .
a lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .
it has 40 different components put together by other people .
we &apos;re not just talking about a fluke .
and at the more unequal end , fathers &apos; income is much more important -- in the u.k. , usa .
so we conclude that it doesn &apos;t much matter how you get your greater equality , as long as you get there somehow .
and the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance .
i think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can .
we just don &apos;t think about our bodies very much .
so we &apos;re starting to build a phrase .
kick , replace , change a leg . kick , replace , change the leg .
so this is a mental picture , i &apos;m describing a mental , vivid picture that enables dancers to make choices for themselves about what to make .
in fact , it was teeming with smart , ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ceos who had wined and dined me six months earlier when i was a rising star in the missouri senate .
but when i came out , i vowed that i was going to do whatever i could to make sure that guys like the ones i was locked up with didn &apos;t have to waste any more of their life than they already had .
first of all , look at the shape -- it &apos;s just wonderful to look at .
now , the weird thing is google lies , because if i type &quot; design and emotion , &quot; it says , &quot; you don &apos;t need the &apos; and . &apos; we do it anyway . &quot;
she brought students in to solve problems .
we dislike bitter tastes , we dislike loud sounds , we dislike hot temperatures , cold temperatures .
it will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours -- and not waste water , by the way , because it recirculates the same dirty water .
owners of the hummer have said , &quot; you know i &apos;ve owned many cars in my life -- all sorts of exotic cars , but never have i had a car that attracted so much attention . &quot;
and if i succeed in doing that , maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on , and perhaps help me do my work .
when you take education and technology , then i find in the literature that , you know , things like websites , collaborative environments -- you &apos;ve been listening to all that in the morning -- it &apos;s always piloted first in the best schools , the best urban schools , and , according to me , biases the result .
i had an office in those days which bordered a slum , an urban slum , so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum .
at this time there was a -- the main question was about english .
i also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors , and i was using regular , normal pcs , so i needed different climates , for which india is also great , because we have very cold , very hot , and so on .
and surrounding him are usually three other children , who are advising him on what they should do .
natural systems are all self-organizing : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies -- except for the debate about an intelligent designer .
but to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a 404 page actually is .
that &apos;s the 404 feeling .
because back to the whole relationship issue , what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you &apos;re not , or it can remind me of why i should love you .
these things really interested me .
and there , i dealt with things like the middle east peace process , the lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later , if you wish -- but above all , my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons .
i had been steeped in the intelligence on iraq and its wmd , and my testimony to the inquiry said three things : that the government exaggerated the intelligence , which was very clear in all the years i &apos;d read it .
a lot of my friends were still in it .
she said , &quot; why don &apos;t you advise the kosovars ?
and it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ? what if ! , which some of you have probably heard of .
we have no choice but to embrace that reality .
i mean , incredibly logical . so obvious , anybody could get it .
so most everyone watches tv .
that is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
okay , here we go .
you get to 1969 , and look what happens .
archie bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
look what happens when we keep going .
so thanks very much .
maybe he &apos;s floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere , and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good .
so this stuff is not that hard , right ?
what is the point ? &quot;
pick up a camera , start to write a blog , whatever , but leave out the seriousness , leave out the jargon .
in 1902 , the great american psychologist william james wrote about the many varieties of religious experience .
and that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences .
and once people circle around some sacred object or value , they &apos;ll then work as a team and fight to defend it .
now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years , but it &apos;s about to make a major comeback this year , especially after e.o. wilson &apos;s book comes out in april , making a very strong case that we , and several other species , are products of group selection .
we start with just one green , and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food .
and they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet , which is human cooperation -- a force for construction and destruction .
it &apos;s about joining with others to pursue moral ideas .
jh : thank you .
it has neon concert posters , a bar and , of course , the leg lamp , which is very important .
it was built by this man who is wayne mccullough .
how is the connection between happiness and gratefulness ?
that &apos;s how gratefulness happens .
it isn &apos;t as bad as it might seem .
we have to stop . we have to get quiet .
there is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware how important this is and how this can change our world .
and i &apos;ve since then tried to keep technology at arm &apos;s length in many ways , so it doesn &apos;t master my life .
and i think once we ask that question we have to go back , actually , to life . because obviously , if we keep extending the origins of technology far back , i think we come back to life at some point .
but we see that each one of these is actually hacking , and has a different way of finding out how to do life .
this is a scene from star wars where the 3po comes out and he sees machines making machines . how depraved !
all of them are still being produced . so you &apos;ve got corn shellers .
that &apos;s the definition . there was no temperature .
it &apos;s a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more .
and this has always been the case , throughout history .
they &apos;ll ignore external radio signals and send very few of their own .
now , if you &apos;re a marketer , you might then target them with product samples , try to spread your brand through their social group .
and civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones , and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down , they should notify humans to their presence .
and as i looked at it , it kind of tucked its arms under it , raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes .
he said , &quot; make a movie about this expedition . &quot;
and they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging , but this particular one used vision .
but we &apos;re just going to zip right past this area , this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge , which i think is even more extraordinary .
but you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead .
it &apos;s got living coral , fish all over the place , crystal clear water , and you go , &quot; how did that happen ? &quot;
look in your own backyard , in fact , look in the mirror .
after finishing this series of protests , i started questioning why my fate was like this , and i realized that it &apos;s not just me -- all chinese are as confused as i am .
this is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the hudson river .
i think that in art , an artist &apos;s attitude is the most important element .
now the rules that i &apos;m talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture .
and then i thought -- in my 40s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos;t i do something ?
and the tsunami of problems that we feel we &apos;re facing in terms of sustainability questions are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet .
is london a great big whale ?
and you see , you &apos;re very familiar with this .
it says that , if it were linear , the steepest slope , then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy .
there is a scaling .
this , no doubt , is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities .
and it &apos;s destined to collapse for many reasons -- kind of malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources .
so if i &apos;d have done this in 1994 , i could have predicted what walmart would be now .
year two : learned a few things -- had to change my tactic .
there was no expense cost . perfect field trip .
my students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill .
ask them really interesting questions .
and this is the idea that science magazine used on their front cover .
this is from &quot; the untied states of america . &quot;
why couldn &apos;t we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was symptomatic ?
by the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that anymore .
this is a diabetic ulcer . it &apos;s tragic .
but could you go a little further ?
these are now two years out .
in this case here , a new , wearable bio-reactor has been designed -- it should be tested clinically later this year at isr -- by joerg gerlach in pittsburgh .
in the united states we &apos;ve had a somewhat different approach .
hollywood has its rivalries , and the valley has its rivalries .
but for a young man that made a real impression on me , that one never knows how much time one really has .
and to put a face on it , people like muhammad yunus , who started the grameen bank , has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world , won the nobel peace prize .
and our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change .
and i really thought this was going to be a straight-to-pbs charitable initiative .
and i believe that , working together , we can make all of these things happen .
some of us do survive malaria ; we do survive aids .
all right , this is a slide from a talk i gave about intensive care units in nigeria , and jokingly we refer to it as &quot; expensive scare . &quot;
he had to get on the phone . this guy was always on the phone .
have you seen one of those before ?
this is what makes it so special .
and so i committed -- when i left south africa , when i left capetown , i told myself , &quot; this is going to be something that i have to talk about .
i &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- i went to about 12 different countries .
and here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year-old baby .
our enemies shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own confusion .
but overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated .
now in china , you have the &quot; great firewall , &quot; as it &apos;s well-known , that blocks facebook and twitter and now google + and many of the other overseas websites .
after all , companies didn &apos;t stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course , or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course , just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do .
so what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime ?
well , he would turn to people who were called , rather prosaically by sociologists , privatized law enforcement agencies .
six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade .
and remember , 20 of these speed boats were coming across the adriatic every single night .
there has , however , been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces .
or to use the technical term for it , there &apos;s one born every minute .
it is a major economic force and we need to take it very , very seriously .
they knew what happened .
you &apos;ve got this beautiful paradigm .
and the irony of it is , that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn &apos;t have to wait for a new paradigm to come up .
this has come &apos; round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .
the question of why we can speak .
well i say , &quot; why do you think it &apos;s rubbish ? &quot;
if you look back at the early years of the last century , there was a stand-off , a lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in mendel , and the believers in darwin .
but you know , that makes me feel good , because richard dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood .
the only assistance i need from you , which i know you would do for me , are the following : one , be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust ; two , provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted ; three , receive the funds into your account in trust ; take out your commission ; and leave the rest of the money until i arrive , after the transfer is complete .
what was i going to say next ? and &quot; ze frank &quot; -- that &apos;s me .
i guess chris has to take some credit here , because in years past , i guess there &apos;s been some sort of subpar speakers at ted . i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s the third in the series .
so this is called the &quot; fiction project . &quot; this is an online space , which is -- it &apos;s basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing .
you can send them an email .
when you do this , don &apos;t attack people ; you attack tactics .
get writing .
so i make other hats as well .
maybe if i want to better relate to walls , maybe i need to be more wall-like myself . &quot;
this very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier .
levin writes that all over the world , nations are coming to terms with the fact that the social democratic welfare state is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable , dependent upon dubious economics and the demographic model of a bygone era .
they &apos;re always all siblings who are children of a single queen , so they &apos;re all in the same boat .
polarization rises .
we will never again have a political class that was forged by the experience of fighting together in world war ii against a common enemy .
so there &apos;s a lot we can do , but who &apos;s going to push them to do it ?
the left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children .
i don &apos;t think so , because it happens , not all that often , but there are a variety of examples that point the way .
this is not sustainable .
this is a violent process .
and architect christian kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city .
and finally , an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one .
tell the clocks to stop .
loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don &apos;t make sense , and if the words get jumbled up enough , it &apos;s called &quot; word salad . &quot;
&apos;we &apos;ve got to case the joint .
it &apos;s unclear whether using mechanical restraints is actually saving lives or costing lives .
he was under the impression that i had a mild psychotic illness .
it &apos;s also a very intellectually stimulating place , and occupying my mind with complex problems has been my best and most powerful and most reliable defense against my mental illness .
thank you . thank you . you &apos;re very kind .
in fact , while we drove 140,000 miles , people didn &apos;t even notice .
similar problems are emerging in the east as well .
so it &apos;s not just about the number of people ; the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don &apos;t use it .
well , we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks .
we &apos;ve returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems .
you can &apos;t be a feminist who &apos;s also interested in fashion .
and you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fmri , versus the right prefrontal cortex .
fortunately , i didn &apos;t have to look very far .
and i found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy .
the second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce .
so i &apos;m an engineer by training , but i &apos;m one of the creators and instructors of this course , which i find kind of funny , because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence .
and in closing , i want to end the same place i started , with happiness .
my first experiences , though , did come from cambodia , and at the time i remember first coming to cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the khmer rouge had killed them all .
so lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
and it &apos;s not only these justicemakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
but i &apos;m one . i can do something .
the exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...
design can be that , of course , but it can also be this .
what they do best is make a synthesis of human needs , current conditions in economy , in materials , in sustainability issues , and then what they do at the end -- if they are good -- is much more than the sum of its parts .
and also , you can imagine , a whole group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police .
many years ago i heard a mathematician from vienna , whose name was marchetti , explain how the innovation in the military industry -- therefore , secret innovation -- and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed .
so what &apos;s image got do with it ?
they talk about corruption .
and that kept him going .
swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in east africa .
my partner , m , who &apos;s a tech guru , hacked wordpress .
my sister was struggling to get through undergrad .
for most africans today , where you live , or where you were born , and the circumstances under which you were born , determine the rest of your life .
he explained this meant severe internal bleeding .
she goes village to village doing screenings .
thank you .
so when i asked him , he told me three things .
but the challenge is really for riley &apos;s future teachers , the ones she has yet to meet .
it also made all those people who roamed around the desert -- looking for water , looking for food , trying to take care of their livestock -- urbanize .
this is history being made in this region .
so a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders .
but in order to sustain the horizontal line -- because these are the projects , these are the systems that we will deliver -- we need to also develop the vertical line : system sustenance , high-level education , research and development , industries , technologies , to produce these technologies for application , and finally markets .
it helped local lech walesa to kick out one million soviet troops from poland and beginning the end of the soviet union as we know it .
whenever you see young people in front of the road trying to fraternize with the police or military , somebody was thinking about it before .
you have enthusiasm higher , you see fear starting to melt .
there are risks to be taken and there are living people who are winning the struggle .
and i said , &quot; i just told 500 people that i became a researcher to avoid vulnerability .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m just thinking about it a little bit . &quot;
there &apos;s three big answers .
then we read your book and we renamed ourselves &apos; the breakdown babes . &apos; &quot; and she said , &quot; our tagline is : &apos; we &apos;re falling apart and it feels fantastic . &apos; &quot; you can only imagine what it &apos;s like for me in a faculty meeting .
myshkin ingawale , i hope i did right by you .
when you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m going in and i &apos;m going to try this , &quot; shame is the gremlin who says , &quot; uh , uh .
it &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
but you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters ? &quot;
we want you to go in .
and it is all out of carbon fiber .
it really is a story of dr. venkataswamy .
an implicit faith in you and then you respond to it .
these are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on .
so what we did was , we gave away a lot of it for free , and then those who pay , i mean , they paid local market rates , nothing more , and often much less .
maybe there is -- the solution to the cost could be in productivity , maybe in efficiency , in the clinical process , or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables , or regulations , their defensive practice .
the first one is mass .
so in that case -- like here , there &apos;s an app that &apos;s bigger than the phone &apos;s screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you , &quot; okay , off the screen right here , there is more content .
when i started using the wheelchair , it was a tremendous new freedom .
it is the most amazing experience , beyond most other things i &apos;ve experienced in life .
the dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on .
and then gradually gentrifies .
they &apos;re doing it through an outlaw thing , the informal economy .
so the event is : we &apos;re a city planet . that just happened .
that &apos;s what drought does .
it &apos;s supposed to be , i don &apos;t know , local solar and wind and cogeneration , and good things like that .
and they increase yield , which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller , and therefore more wild area is freed up .
to put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year .
and so , robin eggs failed to hatch , songbirds died en masse , towns fell silent .
and by the way , the assumption that we can safely control the earth &apos;s awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat , making the planet not too hot , not too cold , but just right -- sort of goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy , and it &apos;s not coming from the climate scientists .
whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them , our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature -- the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer , the narrative of manifest destiny , the narrative of apocalypse and salvation .
i believe that we know this , yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop .
then , you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand .
they don &apos;t know if they &apos;ll work , and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash .
you actually just did that .
bf : first try ? once on purpose ?
dan used to actually hold them but now he &apos;s got you for protection .
one more try . man , i don &apos;t want to get too close .
bf : he invented the pencil .
we went too far .
bf : yeah . in our bio , some of you may have read that we &apos;ve won two world juggling championships .
dh : wow ! what a great trick , barry !
bf : seven-club juggling .
every one of these circles is a cog , a stack of cogs , and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive .
you &apos;re not just going to have that , so , first of all , you had sound . you had a bell , so if anything went wrong — — or the machine needed the attendant to come to it , there was a bell it could ring .
so this is what i call lovelace &apos;s leap .
that &apos;s been done . the second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build .
we know about the end of oil .
one human of six have not enough to eat in the world .
fourth i live happily because what else should i do ?
after many people said i couldn &apos;t do that .
our life is tied to the well-being of our planet .
this film has no copyright .
and perhaps because of its size , a group of people -- all , by the way , with y chromosomes -- decided they would want to sequence it .
she presents with stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer .
and what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called spr , which is responsible for producing serotonin , among other things .
none , not one .
do you think that &apos;s not going to happen ?
now , inspired by jill bolte taylor last year , i didn &apos;t bring a human brain , but i did bring a liter of bone marrow .
no robots required .
thanks .
in the branch in which the sample radiates , it sets off a trigger that releases poison and schrödinger is dead .
it &apos;s going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what &apos;s ever been done before , so we &apos;re going to get to see some new particles very soon .
and it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles .
nature always keeps a perfect balance .
this particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by pati and salam in 1973 .
filling in these new particles completes this pattern , giving us the full e8 .
as with any large investment , it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn &apos;t working out .
i mean , is there a scale to it , at the smallest scale , or ... ?
physicist and surfer garrett lisi presents a controversial new model of the universe that -- just maybe -- answers all the big questions . if nothing else , it &apos;s the most beautiful 8-dimensional model of elementary particles and forces you &apos;ve ever seen .
and young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do .
ways of controlling , preventing soil erosion .
you know , the famous scientist , e. o. wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average european or american , we need three new planets .
we seem to have lost wisdom , the wisdom of the indigenous people .
we not do have more than this one planet .
and if we care about their future , we , as the elite around the world , we can do something about it . we can make choices as to how we live each day .
and just a last word on that -- the young woman who &apos;s running this entire conference center , i met her today .
you make me go to this . you make me listen .
and so we began to work on that , for years in the &apos; 60s .
and what is interesting about that is that so many students are smart and can do it .
she never missed a day of school , k-12 .
i &apos;ll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying , &quot; i &apos;ve got this young man in class , a young black guy , and he seems like he &apos;s just not excited about the work .
i had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in birmingham to one day be president of a university that has students from 150 countries , where students are not there just to survive , where they love learning , where they enjoy being the best , where they will one day change the world .
and the bigger picture is : we need to find a way to turn off the faucet .
i guess what i want to say to everybody here -- and i know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans , but this is a problem that we &apos;ve created as consumers and we can solve .
and the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he &apos;s making so he can just go to , for example , a map of long beach , zoom in and out , etc .
in this case , the student is interested in cameras , etc .
someday i want to meet that woman when i &apos;m stronger . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s alive . i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s tortured .
now what i learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had .
i talked a lot in the past about statistics , and the provision of safe drinking water for all .
the smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers .
the lifesaver bottle works really simply .
traditionally , in a crisis , what do we do ?
thank you .
but for us , i want to talk about three factors today .
the world needs an international forum .
you see india , you see brazil .
i suspect we are now reaching the end of 400 years when western power was enough .
that was when the enemy was outside the walls .
i started with a poem , i &apos;ll end with one .
and does purpose play into it ?
play tennis too hard , on your knees , ruin your cartilage , the cartilage never comes back .
because the land is so infertile , they largely are shepherds , which occasions regular , low-intensity physical activity .
and the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us .
and typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair , or going down to arizona to play golf .
and they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity , comparatively speaking .
and predictably , perhaps , on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room .
they don &apos;t have any conveniences .
and the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe .
two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi-touch systems .
but that &apos;s not always the case .
just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge about emerging technologies is the best way to ensure that we have a say in the making of our future .
okay , so that &apos;s all you have , eyes that weren &apos;t really designed for this task , but then people ask you to do things like , you want to make a lane change , what &apos;s the first thing they ask you do ?
you &apos;ll know , because your car will know , because that other car will have whispered something in his ear , like , &quot; by the way , five minutes , motorcyclist , watch out . &quot;
how can these cars whisper , &quot; you need to get out of the way ? &quot;
i first met him through the archon x prize for genomics .
we took him out to the kennedy space center , up inside the nasa vehicle , into the back of the zero-g airplane .
they are unique . they are useful -- sometimes , often a long time after the fact .
and figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on , but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening .
medical animator david bolinsky presents 3 minutes of stunning animation that show the bustling life inside a cell .
or i washed up in public rest rooms .
the real homeless don &apos;t have hope . &quot;
the human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope .
that was wonderful , but it covered only 20 percent of the country .
if you land on anything pro-family planning , you move ahead .
of course , it must be american cola .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
imagine if they had condoms , giving out to all sorts of people .
so just don &apos;t leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses .
so anyone sitting in and watching tv , get in touch with me .
not very many of you .
now this is a free app on the app store , so if any of you guys had this app on your phones , we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together .
thanks , scott .
what is truer than truth ? answer : the story .
only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal .
i don &apos;t know .
somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive , and a few months later , she gives birth to premature twins .
feminism has never been sexy , but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting , and i have seldom suffered from lack of men .
jenny is horrified at what she has done , but then the translator explains that the patient &apos;s condition has nothing to do with the operation .
we want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody , not only for the privileged .
let &apos;s get off our fannies , roll up our sleeves and get to work , passionately , in creating an almost perfect world .
although at the same time we &apos;re losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion .
but of course not all of them were that small .
so much of london &apos;s meat was coming from the northwest , from scotland and wales .
and as you can see from these maps of london , in the 90 years after the trains came , it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot , and so on , to a large splurge , that would be very , very difficult to feed with anybody on foot , either animals or people .
and here is another very famous &quot; utopian &quot; vision , that of ebenezer howard , &quot; the garden city . &quot;
here , i deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable .
and i want us to ask now , what would ambrogio lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today ?
they &apos;re not being really strategic at all .
so they had people play this game while they were being scanned in an fmri , and two conditions : in some trials , they &apos;re told you &apos;re playing another person who &apos;s playing right now and we &apos;re going to match up your behavior at the end and pay you if you win .
that &apos;s kind of a mistake together .
remember that we scanned both brains at the same time , so we can ask about time-synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously , just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you &apos;d expect common activity in language regions when they &apos;re actually kind of listening and communicating .
so this is an amazing memory test from nagoya , japan , primate research institute , where they &apos;ve done a lot of this research .
and the rewards are apple cube rewards .
sometimes it comes in a positive version -- &quot; always treat all others as you &apos;d like to be treated yourself . &quot;
and the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate .
because we can change the world , we have the ability .
i &apos;ve always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions , but i did finally figure it out . i had to figure it out , because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector , so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would .
the primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you &apos;re not quite sure where you &apos;re going , you &apos;re certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency .
a spectacular framework , inside of which you see , usually , extraordinary blue sky .
removes some scaffolding . one of the reasons rome remains the extraordinary place it is that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric , it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself , or we find it .
then i thought , &quot; wait a minute , what am i doing ? &quot;
if it was a homing pigeon , it would be called &quot; homer &apos;s odyssey . &quot;
this pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do : it takes the scenic route , which was a device that i felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four pages .
today i &apos;d like to show you the future of the way we make things .
you decode what you want to fold up into , into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120 , negative 120 , 0 , 0 , 120 , negative 120 -- something like that ; so a sequence of angles , or turns , and you send that sequence through the string .
if you have errors , you can replace a part .
skylar tibbits : can we make things that make themselves ?
and obviously there &apos;s been tremendous practical applications associated with this world -- things like the eradication of smallpox , the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer , which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus .
i &apos;m pleased to announce that , along with colleagues at stanford and caltech and ucsf , we &apos;re currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life .
and they are . so let me start with the second one : typical . well -- is this a typical place ? well , let &apos;s look around , you know , and look in a random direction , and we see a wall , and chemical scum -- -- and that &apos;s not typical of the universe at all .
they &apos;re called &quot; quasars . &quot; quasars originally meant quasi-stellar object .
as i said , it &apos;s empty ; it &apos;s cold ; and it &apos;s dark out there . or is it ?
but i do agree with him about this . we can survive , and we can fail to survive .
so take two stone tablets , and carve on them .
so he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity , but ran into a firestorm of protest from businesses and consumers who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates .
what haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak .
so instead of forcing everyone in china to shift immediately to the market model , they proceeded by creating some special zones that could do , in a sense , what britain did : make the opportunity to go work with the market rules available to the people who wanted to opt in there .
to make it work , we need good rules . we &apos;ve already discussed that .
they want to get out .
and let these dots represent the land that &apos;s already taken up by the cities that three billion people now live in .
the reason we can be so well off , even though there is so many people on earth , is because of the power of ideas .
and maybe it &apos;s something that people in oxford don &apos;t do very often , but if you ever make it to the sea , and you swallow a mouthful of seawater , keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses .
just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was , we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition , which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes .
the pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite ; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so .
it reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours , after its chromosomes are literally blown apart .
the chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce .
life is temptation . it &apos;s all about yielding , resisting , yes , no , now , later , impulsive , reflective , present focus and future focus .
for some people it &apos;s only about what is in the immediate situation , what other people are doing and what you &apos;re feeling .
so the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past-positive gives you roots . you connect your family , identity and your self .
my question is : how many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run ?
we &apos;re finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know .
saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons .
that is the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini , and i can tell you that what we have found on titan , though it is not the same in detail , is every bit as fascinating as that story is .
and , in this case , it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet , and to come to understand a planetary system that , for all of human history , had been unreachable , and now humans had actually touched it .
and it &apos;s probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan through these channels that we saw , and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins .
my team and i have examined images like this , and like this one , and have thought about the other results from cassini .
these leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region .
they were allowed to use any force necessary .
in fact , the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced , depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention .
in 2003 , the palestinian village of budrus mounted a 10-month-long nonviolent protest to stop a barrier being built across their olive groves . did you hear about it ? didn &apos;t think so . brazilian filmmaker julia bacha asks why we only pay attention to violence in the israel-palestine conflict -- and not to the nonviolent leaders who may one day bring peace .
this is a victory of thousands of users , in hundreds of cities , one user , one edit at a time .
and place cells in their hippocampi would fire , become active , start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town .
and if you record from several grid cells -- shown here in different colors -- each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment , and each cell &apos;s grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells .
neil burgess : how your brain tells you where you are
why ? how ? what ?
we say what we do , we say how we &apos;re different or how we &apos;re better and we expect some sort of a behavior , a purchase , a vote , something like that .
dell came out with mp3 players and pdas , and they make great quality products , and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one .
or sometimes you say you &apos;re leading with your heart , or you &apos;re leading with your soul .
the difference was , orville and wilbur were driven by a cause , by a purpose , by a belief .
we all sit at various places at various times on this scale , but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea , you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration , and then the system tips .
look at tivo .
he wasn &apos;t the only man in america who suffered in a pre-civil rights america .
whether they &apos;re individuals or organizations , we follow those who lead , not because we have to , but because we want to .
and i heard the same story again and again , a story we &apos;ve heard hundreds of times since then .
how is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients , and especially low-income patients , healthy , that we didn &apos;t use it ?
and that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices , but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient , using health leads like any other sub-specialty referral .
but if we &apos;re creative , we already have that too .
when i write a prescription , i think , can the family read the prescription ?
rebecca onie asks audacious questions : what if waiting rooms were a place to improve daily health care ? what if doctors could prescribe food , housing and heat in the winter ? at tedmed she describes health leads , an organization that does just that -- and does it by building a volunteer base as elite and dedicated as a college sports team .
this is an attack on the global commons .
so here we are , 21st century .
this one , the comfort , operates throughout the caribbean and the coast of south america conducting patient treatments .
why do we want to get in these nets ?
wikipedia , every day , is tens of thousands of people inputting information , and every day millions of people withdrawing that information .
for those of you who understand computers , our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor , while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor .
and this was the portion of my brain that i lost on the morning of my stroke .
so here i am in this space , and my job -- and any stress related to my job -- it was gone .
in the meantime , for 45 minutes , the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere .
and we have the power to choose , moment by moment , who and how we want to be in the world .
also in the bible , one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality , adultery , blasphemy , idolatry , talking back to your parents -- -- and picking up sticks on the sabbath .
that &apos;s a process that seems to be continuing , but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day , things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards . so today , we get exercised -- and rightly so -- if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection in texas after a 15-year appeal process . we don &apos;t consider that a couple of hundred years ago , they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted 10 minutes , and indeed , that that would have been repeated over and over again . today , we look at capital punishment as evidence of how low our behavior can sink , rather than how high our standards have risen .
whatever its causes , the decline of violence , i think , has profound implications . it should force us to ask not just , why is there war ? but also , why is there peace ? not just , what are we doing wrong ? but also , what have we been doing right ?
