can &apos;t do much with them : put them in your pocket .
and some of those whale meat samples were whale meat .
and if we jam nutrients , sewage , fertilizer in the base of that food pyramid , it can back up all through it .
rita calwell very famously traced a very interesting story of cholera into human communities , brought there , not by a normal human vector , but by a marine vector , this copepod .
there &apos;s a tight and surprising link between the ocean &apos;s health and ours , says marine biologist stephen palumbi . he shows how toxins at the bottom of the ocean food chain find their way into our bodies , with a shocking story of toxic contamination from a japanese fish market . his work points a way forward for saving the oceans &apos; health -- and humanity &apos;s .
bj : and it has these bulkheads made out of plywood , covered with fabric -- curiously similar , in fact , to the plywood canoes that adrian &apos;s father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop .
bj : this is adrian and thys stander , who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse , and our next-door neighbor katherine , riding on a ladder .
and we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely .
over here , tommy &apos;s got what you call the heart position .
it &apos;s three heads making one character .
it &apos;s a huge driver for culture and i think that it &apos;s the most underrated force on our behavior .
so we &apos;ve provided subtitles .
poor player : how much is that ?
we &apos;ve even studied cars , not just any cars , but whether drivers of different kinds of cars are more or less inclined to break the law .
even people at the top experience these outcomes .
instead , what i want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us : the democratization of philanthropy .
the third category is represented by warren buffet , which i call aggregated giving .
whatever we call it , it &apos;s new , it &apos;s beginning , and i think it &apos;s gong to quite significant .
and something that i see happening is something that i would like to call a sort of &quot; democratization of intimacy . &quot;
they skype with their families a few times a week .
and of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concentrate and focus your attention .
you were tired , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
we have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers .
laguna seca is a legendary raceway about halfway between salinas and monterey .
this is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car in this situation .
she hired seemingly unemployable men and women to care for the bees , harvest the honey and make value-added products that they marketed themselves , and that were later sold at whole foods .
but she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain , and one that was reduced in elevation by over 2,000 feet .
they &apos;re not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse , drug and alcohol abuse , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .
and over the past 20 years , we &apos;ve spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars on social problems , yet educational outcomes , malnutrition , incarceration , obesity , diabetes , income disparity , they &apos;ve all gone up with some exceptions -- in particular , infant mortality among people in poverty -- but it &apos;s a great world that we &apos;re bringing them into as well .
and she reminded me that my favorite color was blue .
those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world , and those gay people have to discover identity later on .
she said , &quot; i knew i couldn &apos;t go in there and interrupt him , but i went home , and i left him eight messages on his cell phone . &quot;
but speaking for myself -- well , i would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born that i could come to such a point -- speaking for myself , it &apos;s made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more purposeful in my whole life , that speaking for myself , i wouldn &apos;t give it up for anything in the world . &quot;
&quot; so while i recognize that it would have been better for the world if dylan had never been born , i &apos;ve decided that it would not have been better for me . &quot;
and like all parents since the dawn of time , i wanted to protect my child from illness .
and probably , if i were to fill out jim citrin &apos;s scale , i &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
that was very important , and in some sense , we &apos;ve lost that .
even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the crank -- it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
yves showed one of the power-generating devices .
in the case of libya , it was a lot of fun meeting gaddafi in his tent .
tell people about it ! it &apos;s got to become viral , ok ?
but what i &apos;m here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues , if we apply open source collaboration .
and with every open source project , the real benefit is the interplay between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns .
i think we &apos;re sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common , and i think we &apos;re sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years , where the first few robots are starting to appear .
yeah , ok . so -- we &apos;ll leave that for later .
now they &apos;re on active duty in afghanistan every day .
there was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing , and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end .
rb : so it &apos;s expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice .
i want to show you my watch . &quot;
500 years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun ; 150 years ago , with darwin , we had to give up the idea we were different from animals .
they just fought off a king . they &apos;re not going to accept some central authority . &quot;
unfortunately , i picture it made in germany or japan , but this amazing machine that &apos;s constantly scouring every bit of human endeavor and taking resources , money , labor , capital , machinery , away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts , and while this might cause temporary dislocation , what it does is it builds up the more productive areas and lets the less productive areas fade away and die , and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient , so much richer for everybody .
reduce medicare for very wealthy seniors , seniors who make a lot of money . don &apos;t even eliminate it . just reduce it .
we get to hate each other on gun control and abortion and the environment , but on these fiscal issues , these important fiscal issues , we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say .
think of it as a tiny , tiny number of ancient economists and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process .
and he said to the guy , &quot; why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot;
and would you do me a favor ?
there &apos;s some rather bored-looking gentlemen and some slightly engaged-looking ladies who are picking up something off that .
it means something triggering a big emotional response , often quite a sad emotional response , but it &apos;s part of what we do .
and as i say , i &apos;m not a neuroscientist , but to understand how i can start to assemble things that will very quickly bypass this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements .
why would you do that ?
this is a beautiful water bottle -- some of you know of it -- done by ross lovegrove , the designer .
it wins or loses at that point .
a story , a work of art , a face , a designed object -- how do we tell that something is beautiful ? and why does it matter so much to us ? designer richard seymour explores our response to beauty and the surprising power of objects that exhibit it .
i think there are ways -- and i &apos;m being both very respectful and completely impious -- of stealing from religions .
this is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of .
religions go , &quot; nonsense .
nonsense , says the religious world view .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
and they get depressed and they get sad on their own .
really what i want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields , there is something to learn from the example of religion -- even if you don &apos;t believe any of it .
how many people here would say that religion is important to them ?
but wherever you are , as i say , if you &apos;re in the travel industry , do that travel bit .
so they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector .
and they have dedicated their lives to it .
i was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument .
thank you .
well , we don &apos;t really know , but the largest print library in the world is the library of congress . it &apos;s 26 million volumes , 26 million volumes .
and they actually come out kind of nice looking .
and i don &apos;t mean to steal any thunder here , but we &apos;ve gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader .
this is not a fax , this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job as you &apos;re going through these libraries .
so , we can do 10 cents a page , we &apos;re going 15,000 books a month and we &apos;ve got about 250,000 books online , counting all the other projects that are starting to add in .
but half of those were indian .
and we &apos;ve made a wayback machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were .
but before i show you what &apos;s inside , i will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredible things for you .
not likely .
most of you are familiar with portobello mushrooms .
and in these cavities , these micro-cavities form , and as they fuse soils , they absorb water .
420 million years ago , this organism existed .
the mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds .
we found one sample to be able to get into culture .
they gave it to the queen .
i add mycelium to it , and then i inoculate the corncobs .
we had a savanna , a marsh , a desert .
it was essentially an organic farm .
i mean , the media was making it sound like were were dying .
not only that , but i lost touch of where my food came from .
so they &apos;re all shitting each other &apos;s ponds , quite literally .
and they like to keep everything beautifully raked . and they keep all the leaves away .
jane poynter : life in biosphere 2
it was at a time when what was known you could know , you could hold it all in your head , and you could do it all .
our experience as people who get sick , need help from other people , is that we have amazing clinicians that we can turn to -- hardworking , incredibly well-trained and very smart -- that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope , but little sense that it consistently all comes together for you from start to finish in a successful way .
he didn &apos;t see it in his own patients .
an aviation checklist , like this one for a single-engine plane , isn &apos;t a recipe for how to fly a plane , it &apos;s a reminder of the key things that get forgotten or missed if they &apos;re not checked .
we all need to be pit crews now .
if this was a group of beekeepers , you would have everyone from the card-carrying nra member who &apos;s , you know , live free or die , to the , you know , the self-expressed quirky san francisco backyard pig farmer .
of course , the real importance for bees is not the honey .
they &apos;re like tiny little flies and they fly around .
and so we need to rethink this idea .
and actually , till i was 34 , i always annoyed and irritated people with whistling , because , to be honest , my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior .
and to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- i thought , well let &apos;s go back in 2005 , and i won again .
i &apos;m so sorry , technicians .
you know very well about professors .
they are training themselves , as many young animals do , to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day .
so you can recognize this kind of movement , the same movement that worms , snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display .
it &apos;s much more easy to work with plants than with animals .
we &apos;ll act as though we don &apos;t know each other .
so i got inspired by that .
but also , don &apos;t shop .
thank you .
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
thank you .
this is ted , and i want to talk about design .
i &apos;m going to use a word that pastor rick just used -- parents are stewards of their children .
what a deal .
it doesn &apos;t have to be .
this is a million people gathering on the banks of the ganges in 2001 , perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever , as seen from satellite photograph .
you &apos;ve all got a copy .
every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
and then i find this -- &quot; all the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is especially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose , a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact . &quot;
remember i quoted him before with this line -- &quot; surrendered people obey god &apos;s word , even if it doesn &apos;t make sense . &quot;
i wish this meme would go extinct .
he &apos;s saying , &quot; here &apos;s your solution . thanks very much . next . &quot;
i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two .
sound design is the future , and i think it &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to change the way the world sounds .
so i urge you to take that path .
and after about 45 minutes , you get really intricate projects like leaves sorted by hue , so you get a color fade and put in a circle like a wreath .
and so , with some ketchup , — — and then i can kind of — — and that &apos;s awesome , right ?
and i &apos;ll just hook up the forward arrow .
so this is &quot; the star-spangled banner &quot; by eating lunch , including drinking listerine .
maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets and throw it down , and maybe some chapstick , whatever .
but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
he thought nature would protect us from their formation .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
and eventually , we &apos;re going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy .
these two black holes are colliding , and they will merge over a billion-year time scale .
it &apos;s white noise ; it &apos;s such a chaotic ringing .
but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year , i simply measured and summed each of those lines .
when they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals , they &apos;re placed in immobile booths like this .
our artists are at risk .
my knife became a little sharper .
the green movement significantly inspired the world .
that implies the trusted person won &apos;t violate the trust .
it looks as though he &apos;s wishing that he didn &apos;t win .
the subject -- &quot; me &quot; -- and the object -- the scheme of things -- fuse into oneness , an experience nobody can say , &quot; i am denied of , &quot; an experience common to all and sundry .
then that again transforms into giving , into sharing .
let me act compassionately .
they told me that they preferred me on youtube than in person .
but i was excited , so i kept going .
you get hints , the actual steps for that problem , if you don &apos;t know how to do it .
we have about 90 of these right now .
and what the teacher does is literally just say , &quot; let me intervene on the red kids . &quot;
in our mind , the relevant metric is student-to-valuable-human-time- with-the-teacher ratio .
and they said , &quot; oh , this is kind of radical . we have to think about it . &quot;
the idea there is , if i &apos;m confused about a topic , somehow right in the user interface i &apos;d find people who are volunteering , maybe see their reputation , and i could schedule and connect up with those people ?
i see a white building . it &apos;s snowing , a soft snow .
i said , &quot; there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness .
but sometimes he wasn &apos;t sure whether he was hallucinating or not , because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions .
now , i don &apos;t watch sesame street , but she made a point of saying , &quot; why kermit ? &quot; she said , &quot; kermit the frog means nothing to me .
the charles bonnet ones are quite different .
you &apos;re in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images , or figments , or fragmentary figments , all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells .
and actually i &apos;m a little visually impaired myself .
and the first time i figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called deep rover .
it &apos;s phenomenal .
it &apos;s a green saber of light .
that &apos;s a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark .
now molecules are really , really tiny .
if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands , you see these things that look like teeth .
when the cell feels it &apos;s ready to go , it rips apart the chromosome .
exploring at the frontier of science , at the frontier of human understanding , is mind-blowing .
many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi-literate .
in selecting a subject in which to conduct original research , or to develop world-class expertise , take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited .
the decades ahead will see dramatic advances in disease prevention , general health , the quality of life .
and the way the drug gets tested is through a series of , basically , experiments , through these large , they &apos;re called trials , that they do to determine whether the drug is safe and whether it works and all these things .
in fact , that early stage of the funding process , that phase i and pre-clinical stuff , that &apos;s actually , in the industry , called the valley of death because it &apos;s where drugs go to die .
that &apos;s right in the investment sweet spot of pension funds and 401 plans and all this other stuff .
so i &apos;d like to think it was a good sign .
did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families ?
neither one wants to be the first one or they &apos;re going to get the sucker &apos;s payoff , but both lose , of course , because they don &apos;t get what they want .
i &apos;m moving very quickly over a number of disciplines . in biology , the notions of symbiosis , group selection , evolutionary psychology are contested , to be sure .
millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they &apos;re not using them to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers -- that &apos;s folding @ home at stanford -- to crack codes , to search for life in outer space .
so , as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of sim city-like virtual view at 45 degrees .
and from here , we &apos;re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
when you use it on the spot , it means that you &apos;re able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you .
i &apos;ll never do it again . &quot;
and people said yes , and they built with these legos .
now what happens when you compare these two conditions ?
and this was a group within this software company that was put in a different building .
and we had three conditions .
ignoring gets you a whole way out there .
they took the eggs and the milk out of the powder .
when you looked at the hard instructions , the effect was larger .
karl marx , on the other hand , said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing .
and my parents were told by the khmer rouge to evacuate the city because of impending american bombing for three days .
and my mother &apos;s vietnamese was so bad that to make our story more credible , she &apos;d given all the boys and girls new vietnamese names .
and people had hope , yes , but until they realized their situation worsens every day -- either because they are being killed or because , somehow , they are poorer than eight years ago .
somebody has to feel how you felt .
so this makes us very happy , because now we also have some evidence that this is working .
we &apos;ll use biofuels . problem solved .
top right , bahrain has the same energy consumption per person , roughly , as canada , over 300 light bulbs per person , but their population density is a factor of 300 times greater , 1,000 people per square kilometer .
remember where we are , 1.25 watts per square meter , wind farms 2.5 , solar parks about five .
in addition to those levers , we could talk about other ways of solving this issue , namely , we could reduce demand , and that means reducing population — i &apos;m not sure how to do that — or reducing per capita consumption .
i was writing a book about sustainable energy , and a friend asked me , &quot; well how much energy do you use at home ? &quot; and i was embarrassed . i didn &apos;t actually know .
i had received a donation of 50 music stands to be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal .
the structure of el sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region , and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class all over venezuela .
a few years ago , historian arnold toynbee said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis .
in fact , they &apos;re not : it &apos;s really a very , very high-resolution input medium -- you have to just do it twice , you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly -- and you can move a cursor with great accuracy .
in fact , they funded it for that very reason .
the words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words , so i can get a different definition by just touching the word , and the definition appears , superimposed over the illustration .
the principal said , &quot; there &apos;s a dreadful mistake , because that child can &apos;t read .
i will come to my last example and then quit .
and they &apos;re not embarrassed by a meds caddy that &apos;s ugly , that sits on their kitchen table and says , &quot; i &apos;m old . i &apos;m frail . &quot;
so , these are what i would call behavioral markers .
the health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that &apos;s coming , and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care , but deliver care in some radically different ways .
and just as 30 years ago we couldn &apos;t conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts , that we &apos;re carrying around in our cell phone today , and suddenly , computing , that used to be an expert driven system , it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives -- that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare .
i want to give you a couple of examples . this is mimi from one of our studies -- in her 90s , had to move out of her home because her family was worried about falls .
these discoveries of behavioral markers , and behavioral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we &apos;ve actually never done before .
how do we set a going-to-the-moon goal of dealing with the y2k + 10 problem that &apos;s coming ?
you can go online and buy a hacking service to knock your business competitor offline .
now how do you get a usb key to run in a business ?
it creates some very serious alerts .
a little more searching , and here &apos;s our cybercriminal .
my home network , prettyflyforawifi , which i think is a great name .
countries do not agree , which makes this area exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective .
so it was pretty interesting stuff .
and one of my former doctoral students , dr. mary schweitzer , actually had the background to do this sort of thing .
she took the bone , and she dumped it into acid .
avian dinosaurs are our modern birds .
and that &apos;s pretty cool .
but the cool thing is that , if you look in the embryo , as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand .
i went to my school kitchen , and i said , &quot; give me the scraps that my school friends have turned their noses up at . &quot;
the fact is , we have an enormous buffer in rich countries between ourselves and hunger .
i certainly haven &apos;t .
in our homes , we &apos;ve lost touch with food .
you just press it .
one dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life .
and i think that djabran fluctus , that fits that mode .
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful eugene . you could make maps of toronto . &quot;
which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads .
once again , these guys rock it out .
they are so different .
moleeds are what i believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved .
it just seems like it &apos;s not sexy and elegant , it &apos;s hidden .
in a presentation that can only be described as epic , comedian charles fleischer delivers a hysterical send-up of a time-honored theme : the map . geometry , numbers , charts and stamp art also factor in , as he weaves together a unique theory of everything called &quot; moleeds . &quot;
and that means that it &apos;s vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen , or certain kinds of deliberate attacks , but even the mistakes can be bad .
and so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other .
regarding cyberattacks against the american company google .
okay , but what distinguishes it from an offensive unit ?
so nations may live under the threat of what nobel prize winner thomas schelling called the &quot; reciprocal fear of surprise attack , &quot; as i don &apos;t know if my neighbor is about to attack me or not -- i may never know -- so i might take the upper hand and attack first .
this is what i saw . i saw hills and valleys .
but it &apos;s easy to see why these animals make such great cartoon characters , their shapes and sizes .
or this lionfish for instance .
he wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride , which doesn &apos;t really work in voice balloons very well .
you really don &apos;t have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because , if you start with a talking shark , readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door .
and that &apos;s what i hope my comic strip does in a small way .
well , isolation has been the great saving grace of this remarkable place , but today isolation could be its doom .
you sir , that &apos;s three , and anybody on this side here ?
anyone i point to , call out a three-digit number .
i can probably do it .
did you leave out the number 7 ?
anyway , chris , you can help me out here , if you wouldn &apos;t mind .
audience : seven . seven .
in a lively show , mathemagician arthur benjamin races a team of calculators to figure out 3-digit squares , solves another massive mental equation and guesses a few birthdays . how does he do it ? he &apos;ll tell you .
and if you look at it over here , the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future .
but what i &apos;ve just made -- and i &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
and i &apos;ll just say what i &apos;m about to do . what i &apos;m about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this hewlett-packard oscilloscope .
and there &apos;s no time to do it .
0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
there &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
so where does this lead ?
so we want things that nest , we want things that stack , and we want it digitized .
it &apos;s got to be serious if the new york times puts a cover story of their february 17th sunday magazine about play .
the texas tower murderer opened my eyes , in retrospect , when we studied his tragic mass murder , to the importance of play , in that that individual , by deep study , was found to have severe play deprivation .
this happens to be ok -- he &apos;s an anatomically interested little boy and that &apos;s his mom . other situations wouldn &apos;t be quite so good .
the animal world has objectified it .
and therefore , the most playful .
because when you put it on , you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting .
br : and we &apos;re chefs . so when moto opened in 2004 , people didn &apos;t really know what to expect . a lot of people thought that it was a japanese restaurant , and maybe it was the name , maybe it was the logo , which was like a japanese character , but anyway , we had all these requests for japanese food , which is really not what we did . and after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll , we decided to give the people what they wanted . so this picture is an example of printed food , and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation . so this is all the ingredients , all the flavor of , you know , a standard maki roll , printed onto a little piece of paper .
br : yeah , that &apos;s our chef de cuisine , chris jones . this is not the only guy that just flips out when we assign a ridiculous task , but a lot of these ideas , they &apos;re hard to understand .
br : yeah , so you can imagine , a task like this -- this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for . but we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general , because these are ingredients , you know , plant life that we &apos;re , one , unfamiliar with , and two , we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don &apos;t eat them .
one reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half .
where &apos;s art ? i got productivity . i got sports .
maluma is on top . yeah . so .
okay . so ...
so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them .
it &apos;s always kind of doing a double take : &quot; what ? &quot;
this is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these viruses into human populations , the movement of these agents over into humans ; and by capturing this moment , we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early .
they show us filter paper they &apos;ve used to collect the animals &apos; blood .
paul worked for years on the cameroonian national radio and television , and he spoke about health issues . he was a health correspondent .
so , once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring , we decided to move this from research , to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort .
you say what you &apos;re doing in 140 characters or less , and people who are interested in you get those updates .
we currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software that can send twitter updates -- interfaces for mac , windows , your iphone , your blackberry -- as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby twitter when it kicks or a plant twitter when it needs water .
evan williams : nice . thanks .
they stirred my imagination . they opened up new worlds for me .
in this single story there was no possibility of africans being similar to her in any way , no possibility of feelings more complex than pity , no possibility of a connection as human equals .
the political climate in the u.s. at the time was tense , and there were debates going on about immigration .
but i also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps .
shortly after he published my first novel i went to a tv station in lagos to do an interview , and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said , &quot; i really liked your novel . i didn &apos;t like the ending .
chimamanda ngozi adichie : the danger of a single story
but what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps , that within these camps , a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition , that experts move with the prevailing winds , often hero-worshipping their own gurus .
and that &apos;s why i talk about the need to actively manage dissent .
i &apos;m eating right , i &apos;m exercising every day , i &apos;m keeping my mind active , that &apos;s what the research says you should do .
because the more things that are familiar , the more things my hands know how to do , the more things that i can be happy and busy doing when my brain &apos;s not running the show anymore .
about six months later i figured out it must be hydrogen , until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth , which is , you actually use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside a car , if you use hydrogen .
you drive . you take your depleted battery out .
but e-miles follow moore &apos;s law .
and denmark set this beautiful policy ; it &apos;s called the iq test .
that &apos;s another 30 percent demand on oil .
we forgot about the entire chain around us .
let &apos;s not do it immediately . maybe we free the kids and keep the slaves .
the arguments of so-called id theorists are the same old arguments that had been refuted again and again , since darwin down to the present day .
it has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge .
&quot; no , i don &apos;t know that atheists should be considered citizens , nor should they be considered patriots .
the survey that i quoted , which is the aris survey , didn &apos;t break down its data by socio-economic class or education , iq or anything else .
i suspect that the word &quot; atheist &quot; itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means , and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves .
so , how about &quot; humanist &quot; ?
richard dawkins urges all atheists to openly state their position -- and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science . a fiery , funny , powerful talk .
and again , here , you see barbie.com , but also , very quickly , adiosbarbie.com , the body image for every size . a contested cultural object , which you won &apos;t find anywhere soon on overture , which is the classic market-based mechanism : whoever pays the most is highest on the list .
this is the africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies .
in fact , if you &apos;re not in nigeria , you &apos;re not in africa .
and we could hardly even pay anything , any salaries , in the economy .
this is better than the performance of many oecd countries .
ngozi okonjo-iweala : want to help africa ? do business here
but first , i have to explain why they &apos;re important because vaccines , the power of them , is really like a whisper .
without a vaccine , these responses would have taken more than a week .
the vaccine effort though is really quite different .
so for instance , a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza , as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus .
so today , we get our flu vaccines from ...
now think of where this leads us .
you also can use adjuvants , which are chemicals you mix .
so here &apos;s the first punch line : cities have defused the population bomb .
helping africa is noble .
let &apos;s move on , and flip over to the next chapter , and that &apos;s what this conference is all about -- the next chapter .
by raking it off the backs of their suffering people .
the first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous , so they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with any centralized authority .
kano , salaga -- they were all there .
the modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed .
think about it for a second : there is no standard google anymore .
you know we all want to be someone who has watched &quot; rashomon , &quot; but right now we want to watch &quot; ace ventura &quot; for the fourth time .
as web companies strive to tailor their services to our personal tastes , there &apos;s a dangerous unintended consequence : we get trapped in a &quot; filter bubble &quot; and don &apos;t get exposed to information that could challenge or broaden our worldview . eli pariser argues powerfully that this will ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy .
but i was thinking that since i plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to ted , that maybe i could talk about that another time .
be a green consumer . you have choices with everything you buy , between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis .
we have to change the minds of the american people . because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done .
beyond warming , we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified -- and already measurably so , and already affecting animals .
if you go to the place where the oil has been a while , it &apos;s an even bigger mess .
turtles eat it . it gets in the gills of fish .
down on the lower left there are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings .
these birds make a living by diving into the water .
we &apos;ve been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling .
well it doesn &apos;t break even .
i &apos;ve got brown eyes ; you might have blue or gray .
this is the connectome of the worm c. elegans .
and we can do that for another neuron in green .
so when show my friends this , sometimes they &apos;ve told me , &quot; you know , sebastian , you should just give up .
well , it &apos;s true .
consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements , like a pianist playing a beethoven sonata .
should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality , calling them fools ?
as you &apos;re seeing this gel magnet for the first time , if you assume that all magnets had to be hard , then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work .
so i just want to quickly explain how this would work .
right there . that &apos;s great .
but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game . so during halftime , it could rain down on the players , cool everyone down , and in a matter of minutes it would dry . wouldn &apos;t hurt the court .
don &apos;t let milk spoil your morning .
zach kaplan + keith schacht : toys and materials from the future
so several months ago , a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
couldn &apos;t find a shred of evidence .
so i hushed my voice .
upgrades the life for these geese .
so i &apos;m listening to all this , you know , and i &apos;m like , is this guy for real ? is he making some of this up ?
they don &apos;t need anything more . &quot;
there &apos;s 100 percent star anise in there .
what the hell does that mean ?
mega-farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long-distance travel , food processing .
thank you .
three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings .
indeed , that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper .
they are all-american , carbon-free and inexhaustible .
and deutsche bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016 .
and those can all be made more efficient , and the motors that turn them can have their system efficiency roughly doubled by integrating 35 improvements , paying back in about a year .
in fact in this country , no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital , despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies .
at about the same cost as business as usual , this would maximize national security , customer choice , entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation .
and but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure , this new fire is flameless .
bihar represents the challenge of development : abject poverty surrounded by corruption .
so for instance , several governments in africa and eastern europe are opening their budgets to the public .
thank you .
and to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth , i must imagine : who owns this mouth ?
fantastic ! it &apos;s a beauty !
if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go , &quot; i see you , oh my god you are here , how are you , i can help you , i can design for you a new toothbrush , new toilet brush , &quot; something like that .
this line of evolution is clearly positive .
this scenario , of this civilization , was about becoming powerful , intelligent , like this idea we have invented , this concept of god .
twenty-two people are graduating , and all 22 are going to college .
because for the majority of my adult life , i worked with young kids , teenagers with guns , i call them .
let &apos;s get it all online . &quot;
if you &apos;re not at the right reading level at third grade , you are a candidate for jail at age 18 , and we have the highest incarceration rate because we &apos;re not getting our kids the proper start in life .
if we don &apos;t give that gift to each and every one of our kids , if we don &apos;t invest at the earliest age , we &apos;re going to be running into difficulties .
and so , it &apos;s so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families , all families .
but i gotta have my hot dog .
hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now , 24 / 7 .
traditional business wisdom holds that trust is earned by predictable behavior , but when everything is consistent and standardized , how do you create meaningful experiences ?
because everyone was a hero .
khaled saeed was killed in june 2010 .
but actually when people went to the street -- the first time it was thousands of people in alexandria -- it felt like -- it was amazing . it was great because it connected people from the virtual world , bringing them to the real world , sharing the same dream , the same frustration , the same anger , the same desire for freedom .
extremism became tolerance .
and you &apos;ll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language .
english has a lot of rs and ls .
it takes a human being for babies to take their statistics .
let me demonstrate this based on three projects .
that &apos;s because the ferrofluid itself is hydrophobic .
those three projects , they &apos;re based on very simple scientific phenomena , such as magnetism , the sound waves , or over here , the physical properties of a substance , and what i &apos;m trying to do is i &apos;m trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way , and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us .
the rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned .
but the conditions for compassion to be activated , to be aroused , are particular conditions .
in buddhism , we say , &quot; it takes a strong back and a soft front . &quot;
joan halifax : compassion and the true meaning of empathy
in fact , here &apos;s another one .
if you divide 13 by eight , you get 1.625 .
but what &apos;s interesting is , i &apos;ve never had trouble traveling in any other western countries with my american passport , even though it says , &quot; born in iran . &quot; no problems .
if i want the money , why would i kill myself ? &quot;
but i kept watching the news in case they came back , they were like , &quot; before he did it , he converted to islam . &quot;
for example , i took my two year-old son to the playground at the dubai mall .
a founding member of the axis of evil comedy tour , standup comic maz jobrani riffs on the challenges and conflicts of being iranian-american -- &quot; like , part of me thinks i should have a nuclear program ; the other part thinks i can &apos;t be trusted ... &quot;
mt : deception , it &apos;s a fundamental part of life .
our self-deception becomes a positive illusion -- why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures ; why we believe romeo when he says he loves juliet ; and why single notes of music , when played together , become a sonata and conjure up meaning .
they teach us about what happens in the complex organism .
we use techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to make these structures at a scale relevant to both the cells and their environment .
yeah . mucus . yuck .
is it excreted in your kidneys ?
it does something else that &apos;s very important .
and they drew a list of people with whom they would talk , and tell their story .
because they had no idea .
the second one is the privatization of terrorism .
it has happened with industrial revolution .
now , many of you know that the patriot act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of americans in order to protect them against terrorism .
four years ago , i rowed solo across the atlantic , and since then , i &apos;ve done two out of three stages across the pacific , from san francisco to hawaii and from hawaii to kiribati .
oars are your only means of propulsion .
mostly , a baseball cap , rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown , depending on whether i went backwards overnight -- and lots of sun lotion .
fall down nine times , get up 10 .
this is big trouble for these guys .
anything that we do spreads ripples .
i get sick . you get sick .
clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate , so if we &apos;re going to look at a new drug , right , we test it in people , we draw blood , we do experiments , and we gain consent for that study , to make sure that we &apos;re not screwing people over as part of it .
and that sucks , right ? so 45 percent of men develop cancer . thirty-eight percent of women develop cancer .
so that means , if you &apos;re a geneticist , you &apos;re freaking out , going , &quot; oh my god , you told everyone you carry the apoe e4 allele . what &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
and those correlations that they can tease out , they &apos;re not necessarily causal agents , but math , in this day and age , is like a giant set of power tools that we &apos;re leaving on the floor , not plugged in in health , while we use hand saws .
so what i &apos;d end &#91; with &#93; is , the most beautiful thing i &apos;ve learned since i quit my job almost a year ago to do this , is that it really doesn &apos;t take very many of us to achieve spectacular results .
i don &apos;t remember , in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture , a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning , fire exiting , safety concerns and whether carpet burns .
so , in the american tradition , the difference between the technocratic and the romantic , would be the difference between thomas jefferson &apos;s cartesian grids spreading across the united states , that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the united states , as a really , truly , technocratic solution , a bowing to the -- in jefferson &apos;s time -- current , popular philosophy of rationalism .
what &apos;s interesting about it is how it &apos;s made . how it &apos;s made .
only one of whom had ever seen the plans before .
every single surface of this restaurant is white .
boo hewerdine , thomas dolby , thank you very much for inviting me . it &apos;s been a blessing singing for you .
and they said , &quot; don &apos;t be stupid . &quot;
he got his paper back expecting a near-perfect score , and couldn &apos;t believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero .
to this day , despite a loving husband , she doesn &apos;t think she &apos;s beautiful because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half her face .
why else would we still be here ?
we &apos;ve made a system which is basically a live production machine , a real-time music production machine , and it enables me to , using nothing but my voice , create music in real time as i hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me .
why do this ?
tomorrow is another day .
here we go .
if i stand beside that truck , my head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap .
so far , this is enough toxin to cover the face of lake eerie a foot deep .
just 70 miles downstream is the world &apos;s largest freshwater delta , the peace-athabasca delta , the only one at the juncture of all four migratory flyways .
because what we do here is going to change our history , it &apos;s going to color our possibility to survive , and for our children to survive and have a rich future .
these comics are a fundamental way that children , especially in the diaspora , learn their religious and mythological folk tales .
he was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases , paintings of everyday objects , the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every indian .
right . now , when -- it &apos;s interesting that when we look at an image we see , you know , color , depth , texture . and you can look at this whole scene and analyze it . you can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth . but the whole thing is actually flat . it &apos;s painted . it &apos;s trompe l &apos;oeil .
and this is what happens to that food web when it &apos;s stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before .
because simple answers may emerge .
now , i want to take this problem seriously .
just 30 minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long-term increases in happiness .
now , why a game ?
i mean , if it hadn &apos;t worked for me , there &apos;s no way i would have believed it was possible .
so here &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
so good job . quest number three .
here &apos;s one more secret for you : shaking someone &apos;s hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream , now that &apos;s the trust hormone .
when game designer jane mcgonigal found herself bedridden and suicidal following a severe concussion , she had a fascinating idea for how to get better . she dove into the scientific research and created the healing game , superbetter . in this moving talk , mcgonigal explains how a game can boost resilience -- and promises to add 7.5 minutes to your life .
now i say &quot; naively &quot; because actually my profession is as a science writer .
it &apos;s almost impossible to model this structure any other way , and it &apos;s almost impossible to do it on computers .
i have a straight line on my spherical surface .
i can touch it . i can play with it . &quot;
just as the morphology and the complexity of life on earth is never ending , little embellishments and complexifications in the dna code lead to new things like giraffes , or orchids -- so too , do little embellishments in the crochet code lead to new and wondrous creatures in the evolutionary tree of crochet life .
it can contemplate the meaning of infinity and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity .
i &apos;m not saying i believe this , but this is the standard freudian view .
or terror , as the case may be ? right ?
ok , now the next question is , what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments ?
but that costs millions of dollars .
he said , &quot; no , last three days , i &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away .
well , there are many theories .
all of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia , we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging , and by studying patients and asking the right questions .
and i don &apos;t really think it &apos;s in our biology ; i think we &apos;ve attributed it to our biology , but i don &apos;t really think it &apos;s there .
we need more sticks , too .
it means &quot; star &quot; in swahili .
ss : she &apos;s also saying the name of that , with her voice .
this environment brings out unexpected potential in kanzi and panbanisha .
because we believe that it &apos;s not biology ; it &apos;s culture .
each is a galaxy , fully like ours or andromeda , which looks so small and faint because its light has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us .
you want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small , but we want to understand the very complex .
and even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence .
and it &apos;ll be another six billion before that happens , and any remaining life on earth is vaporized .
the planet became an intense emitter of radio waves -- the total output from all tv and cell phones and radar transmissions . and something else happened .
this article &apos;s about how their lives get ruined .
so we gave some examples of what you could spend it on .
we wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries .
they had no money , they went to a clinic and i gave her this money . &quot;
so these are sales teams in belgium .
the teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percentages as they were before .
yet , rabin referred to iran as a geostrategic friend .
so israel , who in the 1980s lobbied for and improved u.s.-iran relations now feared a u.s.-iran rapprochement , thinking that it would come at israel &apos;s security interests &apos; expense , and instead sought to put iran in increased isolation .
some believe or say that it &apos;s 1938 , iran is germany , and ahmadinejad is hitler .
the judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars .
here focusing in on haiti .
you don &apos;t necessarily have to win , but you must do extremely well .
they become , in the words of &quot; the x-files , &quot; shape-shifters , as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money , not on issues one to 10 , but on issues 11 to 1,000 .
it blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about .
climate change is mine , but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality .
you don &apos;t wake up one day no longer a racist .
do you have that love ?
it provoked the missile gap .
there &apos;s no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time .
maybe no one &apos;s really crazy .
this is from a bbc show called &quot; predators , &quot; and what we &apos;re looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense .
information can be sent over half a kilometer away in a very short time through this mechanism .
but i hope you &apos;ve convinced yourself now , with this nighttime video , that they really were very well synchronized .
let &apos;s see if we can get this to work .
it was at least six , six to eight inches , i would have thought .
we &apos;d spent a lot of time designing this bridge , and we &apos;d analyzed it , we &apos;d checked it to codes -- to heavier loads than the codes -- and here it was doing something that we didn &apos;t know about .
they &apos;re all having some difficulty walking .
i wouldn &apos;t tell them what it was , but it was in alphabetical order , and i would tell them to look for their names , their family names , their mother &apos;s maiden name .
if agriculture hasn &apos;t experienced that , how could it be adapted ?
it &apos;s otherworldly , beautiful .
because i challenge you to think of an effective , efficient , sustainable solution to climate change if we don &apos;t have crop diversity .
this is male blogging posture sitting , and the result is , &quot; for greater comfort , men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women , when working on laptop .
yossi vardi : this is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year , known as the optical inch by philips . let &apos;s applaud philips -- -- for this gesture for humanity .
and there was a wonderful little short four-year time period when marvelous things happened .
we &apos;ve lost that capability . we abandoned it in &apos; 72 .
it &apos;ll be very high volume ; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020 .
what &apos;s out there is there &apos;s something really interesting going to happen here .
i predict , also , that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the u.s. taxpayer spends for nasa &apos;s manned spacecraft work .
i had to learn the language .
they use techniques that he &apos;s never heard of , and for his half a million dollars in prize money , rob mcewen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold .
and there are all kinds of famous stories about this .
well , these wiki revolutions happen so fast they create a vacuum , and politics abhors a vacuum , and unsavory forces can fill that , typically the old regime , or extremists , or fundamentalist forces .
and scientists that have studied this have said they &apos;ve never seen an accident .
for example , in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood ; in the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange ; in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation ; and in nerves they course along like power lines , keeping those nerves alive .
so the body &apos;s ability to balance angiogenesis , when it &apos;s working properly , prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers .
so we created an antiangiogenic paste .
the active ingredient &apos;s resveratrol , it &apos;s also found in red wine .
so this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels can impact on cancer .
do you recommend pursuing these treatments now , for most cancer patients ?
i thought this was a great assignment .
i consider that puzzles are an art form .
here &apos;s the word &quot; mirror . &quot; no , it &apos;s not the same upside-down .
here is another thing you can do .
you know , he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon .
i &apos;ll explain what that means . we &apos;re looking at three trends .
i &apos;ll play as fast as i can .
how do we bring up boys ? what does it mean to be a boy ?
and he would actually say , while he was beating me , &quot; don &apos;t you cry . don &apos;t you dare cry . &quot;
the burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings , which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers .
and she made a decision as many women do across this planet , that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls .
agnes took her in , and agnes loved her , and agnes supported her for the year .
oh , i know when your girlfriend &apos;s really pissed off , even though she appears to give you what you want .
you don &apos;t tell the atlantic ocean to behave .
the picture that we best can determine was probably the one that they were shown in the photo array is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots .
remember , the investigating officers &apos; report said the lighting was good .
three to four feet , it might as well have been a football field away .
scott fraser : why eyewitnesses get it wrong
so i got a fulbright scholarship to just travel around africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals , which is a great job if you can get it .
i started collecting aerial photographs of native american and south pacific architecture ; only the african ones were fractal .
well , you see self-organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game .
when you have a four-bit symbol , you then put it together with another one sideways .
self-organization is why the aids virus is spreading so fast .
the starrs are a regular american family with their share of regular american family problems .
it highlighted toyota and canon and likened their adaptable , tight-knit teams to rugby scrums .
everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on .
parents can learn a lot from that .
be flexible , be open-minded , let the best ideas win .
the point is , we have to let our children succeed on their own terms , and yes , on occasion , fail on their own terms .
and we didn &apos;t really know what to do , so we called her into my office .
when leo tolstoy was five years old , his brother nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick , which he had hidden in a ravine on the family &apos;s estate in russia .
when you have nanotechnology and nanoscience , what &apos;s occurred is that we &apos;re able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits .
you guys didn &apos;t hear about us cutting out the design from ted ?
yeah , stuff like that was in the movie and she &apos;s promoting it .
mt : and when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination , he would build them in his workshop .
mt : nikola tesla died on the 7th of january , 1943 .
he said , actually , that he believed the job of the painter was to paint everything that was visible and invisible in the universe .
leonardo himself had preached against the use of gold , so it was absolutely anathema at that moment .
they had this kind of odd sort of fascination , like a car accident .
it &apos;s not an escapism that we feel particularly happy with today , however .
so i loved , on an art historical level , i loved that layered quality that he has .
and when things work well , then the nervous system works well , and everything functions .
this boy is nine years old , perfectly normal until the age six , and then he started twisting his body , first the right foot , then the left foot , then the right arm , then the left arm , then the trunk , and then by the time he arrived , within the course of one or two years of the disease onset , he could no longer walk , he could no longer stand .
they shut down . they turn off .
well , many biologists will tell engineers , and others , organisms have millions of years to get it right ; they &apos;re spectacular ; they can do everything wonderfully well .
because it &apos;s very interesting . when you take this model and you perturb it , you give it a push , as it bumps into something , it self-stabilizes , with no brain or no reflexes , just by the structure alone .
here &apos;s the first example of that . this is the stanford shape deposition manufactured robot , named sprawl .
it &apos;s a see-through treadmill with a see-through treadmill belt , so we can watch the animal &apos;s feet , and videotape them through the treadmill belt , to see how they move .
we also presented to nike even .
so , we got the whole thermodynamics department at stanford involved -- a lot of computational fluid dynamics .
and he said , &quot; no , we &apos;ve been here about a year . &quot;
he reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures , marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored .
and he gave the case out , both of them , to two groups of students .
here &apos;s what happens : we &apos;re all busy . everyone &apos;s busy . a woman &apos;s busy .
i have two children .
it &apos;s the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system .
so fear showed up as not really the driver .
we need to connect the information always with the action , and then that action feeds back into different information , and it creates , of course , a feedback loop .
this is a pharmaceutical ad .
they &apos;re packed with information .
they have this huge amount of space , and they don &apos;t use it for anything , so we do .
so i want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask , because i don &apos;t actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports .
and there was a day about seven years ago : i was planting potatoes , it was the first week of may -- this is new england , when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom ; they &apos;re just white clouds above .
and so by getting us to mow the lawn , we keep the trees from coming back , which in new england happens very , very quickly .
and they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine .
it &apos;s a very elaborate and beautiful dance , but i &apos;m going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it , and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens , his laying hens .
but look at it from the point of view of the grass , now .
and he kind of nodded , you know ?
and then after a few years , we got cd-quality sound .
you feel for them .
it has 10 variations .
so they &apos;d go to an antique shop , and they &apos;d look at this cup , and they &apos;d say , &quot; tell us about this cup . &quot;
because in many senses , a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes .
so these kind of systems , i believe , are important .
and the tools , the resources that we use to build a game layer are game dynamics themselves .
four . back at scvngr , we like to joke that with seven game dynamics , you can get anyone to do anything .
but this could also be used for good .
there are levels . there are c. there are b. there is a .
it can also be used in very compelling ways for good .
and the winner was actually a group out of mit , where they created sort of a pyramid scheme , a network , where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $ 2,000 and anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut of it .
and every one of those rising dots represents probably about 20 , 30 searches , or something like that .
you can see that it got started right here .
we just released it in a test phase last month , and it &apos;s been taking off .
we would never do such a crazy thing , but -- in any case , we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them , that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be .
along with our logos , too , which i think really embody our culture when we change things .
and so basically , he thought he was dealing with something smart , we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out , and it didn &apos;t quite work , and we don &apos;t have this feature anymore .
and i &apos;d like to suggest that if we take a different view of design , and focus less on the object and more on design thinking as an approach , that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact .
and that &apos;s happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems -- to global warming , to education , healthcare , security , clean water , whatever .
these are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts .
and that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society -- how we keep ourselves healthy , how we govern ourselves , how we educate ourselves , how we keep ourselves secure .
and if you &apos;ve got any ideas then feel free , you can post them to twitter .
but from the japanese perspective , it &apos;s their duty to protect those who don &apos;t know any better -- in this case , the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice .
the first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents &apos; approach to choice .
compare this to the die-hard devotion of many americans , not just to a particular flavor of soda , but to a particular brand .
choice no longer offers opportunities , but imposes constraints .
french parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; noah was here for so little time , but he taught us so much .
but joseph brodsky said that , &quot; it is poetry that is gained in translation , &quot; suggesting that translation can be a creative , transformative act .
and the only thing they had consensus on : well , if i could see them , i would clearly be able to tell them apart .
and , playing , i realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing , and i could avoid an obstacle at the very last second , more maneuverable than a normal boat .
you want everybody , like we &apos;re doing now , to work at the same time , and that can only happen if these people all together decide to share the information , and that &apos;s exactly what open hardware is about .
so , this small machine that you &apos;ve seen , we &apos;re hoping to make small toys like one-meter remote control protei that you can upgrade -- so replace the remote control parts by androids , so the mobile phone , and arduino micro-controller , so you could be controlling this from your mobile phone , your tablet .
girl 4 : i wouldn &apos;t like it .
we promise something great , we evangelize it , we &apos;re going to change the world . it doesn &apos;t work out too well , and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again , as the people in new york and l.a. look on in absolute , morbid astonishment .
we &apos;re threatened by the greatest weapon ever , and knowing a good thing when it sees it , the air force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us .
so -- and we haven &apos;t even worked out the cooling needs .
those are the winky dink crayons . i know what you &apos;re saying .
and so the global village is as big as a planet , and as small as a village post office .
feed your head , feed your head , feed your head . &quot;
the year is 1993 and he was working on a book and i was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this .
we &apos;ll see channels for the gourmet and we &apos;ll see channels for the pet lover .
obviously , we hope that the strike is -- that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible .
and so every time a new medium arrives , the old medium is the content , and it is highly observable , highly noticeable , but the real , real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium , and it is ignored .
but there were lots of other things going on in this area : it was a kind of construction zone ; a lot of buildings were going up .
color can animate simple blocks , simple materials : walking in new york , i &apos;ll stop .
i walk to work every day or ride my scooter , and i come down and park in this little spot .
and the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional .
but it built a romance .
eventually hired myself out as a designer .
and i felt , the one thing they don &apos;t need , is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there .
or you can pull them up where you want them .
so that part of it took a long time to work out .
now the odd thing is , is that once you &apos;ve been bitten by this mosquito , and you &apos;ve had this disease , your body develops antibodies , so if you &apos;re bitten again with that strain , it doesn &apos;t affect you .
this is really unpleasant stuff , and if it was any good , we wouldn &apos;t have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn &apos;t have this massive increase in dengue fever .
and if you can put more , i &apos;ll call them sterile , that the offspring will actually die at different stages , but i &apos;ll call them sterile for now .
both have a side benefit , which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously .
well , it can mean a lot of things .
if you &apos;ve been there , you know what i &apos;m talking about .
did you know that data existed ?
where you live : it impacts your health as much as diet and genes do , but it &apos;s not part of your medical records . at tedmed , bill davenhall shows how overlooked government geo-data can mesh with mobile gps apps to keep doctors in the loop . call it &quot; geo-medicine . &quot;
they take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad .
why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture ?
and the question is a simple one : do we have enough phosphorus to feed our future generations ?
as you can see , they meet in 2030 , i &apos;ll be retired by then .
it will proliferate between the root &apos;s cells , eventually penetrating a cell and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure , which will considerably increase the exchange interface between the plant and the mushroom .
people like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem .
so , a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields : whether it &apos;s automobiles , architecture , products , etc . , it &apos;s really being affected by this digital medium of curvature .
we also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum , so it &apos;s all one continuous change in the massing , but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms .
instead , we want to feed them more vegetable proteins .
imagine that was lake huron .
so without a doubt , agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age . no question .
now , when i talk about this , people often tell me , &quot; well , isn &apos;t blank the answer ? &quot; -- organic food , local food , gmos , new trade subsidies , new farm bills -- and yeah , we have a lot of good ideas here , but not any one of these is a silver bullet .
today , many large rivers have reduced flows .
yeah , so we face one of the greatest grand challenges in all of human history today : the need to feed nine billion people and do so sustainably and equitably and justly , at the same time protecting our planet for this and future generations .
i think what we have is a pickle problem .
now , most of the phones there are not second-hand at all .
and third is , and i &apos;m taking this from the great american beat poet allen ginsberg , that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency , alternate currencies are also very important , and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks .
if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility , then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms .
it &apos;s harmful because it produces a toxin , and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract .
but the interesting point is , if you look over the 1990s , within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild .
and in chile , you still had antibiotic sensitivity .
every row across here represents one of those 11 zones .
will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area ?
unfortunately , we don &apos;t do great with upper-limb prosthetics .
if they did , how would we tell them what to do ?
his name is jesse sullivan .
and after a few months , you touch jesse on his chest , and he felt his missing hand .
tk : okay , so i think about nine months later that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery , took six more months to have all the reinnervation .
so we collaborated with our colleagues in university of new brunswick , came up with this algorithm control , which amanda can now demonstrate .
what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think , &quot; what hand grasp pattern do i want ? &quot;
we want to build a better arm .
all of these ended once the trial was completed , leaving celine with no alternatives .
local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials , as well as the incentives for participation .
when i came to the galapagos 40 years ago , there were 3,000 people that lived in the galapagos .
so they have all the criteria that people normally like .
but this is a global phenomenon , we know that .
we usually don &apos;t , and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost .
this is turbo the penguin .
most important thing is : only you can change yourself , and only you can change the world and make it better , for people as well as penguins .
so you &apos;re never going to see them on a billboard .
it &apos;s about following your own dreams -- uninvited , uninvited -- and then working with others to make those dreams come true .
thank you .
one gene is changed out of 20,000 , and look at it .
the daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and igf-1 .
so in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that i have the x drawn here through the receptor .
but it &apos;s deteriorating .
so people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected .
and the 70 year-old ones , actually they &apos;re better at scouting out the good nesting places , and they also have more progeny every year .
but let &apos;s talk about the 90 percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born .
stalin , khrushchev and other soviet leaders forced russians out to the far east to be in gulags , labor camps , nuclear cities , whatever the case was .
again , globalization chinese style .
another pillar of the strategy , like russia , is demographic .
now remember kurdistan is landlocked .
he wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule .
and now you have what most people consider a zone of peace spanning 27 countries and 450 million people .
there is a great race on for energy resources under the arctic seabed .
in 2013 , if you &apos;re concerned about a depression diagnosis , you go to your doctor , and what do you get ?
but can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion-like states ?
so we decided to use our puff-o-mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs .
now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans , but in flies we can actually test this .
either way , mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out . they smell us .
one of the best ways of killing mosquitos is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease .
there we go . okay .
where and how can we draw the line ?
i too was fascinated by this new and disruptive cell technology , and this inspired a shift in my mindset , from transplanting whole organs to transplanting cells .
37 million people worldwide are blind , and 127 million more suffer from impaired vision .
and now we go live to caracas to see one of maestro abreu &apos;s great proteges .
they &apos;ll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll .
the more attractive she finds him , the more sex they have ; the more sex they have , the nicer he is to her ; the nicer he is to her , the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed -- and ultimately , they live happily ever after .
now if you &apos;re not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return , i can &apos;t tell you how to find a chore-loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn &apos;t have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce , but i can only encourage you to try , because the benefits , as i &apos;ve pointed out , are significant .
even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times , we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns , and that &apos;s so difficult , chances are we &apos;ll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them .
galvani &apos;s approach of probing the nervous system with electrodes has remained state-of-the-art until today , despite a number of drawbacks .
it was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student , susana lima .
these decisions are clearly a reflection of the actor &apos;s policy .
through many such experiments , we were able to narrow down the identity of the critic to just 12 cells .
twenty-four years ago , i had -- a sophomore in college , i had a series of fainting spells . no alcohol was involved .
and i want to actually introduce you to dr. batiuk , who &apos;s another friend of mine .
all right . so what you &apos;re sort of seeing here is an example of disruptive technologies , of mobile , social and analytic technologies .
they put me through five weeks of tests -- very expensive , very scary -- before the nurse finally notices the piece of the paper , my meds list that i &apos;ve been carrying to every single appointment , and says , &quot; oh my gosh . &quot;
i was optimizing my life for quality of life , and quality of life for me means time in snow .
growth is not dead .
today , productivity is at an all-time high , and despite the great recession , it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s , the roaring 1990s , and that was faster than the &apos; 70s or &apos; 80s .
computers get better faster than anything else ever .
like the first two industrial revolutions , the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out , but they are staggering .
it got so bad that , when he was asked what strategy he would use against a computer , jan donner , the dutch grandmaster , replied , &quot; i &apos;d bring a hammer . &quot;
and i &apos;m really pleased to report to you today that the first synthetic self-cleaning , dry adhesive has been made .
you see something on it . it &apos;s not just to look like a gecko .
and watch it now slip , and see what it does with its tail .
it does an equilibrium glide . highly controlled .
and here is the first active tail , in the robot , made by boston dynamics .
and by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations , a lot of the low-lying states , like kiribati and nauru , they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows .
the ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet .
we had a waves up to 50 ft .
we saw these alternations between sediments that look like this -- there &apos;s gravel and cobbles in there and a bunch of sand .
this is a bleached coral , coral that died during the 1982- &apos; 83 el nino .
we &apos;re not killing the colony ; we &apos;re taking a small core sample out of the top .
and of course , our thermometers only take us back 50 years or so here .
you know , we &apos;ve warmed the globe about a degree centigrade in the last century , and there &apos;s nothing in the natural part of that record that resembles what we &apos;ve seen in the last century .
and here &apos;s the thing : you have to go back about 15 million years to find a time when co2 levels were about what they are today .
now i really think as the world is getting smaller , it becomes more and more important that we learn each other &apos;s dance moves , that we meet each other , we get to know each other , we are able to figure out a way to cross borders , to understand each other , to understand people &apos;s hopes and dreams , what makes them laugh and cry .
and i think the most important reaction that i saw there was actually people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves , that would never have seen that the human spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances .
and then what hit me was , the night before , there had been some kind of bombing in basra , and al jazeera had shown images of the people .
how do we understand what the other person is thinking ? &quot;
be careful !
death unto apartheid ! &quot;
you know , we &apos;ve been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the great pyramid and the great wall of china .
he proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of .
now , this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations .
number one : if there are more dimensions in space , where are they ?
in our era , a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself , many others around the world , it &apos;s called superstring theory , as you were indicating .
when you study the mathematics of string theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space .
they have a very rich , intertwined geometry .
and if this experiment bears fruit , if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there &apos;s less energy in our dimensions than when we began , this will show that the extra dimensions are real .
can anyone see it ? anyone ? no ?
but you put one there . why ?
now , what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to review those two scenes .
move your eyes around , blink , maybe close one eye .
but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner ?
and then we translated these images .
the question is , &quot; is that an illusion ? &quot;
as i said , even this building we &apos;re standing in -- that &apos;s one of the ironies -- this building was part of that series of complexes , what they called the twin towers .
that &apos;s the word lawyers use . it was repealed .
and i can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn &apos;t happened anywhere else on the planet .
it &apos;s like that joke : i want whatever he &apos;s drinking .
i could see what you &apos;re applying for .
now there &apos;s often no right or wrong here .
this is for children .
and what these cognitive biases do is they act as filters between us and reality .
also , feelings that are clouding the issues -- the cognitive biases i talked about earlier , fears , folk beliefs , basically an inadequate model of reality .
i was born in new york city .
now it had a name , which made it scarier than the regular flu , even though it was more deadly .
all examples of models changing .
we rely on government agencies to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe .
this terrified people .
the feeling of security and the reality of security don &apos;t always match , says computer-security expert bruce schneier . in his talk , he explains why we spend billions addressing news story risks , like the &quot; security theater &quot; now playing at your local airport , while neglecting more probable risks -- and how we can break this pattern . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
people come from all over the world to learn , and then they go away and plan exactly how they &apos;re going to collect these seeds .
these seeds are used for restoration .
that child already , at four , understood the most important principle for success , which is the ability to delay gratification .
so we know she &apos;ll be successful . but we have to watch her .
they built it 30 ft. in the air , right through the middle of the city .
this is one of my favorite features in section one .
and i can tell you , our agenda is full .
so we &apos;ve spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to others than finding out how we talk to others .
now everybody agrees .
and how can we tell the muslim brotherhood , as we should , that they must respect minority rights , if we don &apos;t accept majority rights ?
we have to connect with these profound changes .
now , i hope , in the coming years , that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance with civil society in different countries to support their problem-solving , among the afghans , inside the palestinian population , between the peoples of palestine and israel .
values and purpose are going to be the two drivers of software that are going to create the companies of tomorrow .
our food chain , our brilliant products -- and i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m giving you a word from the sponsors -- knorr , hellman &apos;s and all those wonderful products .
it &apos;s the kind of thing that i sit up late at night thinking about sometimes -- often at four in the morning .
so , this used to be completely smooth .
so , this device here is an invisibility cloak .
so , i like to support people that are risking their lives .
not the same one , actually . this is a cast , which i had bought , and then , after buying the cast , i found my own , and i don &apos;t have room for two .
and you know , when i was at microsoft , that was so engrossing , and the whole industry was expanding so much , that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life .
you could certainly tell the difference between a chinese restaurant and a french restaurant by what they had in a larder .
now of course , in medical application , that is very useful because it &apos;s the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history -- except probably , your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do .
and i realized , wow , this would really make a big difference , if we could do it , and so i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s look at it . &quot;
the thing about cancer -- when i got into this , i really knew nothing about it , but working with david agus , i started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out .
and then we know that if we sprinkle drano around the kitchen , that helps .
so thank you very much .
so here is the bottom line .
now , my birthday is coming up shortly , and my driver &apos;s license expires .
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
and in this atmosphere , where the only guidance was people &apos;s values and their noble cause , what this group accomplished was historic .
why did he do that ? because most people are not at stage five .
so , what about moving from stage three to stage four ?
you &apos;re in tribes here . hopefully you &apos;re extending the reach of the tribes that you have .
or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach ?
the few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive , dark green-gray , striated aluminum siding .
the foreboding sheen of an extra-large date .
in the medical context that it comes from , it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment .
and in that light , for the religious , compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty , but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering , in the face of a stranger , in the face of the vibrant religious other .
he &apos;s says that what they do with l &apos;arche is not a solution , but a sign .
and einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced , we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more , not less .
but compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious .
and at the risk of sounding grandiose , it is the world &apos;s loss .
and they all took the spotlight , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
one answer lies deep in our cultural history .
my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when i was growing up , partly because it was filled with his very gentle , very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books .
school , same thing .
then , about the initiative that chris mentioned , that we decided to launch at amd that we call 50x15 .
if we can connect people and ideas more intensely -- and although you &apos;ve seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today , the key to me is how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity , in a useful way , accessibility , in an easy manner , and also affordability , that regardless of the economic status that a person could have , that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology .
because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market , whether it &apos;s education or under-developed nations , either way , it &apos;s a segment that demands incredibly high quality , incredibly high reliability , tremendous low cost and access , and a lot of challenges that frankly , without actually doing it , it would be very difficult to understand , and i &apos;ll explain that in just a minute .
one example of this has been the one laptop per child .
and i said , that i got to write it .
religion doesn &apos;t have a monopoly on that , but there are plenty of religious kooks .
i just don &apos;t believe that .
i don &apos;t personally have enough faith to be an atheist .
now , that &apos;s a principle in the bible that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity , give it away to help other people .
i just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour on three different continents , and i won &apos;t go into that , but it was an amazing thing .
and i could go five years and never , ever see a homeless person .
well , it was a shepherd &apos;s staff . now , follow me on this .
that , to me , is what being purpose-driven is all about .
and i don &apos;t mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don &apos;t go .
and then we can actually roll out large numbers .
so effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
it does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
when the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
and yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
and something else happened instead .
you put together machines and water , and you get landscapes that look like this . and then you get sales that look like this . it &apos;s brute force . so what you &apos;ve been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that &apos;s a reasonably natural system . you start taming that natural system . you put a lot of force behind that natural system . you put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides -- -- behind that natural system , and you end up with systems that look like this .
this is a well-known phenomenon . you eat certain things , you produce a lot of gas . it may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process . if that is true , then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip whole mountaintops off , and it may not be to burn coal . it may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture .
she came to this country in 1986 from vietnam .
but given my befuddled state of mind , i ended up in the self-help section very quickly .
they didn &apos;t even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid .
over dinner , i asked him an impertinent question .
bhutan &apos;s created the ultimate export , a new global currency of well-being , and there are 40 countries around the world today that are studying their own gnh .
we &apos;re not asking anything that &apos;s intangible .
we count on people .
but we &apos;re talking about perception here , right ?
that &apos;s actually what an experiment is .
what was really exciting about this project was we , and beau , had no idea whether it would work .
so here &apos;s the title page . we have a number of authors there .
who else can have these qualities more than children ?
changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . it all depends on the way the person feels about change .
often , we think we &apos;re doing a good thing .
we worked very hard to get the smog reduction happening here in los angeles .
it turns out that our other species has figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things that we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well .
how can this movement be so passionate about saying we don &apos;t have throwaway stuff , no throwaway dead materials , and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communities like &quot; cancer alley ? &quot;
so that &apos;s an asset because if you &apos;ve got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile , forget it -- you &apos;re never going to fly it .
and of course , i suppose like recreational parks you can still do that .
redundancy is the critical issue here .
we &apos;ll never know if this stuff worked . actually , i think the federal bureau of investigation took it down for security purposes , sometime in the early 1900s .
but were able to light that , and do it very successfully .
mobile electronics .
and as i said , in sort of about 10 seconds we should start to see ...
and nokia as well .
second , we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution .
but as i watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body , i imagine the infinity mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment .
it was a city so long ago that it was still called peking .
and yet , he did not die .
so what do i say ?
i knew terence &apos;s wishes as clearly and as surely as i knew my own .
it &apos;s not a bug .
and suddenly he knows he &apos;s been defeated .
in order to do that , we have to put you as a user back in the driver &apos;s seat .
we flew the area . we imaged it . we sent in people . we took pictures of interiors , disaster areas . we helped with the first responders , the search and rescue .
the freshness , the capacity . i can turn this image .
at nasa , you have to have good acronyms .
the algae are not going to suffocate because of co2 , as we would .
san francisco produces 65 million gallons a day of waste water . if we imagine a five-day retention time for this system , we &apos;d need 325 million gallons to accomodate , and that would be about 1,280 acres of these omega modules floating in san francisco bay .
jonathan trent : energy from floating algae pods
you need also state ownership , especially of land assets , in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly .
and country 2 is china .
by that comparison , democracy looks very , very good in terms of economic growth .
this is the world development index indicator data in the early 1990s .
in china , it &apos;s all women .
in fact , when india was growing at a hindu rate of growth -- about one percent , two percent a year -- that was when india was least democratic .
thank you very much .
are there recurring patterns that we can learn from , that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives , or our own organizations , or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative ?
and that means that we have to change some of our models of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like , right .
the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says , &quot; ah , at last , i had a theory with which to work . &quot;
we could probably hear it , if we tune in . &quot;
because see , i have these new nuclear submarines that i &apos;m building .
the 0.1 percent in the u.s .
a critique of crony capitalism is as central to the tea party as it is to occupy wall street .
this is the transformation which has lifted hundreds of millions of the world &apos;s poorest people out of poverty and into the middle class , and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world , it &apos;s made many new products affordable -- who do you think built your iphone ? — and things that we &apos;ve relied on for a long time much cheaper .
the same is true of globalization .
technology is advancing in leaps and bounds -- and so is economic inequality , says writer chrystia freeland . in an impassioned talk , she charts the rise of a new class of plutocrats , and suggests that globalization and new technology are actually fueling , rather than closing , the global income gap . freeland lays out three problems with plutocracy … and one glimmer of hope .
one in a hundred .
but we realized , of course , that we are dealing with cultural issues , and this is , i love this klimt painting , because the more you look at it , the more you kind of get the whole issue that &apos;s going on here , which is clearly the separation of death from the living , and the fear — like , if you actually look , there &apos;s one woman there who has her eyes open .
so that one didn &apos;t really run , but i was very struck by this .
they got on a boat , and yet another divergence -- the boat was either going to canada or to australia .
so , i looked further into it , found as many articles as i could , and it was amazing -- because it turned out that it was very rare .
i mean , there are so many possibilities for why tumors don &apos;t go to skeletal muscle .
and to my astonishment , she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter .
it was very obvious , from the very beginning , that she was a leader .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;ll pay for the ... &quot; i mean , i had this whole sort of picture .
and as we started talking , i saw him yell something , and hyun-sook came and brought us some food .
but he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother .
so , my friend gene flew over with his son , tim .
and you know what kids are like when they &apos;ve been asleep for like an hour , it &apos;s like they took five valiums -- you know , they &apos;re all over the place .
i mean , gene -- thank god for gene .
it was like the ultimate perk .
they were studying korean ; they bought korean clothes .
rick smolan : the story of a girl
it &apos;s a new telescope .
finally , 15 years ago , the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star , and we actually did pretty well .
we know and expect that we &apos;ll see that .
so why should you care about that ?
so in space , the earth is very small .
dimitar sasselov : how we found hundreds of potential earth-like planets
it means 30 to 40 million people , the whole of california -- every person , that &apos;s more or less what we have today in the world .
and this is peaceful zambia , neighboring country -- 15 percent .
brazil has many hiv-infected .
you can get this chart , free .
the average american is nearly 20 times richer than the average chinese by the 1970s .
within an incredibly short period of time , people living in the german democratic republic produced trabants , the trabbi , one of the world &apos;s worst ever cars , while people in the west produced the mercedes benz .
and six , the work ethic .
and this was another killer app -- the very opposite of a killer , because it doubled , and then more than doubled , human life expectancy .
you &apos;re wrong .
and i think these words really nail it : &quot; it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .
and that &apos;s all we seem to be caring about recently .
all spiders make silk at some point in their life .
there &apos;s the aggregate and flagelliform silk glands which combine to make the sticky capture spiral of an orb web .
this makes testing spider silk really , really easy to do in the laboratory , because we &apos;re actually , you know , testing it in air that &apos;s exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins .
yet , their draglines are not the toughest .
how do groups get anything done ? right ?
right ? if i had given this talk last year , i couldn &apos;t do what i just did , because i couldn &apos;t have found those photos .
and fourth , as a result of that exclusion , you end up with a professional class . look at the change here .
you can see here , over at the end , our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos , and you can see there &apos;s a few people who have taken hundreds of photos .
don &apos;t take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people .
and you can see why , from ballmer &apos;s point of view , that &apos;s a bad idea , right ?
the shield laws are our laws -- pretty much a patchwork of state laws -- that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source .
but when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice , then we &apos;re horrified .
you &apos;ve got bran , which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us , or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber , for the bran is fiber .
the yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars , creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it &apos;s burping and sweating , which is what bread is .
there &apos;s a little carry-over baking .
i &apos;d call that radical .
third transformation . first transformation , alive to dead .
no , it &apos;s not — oh , why thank you .
this is an excerpt from a score called &quot; the metaphysics of notation . &quot;
you can see the mayhem continues , and there &apos;s , you know , there were no clarinets and trumpets and flutes and violins . here &apos;s a piece that has an even more unusual , more peculiar instrumentation .
what is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
so there are two really remarkable things about this .
well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
they go out and test it against the evidence .
when children do experiments we call it &quot; getting into everything &quot; or else &quot; playing . &quot;
ag : okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
it &apos;s like being in love in paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
you hook these up -- in this case , to the virtual muscles of that two-legged creature here -- and hope that it does something interesting .
i &apos;m not quite sure why , but we &apos;ve done it anyway .
thank you .
but i must say , i &apos;ll never forget , when i was 13 years old , this happened .
you know , i can &apos;t promise my child a life without bias -- we &apos;re all biased -- but i promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives .
and man , let me tell you , whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -- oh , how did that get up there ? just kidding .
and the technician said , &quot; what ? why are you typing 11 ? &quot; he said , &quot; the message says , &apos; error type 11 . &apos; &quot; so we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users .
you &apos;ve obviously never opened all the toolbars , but all you have to type in is this little , teeny window down here .
here &apos;s another pet one of mine : you have a printer .
even windows is a hack . we &apos;re kind of based loosely on the mac .
i know the ropes now , know what the tricks are .
&quot; speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly . period .
what technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty ?
and i would say that we can &apos;t give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that &apos;s to give up the thing that makes civilization .
if you put electricity on them , they emit light .
we need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently .
we may not be able to stop it , but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem .
and a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids .
but things have changed greatly over the last dozen years .
i always turn my head on the side , and that simple change makes me go from seeing this planet as home , to seeing it as a planet .
this stuff is produced biologically .
and one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it is to have an intermediary .
imagine deciding right now that you &apos;re going to do it .
after hitting on a brilliant new life plan , our first instinct is to tell someone , but derek sivers says it &apos;s better to keep goals secret . he presents research stretching as far back as the 1920s to show why people who talk about their ambitions may be less likely to achieve them .
now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition .
and the candle wax was dirty , and we couldn &apos;t image through the wax .
and when it takes its place , it sheds electromagnetic radiation .
and combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics .
he did this because he understands data as well as books .
why don &apos;t we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance of the internet .
and it arrived , and it was tiny .
this is soap that &apos;s made from silver nanoparticles , which have antibacterial properties .
it &apos;s a cat that lives in trees , and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations .
this is the fastest street-legal car in the world and the most expensive production car .
and at lunch on saturday , we opened the &apos; 47 .
and this is a titan class ship in the space game , eve online .
now , if you take a game like warcraft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great box-opening effort .
it &apos;s not giving me my last two pies . i &apos;m going to give up .
now this is the neurological goldmine , if you like , because a known reward excites people , but what really gets them going is the uncertain reward , the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty , that they didn &apos;t quite know whether they were going to get it or not .
and i just look at this , and i think , yes , we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets , by using elements of uncertainty , by using these multiple targets , by using a grand , underlying reward and incentive system , by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups , in terms of streets to collaborate and compete , to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see .
so that was kind of my first dream , was to start this company called feed , and here &apos;s a screenshot of our website .
and you know , the reality is that between farmers in america , who actually , quite frankly , when i spend time in the midwest , are pretty large in general .
the icons like michael pollan and jamie oliver in his ted prize wish both addressed this last three-decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change .
now , who do we have to blame ?
now , i believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this .
so , the first position we took was , &quot; hey , we as architects had better not show up and do a pristine building that doesn &apos;t engender the same freedoms that this old dilapidated shed provided the company . &quot;
in fact it really was the clients who had to do it .
there you see it &apos;s the side balconies for the proscenium .
as i said , all the balconies can move , but they can also be disappeared completely .
et voila .
this is a photograph i found lying in a gutter in new york city about 10 years ago .
&quot; i feel rough now , and i probably gained 100,000 pounds , but it was worth it . &quot;
so these are some newer projects that actually aren &apos;t even launched publicly yet .
i mean , in real life , things are much more nuanced and complex , and there &apos;s all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other .
and we could do something as arbitrary as , say , extract the story of rony , involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools , taking place on the arctic ocean , at ahkivgaq camp , with the heartbeat level of fast .
a 28-year-old cell phone shop owner .
so his wish was to come with me , so that he had somewhere to live .
jh : 10 years ? yes , yes . jh : 10 years , that &apos;s a long time .
you plan on coming back , getting undressed , going to bed , waking up , doing it again , and that anticipation , that rhythm , helps give us a structure to how we organize ourselves and our lives , and gives it a measure of predictability .
and it &apos;s my zipper , and i &apos;ve still got the staples in and everything .
that &apos;s beautiful , but let &apos;s face it , nobody talks that way .
no one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts , but then again , do you think about those things when you talk ?
it &apos;s a marker of empathy . it &apos;s a marker of accommodation .
so we have a whole battery of new constructions that are developing , and yet it &apos;s easy to think , well , something is still wrong .
so in closing , if i could go into the future , if i could go into 2033 , the first thing i would ask is whether david simon had done a sequel to &quot; the wire . &quot; i would want to know .
he &apos;s making a , kind of , cheek-flapping sound .
it is extremely unlikely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely unlikely they &apos;d be able to seize kabul .
commandant haji malem mohsin khan of kamenj was a great host .
and you &apos;ll be delighted to hear in 2011 , today , that guido westerwelle , the german foreign minister , assures us that we are in the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
it isn &apos;t .
because the worst thing we have done in afghanistan is this idea that failure is not an option .
the problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything ?
and the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want .
the wax printer does what looks like printing .
that &apos;s about all you &apos;re going to get , because you can &apos;t use the usual sort of systems .
and what you see , at the lower right-hand side there , is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top , and it has gone through and distributed itself into these 16 holes on the bottom , in a piece of paper -- basically it looks like a chip , two pieces of paper thick .
interesting problem .
yes bill clinton was from arkansas , but these are very , very profound differences .
you see , comparing the map to &apos; 96 , you see an overlap here .
and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes , not a lot of difference .
and as a result it &apos;s a very tolerant community , which is different , i think , than something like this , which is in schaumburg , illinois , where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac and drive-through starbucks and stuff like that .
we &apos;re losing a ritual .
and the story is that leopold auenbrugger was the son of an innkeeper .
the ipatient is getting wonderful care all across america .
and i learned very early on with my first patient that i could not do justice to this very complicated patient with all the records they were bringing in a new patient visit of 45 minutes .
i &apos;m not sure why you &apos;re laughing .
and the message , which i didn &apos;t fully understand then , even as i delivered it , and which i understand better now is this : i will always , always , always be there .
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
or that the &quot; world weekly news &quot; makes stuff up ?
so he wrote that he had seen -- &quot; i have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies . &quot;
little froggy legs .
in this case , supposedly , these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena .
and said , &quot; i &apos;m so embarrassed .
sadly , 20 million babies like this are born every year around the world .
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
but we don &apos;t think about it that way .
and now we &apos;re in this new model of leadership , where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system , but by leading .
it &apos;s about leading and connecting people and ideas .
he did it by creating a movement .
hugo chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of venezuela . he merely led them .
by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other .
they challenge what &apos;s currently there .
when the disease hit so close to home , i knew i needed to learn more , so i went online to find answers .
and despite their extremely small sizes , they have these incredible properties .
however , subjecting myself to that interrogation , i answered all of their questions , and i guessed on quite a few but i got them right , and i finally landed the lab space i needed .
they have different interests . they have divergent values .
now , &quot; the 99 &quot; is not just a comic book .
and at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship , i think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs .
desire needs space .
what parts of you do you connect to ?
and then i began to ask the reverse question .
the third child doesn &apos;t really come back .
this is not talking heads , in the picture anyway .
the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc . , etc .
around the same , according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker , this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet -- no more eating , drinking and yelling at the stage , or gossiping with one another during the show .
other singers after him went even further .
but now that &apos;s evolved into something else .
the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion , and then somehow it gets shaped into something .
his name was john belk . some of you will probably know him .
where does it come from ?
he said , &quot; it &apos;s easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man . &quot;
that &apos;s what she &apos;s really interested in . &quot;
we see people on our screens .
and he said , &quot; speaking for myself , i can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator . &quot;
for pascal , scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of god .
richard wurman : you did it .
i will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat .
bitches get beat daily .
one woman gives birth to borders .
poet suheir hammad performs two spine-tingling spoken-word pieces : &quot; what i will &quot; and &quot; break &quot; -- meditations on war and peace , on women and power . wait for the astonishing line : &quot; do not fear what has blown up . if you must , fear the unexploded . &quot;
she thought , when everybody knows , they &apos;ll want to do something , but actually nobody wanted to know .
eighty-five percent of people know there &apos;s a problem , but they won &apos;t say anything .
she came up to me one night , and she just said , &apos; dad , you can &apos;t let the kids die . &apos; &quot; or i think of cynthia thomas , a really loyal army daughter and army wife , who , as she saw her friends and relations coming back from the iraq war , was so shocked by their mental condition and the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge post-traumatic stress syndrome that she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town to give them legal , psychological and medical assistance .
her mother was often told by other women , &quot; you and your child will die poor . &quot;
she came to me bloated , very pale .
several years ago , a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women .
i will fulfill the wish .
i &apos;m looking for ways for other girls to be with me .
nobel peace prize winner leymah gbowee has two powerful stories to tell -- of her own life &apos;s transformation , and of the untapped potential of girls around the world . can we transform the world by unlocking the greatness of girls ?
silently , without much fanfare , this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess .
that &apos;s why two amateurs with a few laptops handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster .
to some , this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications . to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections , but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance .
january and february are the dry months in haiti , yet many of the camps had developed standing water .
now i &apos;m not talking here just about the bad companies -- the &quot; abattoirs of the human soul , &quot; as i call them .
you can &apos;t do it all in one day .
so i left work an hour early that afternoon and picked harry up at the school gates .
we leveraged that $ 10,000 seed grant more than 300 times into a $ 3 million park .
so how did things get so different for us ?
physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety , the placement of the waste and other facilities , which , if done properly , don &apos;t compromise a community &apos;s quality of life .
neither the destruction of the ninth ward nor the south bronx was inevitable .
i do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit .
help me fight for environmental and economic justice .
this is 1950 -- those were the industrialized countries , those were developing countries .
you see the importance of that ?
and we go back to 1920 , and i want to look at japan .
they &apos;re so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests .
if we look at the bed here , we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor .
and information will tell her when to go to market with which product .
on the global level , we have to have more than our own thing .
we can have a good world .
she wrote back to me and she said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make mother &apos;s day cards for their mothers . &quot;
about whether all the children there should learn to code .
when you learn to read and write , it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things .
it &apos;s nothing that , really , they can make use of .
now this project is not going to win any prizes for design , and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist .
that for whatever reason , these three proteins have entered a space in the language of our field that &apos;s called the undruggable genome -- which is like calling a computer unsurfable or the moon unwalkable .
and so we worked with samples of material that were collected by young pathologists at brigham women &apos;s hospital .
we gave them our email address , suggesting that , if they write us , we &apos;ll send them a free molecule .
it &apos;s the information that we most need from pharmaceutical companies , the information on how these early prototype drugs might work .
if you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity , it would be moving away from you .
and it &apos;s basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don &apos;t notice , so that macroscopically it looks the same .
so that &apos;s our job .
the curvature of space-time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation , and the black hole radiates .
so if you imagine a very , very big universe , an infinitely big universe , with randomly bumping into each other particles , there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states , and then they relax back .
it &apos;s cooling off .
an egg , an unbroken egg , is a low entropy configuration , and yet , when we open our refrigerator , we do not go , &quot; hah , how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator . &quot;
we have seven children in my family .
another machine pumps water for irrigation .
rather than using it for my computer , i actually opened it .
so i thought , around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- i started thinking , &quot; why can i not take this approach in the reverse way ? &quot;
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements , but , interestingly , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand .
yeah . and i say , &quot; ok , this looks nice , let me print it out , that thing . &quot;
and now , if you see , it &apos;s more about the cost-effectiveness : this system costs you $ 300 compared to the $ 20,000 surface tables , or anything like that .
we had to beat the most powerful man in the world defending his own city .
every time you think of a city , you &apos;ve got to think green .
in this present time today , we only carry 18 percent of our population in high-capacity transportation .
the second point i want to make about the favelas is , you &apos;ve got to open spaces in the favela .
this is osorio , he &apos;s our secretary of urban affairs .
and you can see them working in all parts of the city .
and we get it not from a philosopher of art , not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic .
the peacock &apos;s magnificent tail is the most famous example of this .
and once again , i &apos;d like to look back to prehistory to say something about it .
stretching over a million years , the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto-human history .
and if they try to fight us in the traditional , straight-up manner we &apos;re going to kick their ass , which is why people don &apos;t try to do that any more .
there is no battle space the u.s. military cannot access .
i was in china in august , i said , &quot; you should have 50,000 peace keepers in iraq .
it &apos;s the imf sovereign bankruptcy plan , ok ?
they love to put them on trial . they &apos;ve got milosevic right now .
model on the imf .
so they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization .
it &apos;s not our system of governance .
the department of homeland security is a strategic feel good measure .
you need the experience .
different definitions of network centricity .
i want them to be marines .
i want the rules to be as loose as possible .
now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself .
so we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle .
so basically that &apos;s how it works .
just imagine , in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what &apos;s written and read using these non-visual interfaces .
such fear and mistrust was infectious .
the fellow survivors , the fellow voice-hearers , the comrades and collaborators ; the mother who never gave up on me , who knew that one day i would come back to her and was willing to wait for me for as long as it took ; the doctor who only worked with me for a brief time but who reinforced his belief that recovery was not only possible but inevitable , and during a devastating period of relapse told my terrified family , &quot; don &apos;t give up hope .
this type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
what i &apos;m saying is that we should follow the model that has been so successful with the electronic industry , that what really turned computers into a great success , in the world as a whole , is toys . as soon as computers became toys , when kids could come home and play with them , then the industry really took off . and that has to happen with biotech .
so , what i &apos;m proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life , rather than on mars , although mars is , of course , also a very promising and interesting place .
there is something called pit lamping .
i call these creatures sunflowers .
it was really a death trap . i mean , it was incredible , it worked incredibly well , but it was really dangerous .
it allows the person to switch , and to mix these two colorations .
so , we worked on this bottle , and it &apos;s completely symmetrical in every dimension .
it &apos;s because we were able to run , during the manufacturing process , 20 colors for the x and the o , which is the name of the computer , and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor , you get 20 times 20 : you get 400 different options there .
designer yves behar digs up his creative roots to discuss some of the iconic objects he &apos;s created . then he turns to the witty , surprising , elegant objects he &apos;s working on now -- including the &quot; $ 100 laptop . &quot;
composer and conductor eric whitacre has inspired millions by bringing together &quot; virtual choirs , &quot; singers from many countries spliced together on video . now , for the first time ever , he creates the experience in real time , as 32 singers from around the world skype in to join an onstage choir for an epic performance of whitacre &apos;s &quot; cloudburst , &quot; based on a poem by octavio paz .
a flock of relatives descended on her .
she told me women were running underground schools in her communities inside afghanistan , and that her organization , the afghan institute of learning , had started a school in pakistan .
being different is something the women of lesbor in zagreb , croatia know all too well .
the next morning at church , she asked others how they felt .
and the women of liberia then mobilized in support of ellen johnson sirleaf , a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in africa in years .
it is in these threads that are being woven into a resilient fabric that will sustain communities , that i find hope .
hannah brencher &apos;s mother always wrote her letters . so when she felt herself bottom into depression after college , she did what felt natural -- she wrote love letters and left them for strangers to find . the act has become a global initiative , the world needs more love letters , which rushes handwritten letters to those in need of a boost .
a few weeks ago , i had a chance to go to saudi arabia .
what we call today islamic law , and especially islamic culture -- and there are many islamic cultures actually ; the one in saudi arabia is much different from where i come from in istanbul or turkey .
and the religious police imposes the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen , by force -- like women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hijab , the islamic head cover .
but not just that ; also democracy , parliament , the idea of representation , the idea of equal citizenship .
so in the 20th century , you had this vicious cycle in the arab world where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people including the islamic-pious , and they &apos;re reacting in reactionary ways .
mustafa akyol : faith versus tradition in islam
and very quickly cajal realized that neurons don &apos;t operate alone , but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer .
there have been remarkable advances in understanding the brain , but how do you actually study the neurons inside it ? using gorgeous imagery , neuroscientist and fellow carl schoonover shows the tools that let us see inside our brains .
the lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in 2003 , with just 20,000 killed .
its initial version was skillfully mediated by senator george mitchell .
second , an international diplomatic effort that was hampered from the beginning by western support for kosovo &apos;s independence .
it often takes a generation to accomplish , but it also requires us , today &apos;s generation , to take responsibility and to learn the right lessons about leadership , diplomacy and institutional design , so that the child soldiers of today can become the children of tomorrow .
and when it vanishes , earth becomes mars .
the fundamental forms of ferns followed , to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds .
an asteroid hits , and the world went down in flames .
and you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next .
and that eloquently describes the challenge , changing your appearance for the 30 days , and also the outcome that we &apos;re trying to achieve : getting men engaged in their health , having them have a better understanding about the health risks that they face .
so i cold-called the ceo of prostate cancer canada , and i said to him , &quot; i have this most amazing concept . &quot;
now what i want to share with you is one of my most touching movember moments , and it happened here in toronto last year , at the end of the campaign .
so now we &apos;re funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together , and that &apos;s a unique thing in the cancer world , and we know , through that collaboration , it will accelerate outcomes .
this is the person who contains within him all the knowledge , all the wisdom of centuries and centuries of life , and not just about his people , but about everything that his people &apos;s survival depended on : the trees , the birds , the water , the soil , the forest .
we know we are running out of what we need .
she loved it , but she was too detached .
he &apos;s been a soldier , a teacher , a politician , a vice-mayor and a business man .
they &apos;ve tried to connect worlds they didn &apos;t know existed before .
&quot; how come ? &quot; said kartikeya .
alexander , a young macedonian , met there what he called a &quot; gymnosophist , &quot; which means &quot; the naked , wise man . &quot;
when you play in a race , win ! -- because when you win , the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods . &quot;
because , you see , nothing lasts forever in india , not even death .
take a look .
and people are okay with it .
but belief is not measurable .
and everybody asks me , &quot; which is the better way , this way or that way ? &quot;
you &apos;re too lazy to do it . it &apos;s too hard .
you say , &quot; i have an interest ! &quot; i say , &quot; that &apos;s wonderful !
&quot; i love you more than — &quot; all right ! she left the room halfway through his enumeration of his love for her .
i know what i &apos;m going to do with my life . &quot;
you &apos;re afraid to look ridiculous .
fortunately , her lump proved to be benign .
but imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast .
rather , big ideas can be orchestrated , if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don &apos;t ordinarily talk about .
and you can see that it looks a lot different .
and at this low dose , we &apos;re continuing this screening study , and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram , but an mbi image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer .
third , if you notice a persistent change in your breast , insist on additional imaging .
and there &apos;s this loud , thrilling music in the background , this wild music .
we want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology .
terrifying , because we have stronger opinions about our hand-held devices than about the moral framework we should use to guide our decisions .
i &apos;m just going back and forth ; i &apos;m not getting anywhere .
if you don &apos;t think that way , well , you have a lot of company in the history of western philosophy , because the tidy idea , you know , people criticized it .
and what if he &apos;s been sending little messages to bin laden &apos;s hideout -- or whoever took over after bin laden -- and he &apos;s actually like a terrorist , a sleeper cell .
hannah arendt said , &quot; the sad truth is that most evil done in this world is not done by people who choose to be evil .
why ? because they think about problems differently than we do as technologists .
thank you .
so i wanted to create a kind of sound filter , able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution .
a loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend .
i just do that to make money .
we could talk about a kind of soul , of a ghost accompanying them .
so while i &apos;m talking to you , the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas . sorry for that .
amazing channel .
naming science as his chief inspiration , mathieu lehanneur shows a selection of his ingenious designs -- an interactive noise-neutralizing ball , an antibiotic course in one layered pill , asthma treatment that reminds kids to take it , a living air filter , a living-room fish farm and more .
i don &apos;t have time to talk about it today .
now , sudhir was lucky .
they get the exclusive property rights to control the drug-selling .
so for comparison &apos;s purposes , let &apos;s think about some other walk of life where you may expect might be extremely risky .
so economists talk about game theory -- that every two-person game has a nash equilibrium .
with a proper body position i &apos;m able to really move forward to gain quite some distance .
yet . but people are trying . are you among those -- you &apos;re not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it ?
wingsuit jumping is the leading edge of extreme sports -- an exhilarating feat of almost unbelievable daring , where skydivers soar through canyons at over 100mph . ueli gegenschatz talks about how he does it , and shows jawdropping film .
&quot; and does it matter whether the kind of actions i take filter into a sense of responsibility ? &quot;
so it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities .
i was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off japan .
ew : it was like it was teasing us , doing a kind of fan dance -- now you see me , now you don &apos;t -- and we had four such teasing appearances , and then on the fifth , it came in and totally wowed us .
&quot; the sleepy giant , &quot; which is the song that i just sang , is one of his poems .
he died typhoid fever at the age of 44 , i believe , 43 or 44 .
how do we explore intelligence in this animal that &apos;s so different from us ?
this seems prehistoric now , but this was where we were with technology .
play a real quiet grooming song .
now we started talking with ted about how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants to ted , and we realized that wouldn &apos;t work .
and the third user group , in thailand , is think elephants . go ahead , josh .
the internet of things tell us that a lot of computer-enabled appliances and devices are going to become part of this system too : appliances that you use around the house , that you use in your office , that you carry around with yourself or in the car .
ng : and just mechanically , there &apos;s a 501 and web infrastructure and all of that , but it &apos;s not quite ready to turn on , so we &apos;ll roll that out , and contact us if you want the information on it .
it &apos;s like , if we don &apos;t act now , it &apos;s too late forever , for 10 years now .
it became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense .
they said , &quot; syria ? &quot; &quot; syria . &quot;
what ?
and really , we can be our own ambassadors .
in fact , i actually think that darwin is one of the people who best explains our design process .
we scaled the building up three times to chinese proportions , and went to china .
copenhagen , shanghai , modern , european .
so when we actually won the competition we had to do an exhibition in china explaining the project .
and essentially , the apartments cover the parking .
and our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topography of azerbaijan and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures , inhabitable of human life .
two billion people without sanitation .
imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
as you might see the bottom of the list was climate change .
it might even cost up towards a percentage point of gdp every year for affected nations .
it &apos;s a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect emmerich to cast brad pitt in his next movie digging latrines in tanzania or something .
if we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
i &apos;ve met with presidents , dissidents , policymakers , lawyers , teachers , doctors and the man on the street , and through these conversations , it &apos;s become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there &apos;s actually a split occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the west and that which people believe in the rest of the world .
perhaps it &apos;s no surprise that in a 2007 pew survey , when surveyed , africans in 10 countries said they thought that the chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins , by as much as 98 percent .
now i &apos;m sure some of you in the room will be thinking , well , this is like ceding to china , and this is a way , in other words , for the west to take a back seat .
the developed world holds up the ideals of capitalism , democracy and political rights for all . those in emerging markets often don &apos;t have that luxury . in this powerful talk , economist dambisa moyo makes the case that the west can &apos;t afford to rest on its laurels and imagine others will blindly follow . instead , a different model , embodied by china , is increasingly appealing . a call for open-minded political and economic cooperation in the name of transforming the world .
we become what we really are interested in .
and lately , to be involved in projects where i know about 50 percent of the project technique-wise and the other 50 percent would be new .
so the bath on the left is after five days , and on the right , after 10 .
bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing , and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels , possibly even replacement bone tissue .
in fact , china makes goods for markets all over the world , including its own , thanks to a combination of factors : its low costs , its large and educated workforce , and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands .
what a factory makes is never the point , and the workers could not care less who buys their products .
once , when min &apos;s older sister &apos;s friend got married , she brought a handbag along as a wedding present .
so , if you really want to help these workers , start these small , very focused , very pragmatic classes in these schools , and what &apos;s going to happen is , all your workers are going to move on , but hopefully they &apos;ll move on into higher jobs within apple , and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement .
hazrat ali : they first call us to the mosque and preach to us .
now these children are primed to become suicide bombers .
and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers , and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface , but we weren &apos;t really sure .
it &apos;s always reminded me of the apollo image of the earth , the blue marble picture , and it &apos;s similarly meant to suggest , i think , that we can &apos;t really understand it as a whole .
and that connection is an unequivocally physical process .
he thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness .
we can actually build for you , very rapidly , a physical object .
they were all 3d printed .
now this is an engine component .
i believe we &apos;re at a tipping point where this is now something that we can &apos;t avoid .
and you can start iterating the design .
using this process , pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today .
and the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad were so horrendous , so monstrous , and had such great impact , that his definition was the one that stuck , not just here in the west .
the wealthy fanatics who were previously sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous .
so i think we &apos;ve come to a point now where we can say that , just like all politics , all jihad is local .
who killed bin ladenism ? al jazeera did , al jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in arabic , because they circumvented the old , state-owned television stations in a lot of these countries which were designed to keep information from people .
thank you .
my first dream was to be a doctor , and the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and my family , because my mother was a single mom , and couldn &apos;t afford to pay for school fees .
so she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage -- of the total value , or about 400 dollars in savings .
the first was , instead of the months flying by , forgotten , the time was much more memorable .
i guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not , so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot for the next 30 days .
i began operating my business with 1-2-3 , began writing add-ins for 1-2-3 , wrote a natural language interface to 1-2-3 .
traditionally , concentrators look like this .
he added new linear motion guides to the pistons , he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder , he made the engine double-acting so it had double the power .
so we took the same genetic algorithm that we used earlier to make that concentrator , which didn &apos;t work out for us , to optimize the stirling engine , and make its design sizes and all of its dimensions the exact optimum to get the most power per dollar , irrespective of weight , irrespective of size , to get the most conversion of solar energy , because the sun is free .
thank you .
but if you don &apos;t have grid-supplied electricity , then the whole question of payback is a different one entirely .
they wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .
we have to get special flight clearance .
and that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause .
and what you have to do is , you really have to edit down to what you want to say .
and david remnick , who was really wonderful about it , had one problem . he didn &apos;t like al zheimers , because he thought it would insult people with alzheimer &apos;s .
who knows ? the new york timesselect , the op-ed page , asked me to do a column , and they said , you can do whatever you want .
leaving the shack , the wild blueberry woods , the geese , the river sluch , they went to palestine and then america . &quot;
a complicated question .
it means &quot; i have enough . &quot; and that is utterly true .
td : so those were just a few remarks about my personal background .
td : so , since we &apos;ve been here this week , we &apos;ve taken millions of breaths , collectively , and perhaps we haven &apos;t witnessed any course changes happening in our lives , but we often miss the very subtle changes .
here &apos;s a physical robot that we actually have a population of brains , competing , or evolving on the machine .
it &apos;s an accelerated view , where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process .
two years ago the migrating birds had a multiple event where thousands died because of a mutation occurring in the virus , which made the species range broaden dramatically .
in experimental feeding in monkeys you can see that it actually downregulates a specific immune system modulator .
most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called tamiflu , which may or may not be helpful -- i &apos;ll get into that -- of available vaccines , and any other treatments , and masks , and anything that &apos;s been stockpiled .
and basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs .
when i say enough , that &apos;s two weeks worth .
and i think even those in the leadership would say that is the case , that we still have a long ways to go .
otherwise you &apos;re in trouble .
it takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory , in highly skilled hands .
and so far in the h5n1 cases in people , similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all .
it &apos;s really maneuverable . you have a hand-held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceleration , braking , go in reverse if you like , also have braking .
for christmas i got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation .
oh , when i was buying the clubs , somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others .
so i cut one rope off .
it &apos;s a straight line , which sags , which sways , which vibrates , which rolls on itself , which is ice , which is three tons tight , ready to explode , ready to swallow me .
well now i must say , it was a little bit hard to find a dove in israel , but i got one .
and within seconds the entire valley is applauding in unison with each of my steps .
because of the overhanging leaves and branches , you &apos;ll notice that the understory is very dark , it &apos;s very still .
up in the canopy , if you were sitting next to me and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems , you would also see scenes like this .
and i brought a little segment to give you of duke brady &apos;s &quot; canopy rap . &quot;
and our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in washington state and oregon .
the only difference was , their mistakes were in the secret filing cabinets .
our printing press is the internet . our coffee houses are social networks .
but again , when it comes to the decisions which are impacting us the most , perhaps , the most important decisions that are being made about war and so forth , again we can &apos;t just make a freedom of information request .
i want to see the evidence behind why that &apos;s so .
some fairy tales have happy endings . some don &apos;t .
scuba divers can &apos;t get there , submarines go right on past it .
in 1994 , i was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype closed-circuit rebreathers .
the most critical part of a rebreather is the oxygen sensors .
rp : silvertip sharks -- they &apos;re actually three species of sharks here .
if you go to papua , new guinea , and go down 300 feet , you &apos;re going to see these big mounds .
and there it was , the seat of human consciousness , the powerhouse of the human body , sitting in my hands .
after justin was given anti-seizure medication , the change in him was amazing .
and i wanted this film to be driven by emotions , and really to follow my journey .
so , those are the two clips i &apos;m going to show .
oh ! dad is louis farrakhan ?
he could not say no to anything , and that is why , that he cannot say no to things , we got this building today .
are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics ?
but , this time not one billion dollars , one billion stars .
and we &apos;re a very young technology in an old galaxy , and we don &apos;t yet know whether it &apos;s possible for technologies to persist .
now drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence , but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft , and that &apos;s that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial technology .
i think it &apos;s a problem of completion and delivery , because the fine print said , &quot; what game-changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see ? &quot;
it records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages .
they inspect it , they check it for cracks , for drill damage , for spalls , for chips .
moreover , in this 8,000-mile journey , they have to insure this ice doesn &apos;t melt .
now , similarly , the old story about oil is that if we wanted to save very much of it , it would be expensive , or we would have done it already , because markets are essentially perfect .
that seems to make more sense .
this muscle car from toyota : 408 horsepower in an ultra-light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds , and still gets 32 miles a gallon . i &apos;ll say more later about this .
and this means we &apos;ve just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight .
but they &apos;ll sell it to japan and china instead , because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers , and they don &apos;t .
that in creating the move to high-volume , low-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials , or for that matter , ultra-light steels that are a good backup technology , the military can do the trick it did in turning darpanet into the internet .
i was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books -- after twenty years or so in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn &apos;t think they could sell .
we launched a website on september 2nd that has now served 25 million pages , and has 42,000 registered young girl users .
girl 1 : we have -- in the very beginning of the whole game , always we do this : we each have a piece of paper ; we write down our name , our age -- are we rich , very rich , not rich , poor , medium , wealthy , boyfriends , dogs , pets -- what else -- sisters , brothers , and all those .
rockett : really ? what other party ?
bl : thanks .
i also need alcohol and morphine , because it &apos;s the only way i can work . &quot;
i don &apos;t doubt that that plays some role , but what i want to convince you of today is that there &apos;s something else going on .
they get people into a fmri scanner , and while they &apos;re lying there , through a tube , they get to sip wine .
of course , it was the same man , but she was seeing him in different ways .
that causes a huge drop in the value .
i &apos;ve been focusing now on the visual arts , but i want to give two examples from music .
half of them are told that they &apos;re being given the shocks by somebody in another room , but the person in the other room doesn &apos;t know they &apos;re giving them shocks .
and what i hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims , unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims , isn &apos;t a kind of nasty carping activity ; it &apos;s socially useful , but it &apos;s also an extremely valuable explanatory tool .
it is a description of the changes in one enzyme when you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin onto some cancer cells in a dish on a bench in a laboratory somewhere .
it &apos;s about the cultural meaning of a treatment .
so how does this work ?
but the companies withheld that data from them , and so did the european medicines agency for three years .
i saw people struggling to get by , not knowing what was what and what was next .
and so to help you , perhaps you &apos;re a member of this middle class family in baghdad -- and what you want is the best for your kids .
you think that . it &apos;s not true , of course , but that &apos;s the media impression , and that &apos;s like what you get .
you talk about it .
i mean , here &apos;s a guy who says that your god is a false god .
these christians , who are these christians ?
so here .
and what i want you to do is picture her as a chinese woman receiving a chinese flag because her loved one has died in america in the coal uprising .
can you imagine that maybe one of them in the morning bent down to their child and hugged their child and said , &quot; dear , i &apos;ll be back later .
and that &apos;s , of course , what this is about .
so china , i &apos;ve already mentioned , beginning around 1978 , around the time of the death of mao , growth -- ten percent a year .
this provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important , more powerful than ever before , and are going to increase growth more than ever before .
that &apos;s one reason .
now think what this means .
here is gdp per capita from 1900 to 1929 .
so my view is : be optimistic .
yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures .
some serious biologists , and i count myself among them , have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms , one might -- just might -- find aliens among them .
we urgently need to change this .
now , extinction is a different kind of death .
another keystone species is a famous animal called the european aurochs .
it &apos;s called an allele .
so they hosted and funded this meeting . and 35 scientists , they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists , basically meeting to see if they had work to do together .
he showed how all of this can be put together .
so this photograph was taken last month by ryan with an iphone .
i suspect there are some people out there sitting , kind of asking tormented questions , almost , about , well , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait a minute , there &apos;s something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way .
he ran and worked in a factory .
i went from having art once a week to twice a month to once a month to not at all .
but it was so cool because i could write these stories , i could come up with these ideas , and they &apos;d be published in the school paper , and people who i didn &apos;t know could read them .
so after this experience , my art teacher , mr. shilale , he brought in these picture books , and i thought , &quot; picture books for kids ! &quot;
they were so happy . they couldn &apos;t have been more proud .
and it displayed the work from my first 10 years of publishing , and you know who was there to celebrate ? mrs. alisch .
noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years , and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there .
if you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds by installing acoustic treatments , sound absorbing materials and so forth , this is what you get .
out of that conference , incidentally , also came a free app which is designed to help children study if they &apos;re having to work at home , for example , in a noisy kitchen .
because of poor acoustics , students in classrooms miss 50 percent of what their teachers say and patients in hospitals have trouble sleeping because they continually feel stressed . julian treasure sounds a call to action for designers to pay attention to the &quot; invisible architecture &quot; of sound .
but were you to walk in the opposite direction , this entire sequence happens in reverse .
because , if you look closely enough , things will begin to appear .
something happened along the way .
he was social , and his character , the tramp , spoke to millions .
and it consists of seven chapters -- the chapters are skin , bones , meat , internal organs , blood , fat and miscellaneous .
in the brewing process , there &apos;s lots of cloudy elements in the beer , so to get rid of these cloudy elements , what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of that cloudiness .
in total , i found 185 products .
i think stephen covey had the right idea .
and they said , &quot; yeah ! &quot;
and while you won &apos;t like them all , the key is , they can never , ever know it .
a transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there : &quot; sam devoured the pizza . &quot; you can &apos;t just say , &quot; sam devoured . &quot;
these are reminiscent of the kinds of categories that immanuel kant argued are the basic framework for human thought , and it &apos;s interesting that our unconscious use of language seems to reflect these kantian categories .
so what &apos;s going on ?
so this is a rather fraught situation .
it &apos;s no skin off my back whether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind .
you can take a class in logic , argumentation .
sure , you got some pleasure out of it , maybe your ego stroked , maybe you get some professional status in the field .
daniel h. cohen : for argument &apos;s sake
this is learning something , learning an idea , from an organism and then applying it .
10 to 30 -- craig venter will probably tell you ; i think there &apos;s a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions .
and thirdly , how does life make things disappear into systems ?
and there &apos;s many of them , all over its entire body .
separation technologies are going to be extremely important .
jb : ok , put this -- ok , i &apos;ll just hold this thing . ok , great .
you can &apos;t count what you don &apos;t see .
so these stories together became the herald tribune business cover .
theory and empirical evidence have already taught us .
and she told me , &quot; never import other people &apos;s limitations . &quot;
lothar meggendorfer put his foot down , and he said , &quot; genug ist genug ! &quot;
but can i use a paper towel ?
and so this is framing -- lumber , composite materials -- and it &apos;s kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that , but it can be a sustainable resource if you use fsc-certified lumber .
how many of you have seen the alfred hitchcock film &quot; the birds &quot; ?
but the researchers had a problem .
if i have a little extra time , i &apos;ll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely .
or maybe do search and rescue ?
so i &apos;m going to talk to the baby . so i say to the baby , holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof , i say to the baby , &apos; sir or madam , what is your considered opinion of the human species ? &apos; and the baby looks , you know , the way babies look at you clearly , starts laughing , starts busting out with this crazy little laugh .
everything i do is word for word off a tape .
all around her head was just swollen ; her head was about two sizes of its own size .
and this is called , &quot; swallowing the bitterness . &quot;
igniting , igniting , igniting fire . igniting fire .
i mean , i have my ranch and everything , but i actually don &apos;t even want to think the day that comes .
and in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years , or that we &apos;d help to build a new factory for the company , we &apos;d help to finance it . the uaw , who represented the workers , said they would offer unprecedented concessions , sacrifices to just keep those jobs in greenville .
you might say obamacare , except for those were not voluntary changes .
you might look at michigan and say , we &apos;re going to lead the nation in producing the guts for the electric vehicle , like the lithium ion battery .
if you hadn &apos;t noticed , our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender , and i think that &apos;s going to change .
but they get a lot more information about what you do online , what you like , what interests you .
i &apos;ve spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people &apos;s lives .
you have these up-and-downs .
we have applied this theory early on , that was our first success , to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements on the iron rocket .
there might be a crash . certainly not sustainable .
the idea is the following . we monitor the markets .
thank you .
i &apos;ll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring .
i &apos;ll listen for what &apos;s missing , and i &apos;ll put it there .
so i interviewed her in oakland , in a sushi restaurant .
i said , &quot; you should actually do this . &quot;
they didn &apos;t buy it .
this is my unveiling , because i am going to show you a clip .
this is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque .
the school where he graduated from with his master &apos;s had just offered him a teaching appointment , which meant not only a salary , but benefits for the first time in ages .
however , i also have reason to believe that many , if not most , of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly .
first of all -- any questions so far ?
so that you can just appreciate how serious i am about all this , i brought along the patents , the specifications for some of these works , because i &apos;ve had my working methods patented at the eidgenössische amt für geistiges eigentum in bern , switzerland .
for example , with the keith haring circles and kandinsky &apos;s dots .
i just piled them up .
you gotta make it your own . you gotta design it .
i went , &quot; wait a minute , all right , right -- i &apos;ll get the wheels . &quot; purely out of protest , i got the flashy wheels , and i installed them and -- check this out . could i have my special light cue please ?
it &apos;s anders breivik . now , if he intended to kill in olso , norway last year , dozens and dozens of young people -- if he intended to do that , he &apos;s a vicious criminal . we punish him .
from your sperm tests we can confidently say that you &apos;re basically a form of birth control . &quot;
but consider what plato is doing here . what is he doing ?
we sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes .
to get back to this , to get back to design , and as my daddy suggested a long time ago , &quot; make the song your own , john .
abed could still turn his wheel left so that i would see him whoosh by out my window and i would remain whole .
was i what had been done to me ?
i drove off and returned at 4 : 30 , thankful to the minaret up the road that helped me find my way back .
he &apos;d lived an unholy life before the crash , and so god had ordained the crash , but now , he said , he was religious , and god was pleased .
but it was hard for me to relate to one who had so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing , to one whose life was so unexamined that he said he thought two people had died in the crash .
thanks a lot .
okay , so you smile , frowning .
nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day , which is more than we &apos;re sleeping , at 7.7 hours .
nilofer merchant suggests a small idea that just might have a big impact on your life and health : next time you have a one-on-one meeting , make it into a &quot; walking meeting &quot; -- and let ideas flow while you walk and talk .
and if you did this for all thousand tedtalks , you would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000 .
they just had some general comment .
i wanted to go all the way , all the way down the distillery , starting out with a thousand tedtalks .
now let &apos;s fast-forward to the 1990s when those two teams of astronomers i mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing .
first off , what is it ?
maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other .
so we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life .
because the theory predicts that the big bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded , tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world , yielding a distinctive fingerprint , a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots , across space , which powerful telescopes have now observed .
well it &apos;s hard to say .
he is just going to use his hand , his body and his voice , just like humans interact with their hands , body and voice .
it never works .
okay , this is skimming stones .
he &apos;s just moved house . he &apos;s got no friends .
peter molyneux : meet milo , the virtual boy
i learned about sharing . i learned about camaraderie .
and that was just a small percentage of the dead .
a colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world .
you can put it louder if you can .
she played the game without moving her body .
the animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets .
well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world .
let me take you to the real china .
the village became a real standout .
in india , in the first year of life , from zero to one , boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast , and the breast shows no son preference .
and i &apos;ll just say two things about this .
they ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night .
and when she couldn &apos;t produce enough , she hired other women in the village .
and that goat was $ 120 .
she never broke down .
according to that story , early humans developed the conceit that , by using their language to work together , they could build a tower that would take them all the way to heaven .
sure enough , their tools were more complicated than those of homo erectus , but they too showed very little change over the 300,000 years or so that those species , the neanderthals , lived in eurasia .
and we really had only two options for dealing with the conflicts that visual theft would bring .
now the job is done .
they &apos;re far closer together than that . &quot;
and in 2007 alone -- and i &apos;m sure there are more recent figures -- something on the order of 1.3 million pages were translated into english alone .
mr : thank you very much indeed .
i don &apos;t want to depress you too much .
here &apos;s mount pinatubo in the early &apos; 90s . that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud .
that report , in fact , which had all the modern climate science -- the only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering .
i &apos;ll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
you might imagine that we would fight wars over that box .
you might argue about the sanity of it , but the leverage is real .
should we have a national research program that looks at this ?
photography threatens fantasy .
there is a pig &apos;s head and african cane rats .
and the film was shot on 72 millimeter , government-issue film .
this is live hiv virus at harvard medical school , who is working with the u.s. government to develop sterilizing immunity .
he served 18 years of a death sentence .
and it reiterates that distortion is a constant , and our eyes are easily deceived .
so the exo is designed to be simply , basically like a coffee cup . they can actually stack together so we get extremely efficient transportation and storage out of them .
hopefully very soon we will be there , because we are destined , obsessed with making it real .
all right , so what about the rest of it ?
it &apos;s actually running at real rate right now , one second per second , and in fact , voyager 1 here is flying by titan at i think it &apos;s 38,000 miles per hour .
this is called hooked on a feeling : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
and freud in part reflects the anatomy of the human emotion system -- which is that we have both a positive and a negative system , and our negative system is extremely sensitive .
absent from this list , and absent from any discussions of happiness , are happiness in another &apos;s happiness .
extroverts use it more than introverts .
so a person can be in a long term attachment , become romantically infatuated with someone else , and want to have sex with a third person .
they went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control to generosity and forgiveness .
because , aren &apos;t they vermin ?
in the next step , animals learn to find real mines in real minefields .
so in our common language , dutch , the name for t.b .
the way forward for us is now to standardize this technology .
today i &apos;ll talk about a different approach , which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain , and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain .
so , this made evolution suddenly lamarckian , instead of darwinian .
you &apos;ve dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
also , it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable , that people assume i represent something genuinely indian when i wear it , because that &apos;s not how i feel .
it didn &apos;t look indian anymore .
how do we decide who we are ? hetain patel &apos;s surprising performance plays with identity , language and accent -- and challenges you to think deeper than surface appearances . a delightful meditation on self , with performer yuyu rau , and inspired by bruce lee .
so , trees : very boring flowers , not really trying to attract insects .
it &apos;s being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made , where banknotes have come from , to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did .
so what this really suggested to us at the national level was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies , which had been developed in men , by men , for men for the last 50 years -- and they work pretty well in men , don &apos;t they ? -- weren &apos;t working so well for women .
she had to make other people believe that she looked like a man and she could have the same rights that the men had .
hollywood heart attack . ughhhh .
well once again , women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem .
why are there women and men ?
you now , hopefully , have a more personal relationship with your heart .
well it means growing an actual heart , let &apos;s say , or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body .
but what &apos;s really amazing is that the cells , when we electrically stimulate them , like with a pacemaker , that they beat so much more .
and all of these fed into a disc array that was designed for a continuous capture .
and we would plot the relative length of the utterances .
nanny : all right .
and what we &apos;re seeing here , these skyscrapers now , are commentary that are linked to content on television .
and of course , through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language .
dr : thank you .
and this is deep inside of the brain . it &apos;s very old , evolutionarily .
and it &apos;s very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else .
have a little turret there .
it doesn &apos;t look like a can of beer , but the design take-offs are absolutely unmistakable .
then , somebody gave me a bidet , so it got a bidet .
if i have a hundred of these , a hundred of those , it doesn &apos;t make any difference what these and those are .
and so if something isn &apos;t standard , &quot; oops , dumpster . &quot; &quot; oops &quot; this . &quot; oops , warped . &quot;
it &apos;s a chattel mortgage , just like furniture , just like a car .
my oh my , that makes it worse .
wildebeests don &apos;t hang with lions because lions eat wildebeests .
everybody points and laughs , and they say , &quot; he tried it a fifth time and it still didn &apos;t work .
and when they do , they find that behind the glass , they find me .
that statistic is so sad .
and with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged , i felt everything simultaneously .
untestable -- that &apos;s when i &apos;m in my coma .
this affected my entire body .
so it goes in and it stays there .
and what i would love to add because i didn &apos;t have time ...
but one late night , when i was compiling the report i really realized my discovery . i have shown that swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees .
but now , bangladesh -- it &apos;s a miracle that happens in the &apos; 80s : the imams start to promote family planning .
in sierra leone , humanitarian aid .
the poorest are down there . if i split south africa , it &apos;s like this .
now , statisticians doesn &apos;t like it , because they say that this will not show the reality ; we have to have statistical , analytical methods .
and there i met francis crick .
so i changed the locations , and then we found the base pairing , and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions .
so the first disease he looked at is autism .
and they started settling out .
patents are very difficult to overturn .
&quot; lucky for you he calls at all , &quot; said jasmine .
at this moment , i saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes .
i &apos;ll never forget that one girl looked in her father &apos;s eyes with that camera and said , &quot; daddy , when you look at me , what do you see ? &quot;
and it was because of scenes like this .
and in both cases , we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses , and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries .
the risks are massive , but the pay-off -- economic , humanitarian , motivational -- it &apos;s absolutely huge .
and they also have to dodge bullets , because we have got to operate during shaky cease-fires and truces to try and vaccinate children , even in areas affected by conflict .
the brutal truth is , if we don &apos;t have the will or the skill , or even the money that we need to reach children , the most vulnerable children in the world , with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine , then pretty soon , more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year .
we &apos;re working closely with the international committee of the red cross to ensure that we can reach every child .
it &apos;s ready to reach them with bed nets , with other things .
b it &apos;s interesting .
and early on , a lightning bolt hit a tree 20 paces away from us .
bj : but we truly do spend day and night trying to capture unique footage .
beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is , and i &apos;m on the other side where my space is .
bj : and of course , through the night , they lay together .
if they disappear , whole ecosystems in africa disappear .
the biologist lewis wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example . science , as opposed to technology , does violence to common sense .
he quickened his pace , almost to a jog now .
so &quot; really &quot; isn &apos;t a word that we should use with simple confidence .
miracles are just events that are extremely improbable .
personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans , it &apos;s hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we &apos;re trying to think about entities for which it &apos;s not appropriate , like basil fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole .
i became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled .
with chad &apos;s group at brown , i regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week , from my home 3,000 miles away .
henry evans and chad jenkins : meet the robots for humanity
and hopefully in the future we &apos;ll be able to gain some deeper understanding of how they communicate .
evan grant demonstrates the science and art of cymatics , a process for making soundwaves visible . useful for analyzing complex sounds , it also makes complex and beautiful designs .
ethan zuckerman : obviously , this is a tragic situation , and it actually gets worse .
they looked at their local population .
it &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to fijian music .
if you watched a television broadcast in the united states in the 1970s , 35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news on a nightly new broadcast .
our mission was to fix the world &apos;s media .
they translate roughly 100 articles a day from major newspapers , major websites .
but with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
it &apos;s because , for him , sport is the language that allows him to encounter the full width and wonder of the world .
it &apos;s a problem across the developing world , and in middle income countries too . in jamaica , for example -- look at jamaican members of parliament , you meet them , and they &apos;re often people who are rhodes scholars , who &apos;ve studied at harvard or at princeton , and yet , you go down to downtown kingston , and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites that you can see in any middle-income country in the world : a dismal , depressing landscape of burnt and half-abandoned buildings .
democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty . it reflects an idea of dignity , the dignity of the individual , the idea that each individual should have an equal vote , an equal say , in the formation of their government .
and it &apos;s not completely gratuitous , because wok and roll -- chinese food and japanese foods , so it kind of works out .
another one of my favorite dishes : general tso &apos;s chicken -- which , by the way , in the us naval academy is called admiral tso &apos;s chicken .
but in china , this guy &apos;s actually known for war and not chicken .
lem sen , who &apos;s this guy : i would have made this money , too , but i &apos;ve spent all this time looking for the american man who stole my recipe .
chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing , i would argue , with the menu and the décor -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters .
and the great innovation of chicken mcnuggets was not nuggetfying them , because that &apos;s kind of an easy concept , but the trick behind chicken mcnuggets was , they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-effective manner , which is why it took so long for other people to copy them .
finally , in about the sixteenth century , a physician whose name was theophrastus bombastus aureolus von hohenheim , called paracelsus , a name probably familiar to some people here -- -- good , old paracelsus found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion .
i &apos;m telling you this story , because actually ever since richard called me and asked me to talk about -- as he asked all of his speakers -- to talk about something that would be new to this audience , that we had never talked about , never written about , i &apos;ve been planning this moment .
and they did have tofranil and other things -- mellaril , who knows what .
but i had something better . and it was very simple .
sherwin nuland : how electroshock therapy changed me
the recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do .
and maybe you can use that liquid kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins , for example , or maybe an entire bone .
and so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have , that they &apos;re programmably degradable .
some of you in this middle section -- you have red / green paddles .
the other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911 .
stick with the people you know .
he makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us , these strong ties in our lives , actually have a homogenizing effect on us .
how might we think differently about our relations with technologies , things that effectively become social participants in their own right ?
so , i got working . i took some sheets of paper and started practicing , practicing , practicing , until i reached what i thought was a steady hand , and went into action .
his parents were jewish , russian and above all , very poor .
but demand was ever-growing and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents .
she explained that the father that she &apos;d had would tell them he &apos;d come and pick them up on sunday to go for a walk .
my father watched , benevolently , of course , the demonstrations of the month of may , but his heart was elsewhere , and so was his time because he had over 15 countries to serve .
this is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .
simultaneously , they branch off in the mid-50s , 10 years after the second world war , showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid-50s .
but it shows that we are interconnected , among many systems on the planet , with the three big systems , climate change , stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification being the three big systems , where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds in the paleo-record of the history of the planet .
the australian great barrier reef is another success story .
so , there is scientific evidence .
the first person was wearing a black tie , a tuxedo . it was me .
&quot; the snail . &quot;
and by manipulating sugar over a black paper , i made portraits of them .
and you have to walk very far to be able to see it .
but nothing , of course , in nature is totally perfect , so sometimes an error is made and a wrong letter is built in .
we either live inside africa today , or in quite recent exile .
so an interesting question is , what happened when we met ?
so this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with neanderthals , but far back and then have a long independent history .
we cannot predict the future .
so this airplane has no windows anymore , for example .
how this looks in particular , you can show it here .
so they may be looking at a light in the ceiling , or they may be isolated in the corner , or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements , in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere .
this is our body wisdom . it &apos;s not something that is mediated by our language . our body just knows that , and we &apos;ve known that for a long time .
so i feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative .
well , we took a construct from our pediatrician friends , the concept of growth charts .
and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities .
and that &apos;s to boost everybody &apos;s confidence , to show that you &apos;re not scared .
so then you look around , you &apos;re under a canopy and you say , &quot; this is good . &quot;
and i still believe real leaders are like that .
so we had to get complex intelligence together , we had to line up the ability to act .
and i said , &quot; john , where &apos;s your son ? and how is he ? &quot;
this isn &apos;t easy stuff .
and in the course of the exhibition -- which was contentious , controversial and ultimately , for me , life-changing in my sense of what art could be -- a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other .
the space in which now , in my project of discovery , of thinking about artists , of trying to define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century .
but , really , it has been what i &apos;ve discovered about myself and what i can offer in the space of an exhibition , to talk about beauty , to talk about power , to talk about ourselves , and to talk and speak to each other .
many of the solutions that i and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common : transparency , collaboration , a willingness to experiment , and an appreciation of science -- or , more appropriately , science !
the political aspects of mobile phones can &apos;t be ignored either , from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government , to the blairwatch project in the uk , keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press .
you could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones .
a system like earth witness would be a tool for all of us to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and , ultimately , the improvement of the planet itself .
they downloaded it from disney.com , or one of these websites , 14 days after putting the computer in their village .
sm : and i asked him , &quot; do you send emails ? &quot;
remember , they don &apos;t study english .
the first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes .
two children watch a tedtalk .
sm : so you know what &apos;s happened ?
and they moved their bodies and they came forward , and the lights bounced off these costumes .
it &apos;s a circle of silk on the floor that disappears into the hole in the stage floor .
and all of a sudden , i thought , &quot; well , who am i gonna get to play prospero ?
so i went from theater , doing &quot; the tempest &quot; on the stage in a very low-budget production many years ago , and i love the play , and i also think it &apos;s shakespeare &apos;s last play , and it really lends itself , as you can see , to cinema .
jt : if i give enough movement in the sculpture , and the actor moves their head , you feel like it &apos;s alive .
boy falls from the sky , rise above .
but when we look at the information there , we can see that things are starting to become a little fuzzy about five minutes or so before the cardiac arrest .
it is displaying data that exists already in a different way , to amplify it , to provide cues to the doctors , to the nurses , so they can see what &apos;s happening .
first of all , i thought , well , we need a sales team , and we clearly aren &apos;t the a-team here , so let &apos;s -- i did all this training .
but as human beings , we also want to see each other , and we want to be heard by each other , and we should never forget that .
and i really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so . because the company was literally 10 days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world-quality level needed to make coartem , when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history .
and if avian flu hits , or for any other reason the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority , everybody loses .
it takes opening your arms , both , wide , and expecting very little love in return , but demanding accountability , and bringing the accountability to the table as well .
so we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using , divided between two floors .
small stuff stinks , but , of course , it &apos;s essential , right ?
i mean , &quot; curiosity &quot; -- excuse me .
but also , technology has helped to write new pages of our history , or at least to update pages of our histories .
did i mention they &apos;re gorgeous ?
here &apos;s an example from kevin eggan &apos;s lab at harvard .
i &apos;ve tried to show in this -- though the color doesn &apos;t come out -- that what i &apos;m concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble that you are in . you tend to be interested in a generation past , a generation future -- your parents , your kids , things you can change over the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble you kind of move along in . and in that 50 years , if you look at the population curve , you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we &apos;re up three-and-a-half times since i was born . when you have a new baby , by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when i was born .
we did things on land , in the air , on water -- vehicles of all different kinds , usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them . i find they &apos;re all the same , whether its land , air or water .
we couldn &apos;t bring one here to fly it and show you .
pm : if you can pass it down when you &apos;re done . yeah , i think -- i lost a little orientation ; i looked up into this light .
pm : last night we gave it a few too many turns and it tried to bash the roof out also . it &apos;s about a gram .
it was an exercise in democratic schooling , and i am all for democratic schooling , but we were only seven .
so 2 ^ 5 , those five little twos multiplied together .
lucas again , in 1876 , showed us - 1 , 21 digits long , was not prime .
not years ago , not months ago , days ago .
let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful .
it wasn &apos;t my highlight of 2012 .
and despite their ferocious appearance , tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals .
in fact , the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister , and something that we hadn &apos;t really thought of before .
what this told us was that jonas &apos; tumor did not arise from cells of his own body .
and just as the tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells , so is this dog cancer .
elizabeth murchison : fighting a contagious cancer
and it doesn &apos;t mean that we think things will magically turn out okay , but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so .
the psychologists margaret marshall and john brown studied students with high and low expectations .
we know that , because when you ask people about their ultimate favorite day of the week , surprise , surprise , saturday comes in at first , then friday , then sunday .
so cancer , for example , is about 30 percent .
so we wanted to know , could we change this ?
but the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias does not shatter the illusion .
anybody can play in the game .
for example , the great oxford historian who taught here at this university , a.j.p. taylor , defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war .
let me mention three reasons why it &apos;s too simple .
what caused it ?
and the only way you can solve these problems -- and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century -- is through cooperation , through working together , which means that soft power becomes more important , that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and to be able to get cooperation .
the record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive .
why does the politics get easier ?
post-conflict economic recovery is a slow process .
it would be ideal to have a standard set of norms where , when we got to a post-conflict situation , there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties .
the construction sector has a vital role , obviously , in reconstruction .
the planning function and policy function stays with the ministry ; the delivery of services on the ground , you should use whatever works -- churches , ngos , local communities , whatever works .
so that &apos;s the focus on the construction sector .
like it or not , ready or not , this is our future .
in ethiopia , 70 percent , that &apos;s 7-0 percent of the population , depends on rainfall for its livelihood .
the asian cities climate &#91; change &#93; resilience network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves .
manias can be alarming .
she studies 12 hours a day for three years to prepare .
thank you very much .
and initially , that archaeologist would be baffled .
and luria said , &quot; but what do my words imply ? &quot;
they put it in albany rather than new york .
it &apos;s also been the upgrading of tasks like lawyer and doctor and what have you that have made demands on our cognitive faculties .
and then we can bring empirical evidence to bear , can &apos;t we , and say , well how can you consider all blacks tainted when st. augustine was black and thomas sowell is black .
think how different america would be if every american knew that this is the fifth time western armies have gone to afghanistan to put its house in order , and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions .
and i said , &quot; pam , you &apos;re such a modern , cutting-edge person .
there was no program directive , no manual to follow , no standards in gifted education in that way .
and then i saw my own parents , my first teachers .
they have different assets , commercial and military .
the students run the game .
we were all upset with her , &quot; why are you doing this ?
it &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot;
the world bank president was a third-grader one time .
every game we play is different .
this was kind of the defining slogan .
but give a child a triangle , he can &apos;t do a thing to it .
this is one-way traffic .
and you don &apos;t need the three billion-dollar hadron collider for doing this .
over 100,000 children learn science this way .
if i spin this pulley , the small one &apos;s going to spin much faster .
and all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves .
when we were working on the eden project , we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular , but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried .
so they were paid to collect it from the restaurants .
and the ingenuity , if you could call it that , goes even further .
that &apos;s exactly what the seawater greenhouse produces .
but here it &apos;s about synergies and abundance and optimizing .
i figure about half of that are men , so that takes the number down to 750,000 .
there was this guy steve , the i.t. guy .
the other problem is that these websites are asking us questions like , are you a dog person or a cat person ?
and i thought , i &apos;ve done it !
well , one month later , i had a lot of data , and i was able to do another analysis .
he talked in detail about travel .
i &apos;d like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading shakespeare . right ?
so clearly playing those action games doesn &apos;t lead to attention problems .
when we do that , we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really , really good .
so that &apos;s really the crux of the research , and to do that , we need to go one more step .
daphne bavelier : your brain on video games
let &apos;s just do a little mathematical experiment , try and find out .
but i &apos;m happy to say it &apos;s actually going really well .
but the goal is to go much further and , very broadly , to democratize all of this knowledge , and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas .
it &apos;s a precise specification with a precise formal language that causes mathematica to know what to do here .
in a sense , we can use the computational universe to get mass customized creativity .
it &apos;s taken us a long way already , but there &apos;s so much more to come .
if we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest , we see that sub-saharan africa is the worst hit region by hiv / aids .
thank you very much .
but when my father came , he would sell the cows , he would sell the products we had , and he went and drank with his friends in the bars .
it &apos;s something that so many girls -- i &apos;m lucky , i never died -- but many die .
he gave me a list of another 15 men that i went -- 16 more men -- every single morning i went and visited them .
i want you to meet one of the girls in that school .
be the first . people will follow you .
this was world war ii . do you know why savings was so high ?
does anybody know why ?
a couple things that are kind of cool .
complete transparency .
trust is not parceled out , as we all know .
well , they have a lot , because it &apos;s their network of people . right ?
and i asked myself , why ?
i want you to true your wheels : be honest about the praise that you need to hear .
on the one hand was my mother , a well-educated , secular , modern , westernized , turkish woman .
in my opinion , one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling .
i came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country : politics , cigarettes and the veil .
at this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety , started to include in her daily prayers that i urgently get married so that i could settle down once and for all .
there &apos;s a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the western world are lumped together .
identity politics is made of solid bricks .
we usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
&quot; the grey album &quot; becomes an immediate sensation online , and the beatles &apos; record company sends out countless cease-and-desist letters for &quot; unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property . &quot;
so , bob dylan , like all folk singers , he copied melodies , he transformed them , he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff .
here is the first ever slide-to-unlock .
1983 . bob dylan is 42 years old , and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past .
just look at google maps here . there &apos;s block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
because , if i &apos;m going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration , i should tell you how much it costs .
that &apos;s probably this place , which is a moon of jupiter , europa .
it &apos;s called &quot; helios &quot; -- helios from the sun .
the voyager is a tiny machine .
a recent study showed that the young generation alone is spending over eight hours a day online .
so i sent her online , of course , to look it up .
today we &apos;ve launched collusion .
and people would drive up next to me and say , &quot; john , what are you doing ? &quot;
well , that lasted 17 years .
i had 13 students when i first walked into the class .
my sister said maybe i should leave you alone , because you seem to be doing a lot better when you &apos;re not saying anything . &quot;
because if we are the environment , then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other .
and we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we &apos;ve become , and go to the place of who we are becoming .
and it seems like every department had nothing , so they had to rely on our creativity and turn every problem into an opportunity .
it still sounds too low . &#93; jacques languirand : &#91; that &apos;s normal .
so here i was with one of my childhood heroes , drawing every single frame that &apos;s in the film to turn that into montreal in the future .
i saw my father wither away and die .
i knew the journey would be risky , but i would be risking my life either way .
i decided to go , just because they told me to , without trying much .
they have to force themselves to survive , have hope to survive , but they cannot make it without help .
i just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
it just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
so this building became a permanent building .
but it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
i write books and magazine articles .
now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful ?
will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity ?
but that may not be all that &apos;s going on .
that important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they spend in the womb .
we do it every day , while reading novels , watching television or going to the movies .
we feel compelled to tell them .
tm : thank you , thank you .
so unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity , you &apos;re actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody , okay ?
our own sense of self-aggrandizement feels that big important problems need to have big important , and most of all , expensive solutions attached to them .
they said , &quot; can we do an advertising campaign ?
but it &apos;s very , very uncomfortable for us to actually acknowledge that we &apos;re living in such a world .
it may seem that big problems require big solutions , but ad man rory sutherland says many flashy , expensive fixes are just obscuring better , simpler answers . to illustrate , he uses behavioral economics and hilarious examples .
and i &apos;m going to show you two demos of why this is useful .
thank you .
the cost of a cup of coffee can save a child &apos;s life , right .
the money came in basically overnight .
and it &apos;s investments , not donations , not loans , but investments that have a dynamic return .
if we extrapolate back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago .
if it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available .
but how efficient is , really , this multitasking ?
there we go . all right .
they don &apos;t really know what exponential means , but this is exponential .
but here are a couple things i can say .
now , we &apos;ve got to solve that problem , because that &apos;s a critically important problem , and you might say , &quot; well , okay , how are we gonna solve that problem with seti ? &quot;
they get interested in something .
some of the colors are designed to hypnotize , these lovely patterns . and then this last one , one of my favorites , this pinwheel design .
and you see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn &apos;t use your camouflage , use your skin to change color and texture .
and selam means peace in many ethiopian languages .
let &apos;s go somewhere else . &quot;
to answer this question , we can phrase another question .
can you imagine how much biased his report would be ?
it &apos;s a place marked on ancient maps as &quot; here be monsters . &quot;
and how did we do that ?
so what we need to do is to stand up boldly , singly and together , to push governments , to push regional fisheries management organizations , to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing , so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime .
so we have the tools and treasures coming from the census of marine life .
many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide .
work ! rupert murdoch said to me , &quot; it &apos;s all hard work .
you gotta persist through failure . you gotta persist through crap !
death : adam ?
and this man , archie cochrane , is a prisoner of war and a doctor , and he has a problem .
he very carefully and meticulously notes his results in an exercise book .
but a typical hans rosling graph : think for a moment , not what it shows , but think instead about what it leaves out .
the complexity here is unbelievable .
you pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle .
i could give you all kinds of facts and figures about the u.s. economy , but i think the most salient one is this : ten percent of american businesses disappear every year .
we &apos;re going to test them out . they &apos;ll probably all fail .
and then he says , &quot; well that &apos;s very interesting , gentlemen , because when i gave you the table of results , i swapped the two columns around .
but he made mistakes in a good direction .
when we think about economic growth stopping , we go , &quot; that &apos;s not possible , &quot; because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned .
and these are not esoteric limits .
but we see , mistakenly , each of these issues as individual problems to be solved .
you can &apos;t see the danger at your door .
the only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel .
five years ago , for instance , i found myself waking each morning in misty seattle to what i knew was an impossible question : what actually happened one desert night , half the world and almost half of history away ?
this might be somewhat difficult to grasp now that we use the word &quot; awesome &quot; to describe a new app or a viral video .
and we &apos;ve allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that no matter whether they claim to be christians , jews or muslims , militant extremists are none of the above .
after keeping company with him as a writer for the past five years , i can &apos;t see that he &apos;d be anything but utterly outraged at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak and act in his name in the middle east and elsewhere today .
and your friendly citibank had 47 times .
that was eight bucks last week , four bucks this week , a buck next week .
and its 225 largest companies today are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago .
then they grow exponentially .
i mean , you &apos;re born with no teeth .
we also thought we &apos;d have this robot to warn us of danger .
they &apos;ll do stuff you and i can &apos;t do .
they had their two cures . until a particular mother , whose child had just turned two , died of this disease .
so if you look at that data -- it &apos;s right up on the national highway transportation safety administration &apos;s website -- you can just look at the raw data , and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that &apos;s in favor of car seats for children aged two and up .
but what &apos;s interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much .
i would like you to approve it for selling , &quot; then they would say , &quot; this is a fantastic new car seat , it works great .
and he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them , and he &apos;d say , &quot; come back in a week , if you still feel lousy . &quot;
steven levitt shares data that shows car seats are no more effective than seatbelts in protecting kids from dying in cars . however , during the question and answer session , he makes one crucial caveat .
there &apos;s two million emails per second .
and the cloudbook doesn &apos;t have any storage .
and we see that in things like flickr , or photosynth , this program from microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it .
so that &apos;s what you want , is all your friends are identified , and you should just carry these relationships around .
just like it wasn &apos;t tv and only better .
what i didn &apos;t know though , was most of those people , standing there with me , were moonies .
the bottom picture is hitler youth .
it happens in the human brain . there is no evil force out there to get us .
i have no interest in that whatsoever .
and then the broader ideas of city-making start having direct influences on architecture , on the elements that make up the broader scheme , the buildings themselves , and start guiding us .
well , that immediately turned into something much broader , and as a scope .
what i &apos;m interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people .
well , then we get to this image .
do you -- do you see any canine teeth ?
so this ingenuity of our ancestors , to invent this most marvelous technology .
sweet -- energy .
i took the three elements -- stomach , small intestine and colon .
so if we take two types of signals -- a hunger signal for example .
so our research -- and i think the research also at the universities -- are now fixing on these points to say : how can we actually -- and this might sound trivial now to you -- how can we change cooking ?
all of this is part of our common experience , and this shouldn &apos;t surprise us , because , after all , biologists have finally proven it to be true , something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true .
and en route , we took darshan from rinpoche , and he sat with us and told us about the four noble truths , the essence of the buddhist path .
the intiwatana , the hitching post to the sun , is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light that falls on the sacred apu of machu picchu , which is sugarloaf mountain , called huayna picchu .
fields are planted in such an extraordinary way , that the one side of the field is planted like that by the women .
they dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the younger brothers . they cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the earth .
thank you very much .
i say far less , because 10 percent isn &apos;t going to cut it .
it &apos;s a waste product .
natural polymers , well ... i think that &apos;s what &apos;s most important , because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years , in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans .
another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction , so if you were to take the lid off that bottle , it won &apos;t stay inside .
and this brings me to my modest proposal .
use dancers instead of powerpoint . that &apos;s science writer john bohannon &apos;s &quot; modest proposal . &quot; in this spellbinding choreographed talk he makes his case by example , aided by dancers from black label movement . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
then the pattern , head-tail-tail , that we &apos;ve suddenly become fixated with happens here .
how could that be ?
when you look at dna , there &apos;s a sequence of not two things -- heads and tails -- but four letters -- as , gs , cs and ts .
here &apos;s another quiz for you -- now suppose we &apos;ve got a test for a disease which isn &apos;t infallible , but it &apos;s pretty good .
and at the trial , her trial , a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths , innocent deaths , in a family like hers -- which was professional and non-smoking -- was one in 73 million .
in the disease example , we had to bear in mind two things , one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not .
we can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly -- and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here .
peter donnelly : how juries are fooled by statistics
we call this technology efci , electrical fault circuit interrupter .
this emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy .
so even though china &apos;s is a totally censored internet , but still , chinese internet society is really booming .
the same thing happend . he was the first to topple during the arab spring .
it &apos;s the same content . one , you can see exactly one chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 english tweets .
if you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her .
but i want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat-and-mouse .
they just give them a target window to not censor people .
likewise for hearing .
i &apos;m not saying that they can &apos;t live a beautiful , wonderful life .
jn : i see . and who is that ?
i mean , most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music .
now we &apos;ve been doing some studies to really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users .
and this is of a student of mine named joseph who i had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab .
charles limb : building the musical muscle
in many countries it is a different story .
no german soldier fell to the ground .
in other words , a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control .
that is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in afghanistan .
so how many of you know what i &apos;m talking about ?
paul rothemund : playing with dna that self-assembles
the cracks are too small to get your toes into so the only way to climb is using your fingertips in the cracks , and using opposing pressure and forcing yourself up .
and , i noticed that most inventions fail , not because the r &amp; amp ; d department can &apos;t get it to work -- if you look at most business plans , they will actually succeed if given the opportunity to build what they say they &apos;re going to build -- and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail , because the timing is wrong -- not all the enabling factors will be in place when they &apos;re needed .
so the first step in biological evolution , the evolution of dna -- actually it was rna came first -- took billions of years , but then evolution used that information-processing backbone to bring on the next stage .
that hit a wall . they couldn &apos;t shrink them and keep the vacuum .
and economists have actually started worrying about that .
the amount of genetic data -- basically this shows that smooth exponential growth doubled every year , enabling the genome project to be completed .
where will we get the software ?
computers will combine the subtle pan-recognition powers of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior , in terms of doing analytic thinking , remembering billions of facts accurately .
another update : you will recall i introduced you guys to the quadro tracker .
sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise , once clockwise and peck the key twice .
for example , what do you see here ?
here is what you show subjects .
you think people are talking about you .
and he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal .
even the idea that government can rescue us -- that &apos;s no longer the wave of the future , but that is , i think , a type of agenticity : projecting somebody up there , big and powerful , will come rescue us .
you can use -- which i did , went out and did -- michael persinger &apos;s god helmet , that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves .
and it &apos;s the combination of these things that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization , and , on occasion , has led me to play with fire .
this is data from a skate park , and this is mabel davis skate park in austin , texas .
i think , after 30 years , the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning .
no one knows if he got to the top . it &apos;s still a mystery .
we were both thundering through this incredible siberian dawn , and part of me felt a bit like a cross between jason bourne and wilfred thesiger . part of me felt quite proud of myself , but mostly i was just utterly terrified .
that &apos;s the scale . the red line is obviously halfway to the pole .
what &apos;s the single most important thing you &apos;ve got to convey ?
and you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to get people to follow your lead , to inspire them , to motivate them to be part of your team .
i have invested tens of millions of dollars . &quot;
but if you can do it , it works really , really well .
basically none .
if it &apos;s a website , show me a screenshot of your website .
so hopefully everything has been positive , positive , positive , more positive .
number three : don &apos;t read your speech .
nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from .
beetles , i was reminded , have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom .
now that &apos;s embarrassing , because up until now , every time i &apos;ve said , &quot; i know it like the back of my hand , &quot; i &apos;ve really been saying , &quot; i &apos;m totally familiar with that , i just don &apos;t know it &apos;s freaking name , right ? &quot;
i &apos;m pretty sure my dad doesn &apos;t know it .
where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the oecd ?
in fact , we devalue play .
she passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time -- as the redwood trees -- for that serious meme to get out of our operating system .
in social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
we hold ourselves back .
a doctor might be serious , but laughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
i don &apos;t care when you get in in the morning . i don &apos;t care when you leave .
we &apos;re going to eradicate fear .
steve keil fights the &quot; serious meme &quot; that has infected his home of bulgaria -- and calls for a return to play to revitalize the economy , education and society . a sparkling talk with a universal message for people everywhere who are reinventing their workplaces , schools , lives . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so this whole project was an experiment .
they are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium .
in this particular case , he &apos;s talking about drone strikes .
industrial designers want to make novel things .
after that , it had to be kneaded . it had to then go in , kind of , a mangle .
if i go on like this , you will be here till midnight .
it &apos;s gone .
i didn &apos;t know . i looked at that -- i said , &quot; wow , is that better than the -- &quot; that &apos;s my proposal on jimmy doolittle . i made that movie for television .
obviously a really profound moment , and it changed our lives in many ways .
and instead , when the baby was placed in my hands , it was an extraordinary moment .
i &apos;ll move on to taboo number two .
and i think , miscarriage is an invisible loss .
we trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments .
but then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded .
what i &apos;d like you to hear live is the 1955 version , and we &apos;ll play the first couple pieces of it .
here &apos;s now something we know in spectacular quality .
every time you listen to a recording today , every time you take out your ipod and whatever , every time you listen to it , it &apos;s the same thing -- it &apos;s frozen .
and that &apos;s just what the live audience did .
h.l. mencken once said that , &quot; to every complex problem , there is a simple solution and it &apos;s wrong . &quot;
and , after all this , as the great chinese sage lao tzu said , &quot; governing a great country is like cooking a small fish .
he believed if you see a problem , you shouldn &apos;t tell someone to act , you should act on it yourself , and he lived long enough and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer .
then , people said monarchy dominated everywhere because it was rooted in human nature .
so all the way over on the left of this graph , what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter of their gdp every year , and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdp per year .
a chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an english speaker &apos;s ears .
what you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak futured languages .
and what i &apos;m going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure , and then i &apos;m going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels .
ultimately , the goal , once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making , we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future .
but nevertheless , i was recruited by the british council , along with about 25 other teachers .
&quot; but , &quot; i hear you say , &quot; what about the research ?
so immediately , we &apos;re rejecting them .
and now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home .
but fortunately , henry kramer , who put up the prize for -- that was a one-mile flight -- put up a new prize for flying the english channel , 21 miles .
what &apos;s the population of the earth ?
this enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if she &apos;s sliding along on the ocean waves .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
this delusion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us .
he said , &quot; well what are you doing ? &quot;
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m a useless person and there &apos;s no buddha , no maitreya , and everything is all hopeless .
and he said , &quot; if you don &apos;t believe me , just take me with you . &quot;
and then the buddhists , of course , think that , because we &apos;ve all had infinite previous lives , we &apos;ve all been each other &apos;s relatives , actually .
and this is the way you do it . you take any being who looks weird to you , and you see how they could be familiar to you .
they would be relaxing somewhere having a good time .
never mind . i won &apos;t get into that .
it &apos;s good to start with some examples .
the point is that you get into trouble when you ask a single question with a single box for an answer , in which that single question actually is many questions with quite different meanings , but with the same words .
and then there &apos;s another kind of thing that you might study , and you study that hard .
so that &apos;s the next layer of simplicity , and , in fact , integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they , in general , work really well .
there &apos;s no way of predicting the internet based on the first transistor .
so can you picture that a science of simplicity might get to the point where you could look out at various systems -- say a financial system or a legal system , health system -- and say , &quot; that has got to the point of danger or dysfunctionality for the following reasons , and this is how we might simplify it &quot; ?
and then one of these companies that was importing parts for the clunkers decided to set up in business , start selling them to other people , and gradually another company emerged out of that , marin , and it probably was , i don &apos;t know , 10 , maybe even 15 , years , before the big bike companies realized there was a market .
and when you get a radical innovation , it &apos;s often very uncertain how it can be applied .
and across a whole range of fields -- from software , astronomy , natural sciences , vast areas of leisure and culture like kite-surfing , so on and so forth -- you find people who want to do things because they love it , but they want to do these things to very high standards .
these people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding , because they &apos;re threatened by them .
i think the idea of creating the red cross for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea , but can we really organize that , just on volunteers ?
the best measure of that : so you go into one of his games , you create a character that you develop in the course of the game .
isn &apos;t it amazing ?
so i was so moved by this -- this is incredible . this was connecting , right .
and it makes me think of this .
i &apos;m not alone , and i am loved .
so what i did , i took all those emails , and i put them together into something called angrigami , which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff .
and she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety .
a key thing is that the major violence genes , it &apos;s called the mao-a gene .
okay , now this gives one a little pause .
and if you see those metal bits there -- those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles , so it can measure how fast they &apos;re traveling .
the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons .
but there &apos;s a problem .
and that &apos;s exactly the way the higgs mechanism works .
the universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation .
but i knew that i &apos;d need superpowers to make my dreams come true .
mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically help us understand whether our smile is fake or real , so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler .
for 11 years , i was mayor of tirana , our capital .
they had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place .
we removed the kiosks .
president roosevelt , he said , &quot; believe you can , and you are halfway there . &quot;
we had basically three requirements .
you can find out about places of worship .
we now have the tools . we now have the possibilities .
it &apos;s the whole book .
this digital now is not the present , because it &apos;s always a few seconds ahead , with twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones .
buda and pest were separated by the danube , and vienna had a spanish riding school .
we can choose otherwise .
this is how english my mother is -- or was , she just passed .
but when we were in lisbon , in the airport , about to fly to england , this woman saw my mother wearing this dress , which had been washed so many times it was basically see through , with five really hungry-looking kids , came over and asked her what had happened .
so , this guy comes with me .
and he had smuggled in two comics , two comic books -- &quot; spiderman &quot; and &quot; x-men . &quot;
he pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be , if he were whole .
now the really strange thing is life goes kaput , not once , not twice , but five times .
difference human / neanderthal is sperm and testis , smell and skin .
and we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the united states , except that with the technologies that are coming online today , today &apos;s corrections , deletions , augmentations and enhancements are going to seem like child &apos;s play .
well it &apos;s not completely inconceivable that someday you &apos;ll be able to download your own memories , maybe into a new body .
or maybe it &apos;s chemicals .
so in this picture you see that rotor four is spinning faster and rotor two is spinning slower .
the robots can be used for transporting cargo .
so just like a diver stands on a springboard and then jumps off it to gain momentum , and then does this pirouette , this two and a half somersault through and then gracefully recovers , this robot is basically doing that .
as you can see in this figure-eight flight , they come within inches of each other .
and that &apos;s how it populates this map .
here you can see some pictures of what are called green roofs , or urban agriculture .
and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee health , we can go back to the year 950 and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in ireland .
we &apos;re looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccines , through yogurt , like probiotics , and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees , and this process is so easy , even a 7-year-old can do it .
so this is important .
first of all , a little bit of audience participation .
all that is a real , great improvement , as we shall see .
we added in more sugar .
don &apos;t we all agree ? i certainly agree .
we need clever low-key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we &apos;ve had .
there are different ways in which we must use it -- for residential , for nature , for agriculture purposes .
never before , as i said , has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few .
so if you &apos;re in a building , you can take an elevator .
because those bicycle parts are so ubiquitously available , they &apos;re super-cheap .
the road was too rough .
so , she protects her eggs , and after three months , the babies finally do hatch out .
this &#91; little snake &#93; was kind of a tid-bit for it , what we &apos;d call a &quot; vadai &quot; or a donut or something like that .
well , basically , we dam it , we pollute it , we pour in pesticides , weedicides , fungicides .
but then the monsoon arrives , and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or there is always a barrage , and , shoop , they get washed down to their doom .
you &apos;ll get to see the incredible &#91; chambal &#93; landscape as well .
and these are powerful water totems .
your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself , and much more quickly than people had once realized , if you simply stop doing what &apos;s causing the problem .
it wasn &apos;t a function of how old or how sick they were -- it was mainly how much they changed , and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones .
you &apos;ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth , and &quot; impotence &quot; -- the headline is , &quot; impotent &quot; -- it &apos;s not emphysema .
and fat has nine calories per gram , whereas protein and carbs only have four .
he says , &quot; i &apos;ve got some good news .
the last thing i want to talk about , apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness , is that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely , in part because , as we talked about , they &apos;re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on .
dean ornish : healing through diet
many of you , maybe you &apos;ve seen it or you &apos;ve heard of the story , but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film , the main character , benjamin button , who &apos;s played by brad pitt , is completely computer-generated from the neck up .
so there really was no tolerable margin of error .
and we also needed to make sure that we could take brad &apos;s idiosyncrasies , his little tics , the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in benjamin on the screen .
initially , we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named dr. paul ekman in the early &apos; 70s .
we brought in rick baker , and rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry .
and so we looped the scenes .
so we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years .
a couple of quick factoids ; it really took 155 people over two years , and we didn &apos;t even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut .
and then it started , there was no turning back after that .
and they brought blackboards and chalk .
the guy went up and started dickering , and 10 dollars later , we had four camels .
do you want to roll the film ?
but they use their tails a lot , especially in rut .
one of the other things about the camel &apos;s beautiful design is that its penis points backwards .
leathery chest pads that beat the heat .
&quot; camels are like angels , &quot; a bedouin once said .
and this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places .
narration : &quot; some days . &quot;
who could sleep that night ?
a few centuries later , when he was your age , franz schubert was doing the dishes for his family , but that did not keep him from composing two symphonies , four operas and two complete masses as a youngster .
this is the way bonobos do it . bonobos do everything with sex .
it &apos;s already a big advance over many other animals who wouldn &apos;t be able to do that .
but it shows the intelligence that the elephants have .
people who have problems with empathy , such as autistic children , they don &apos;t have yawn contagion .
so if this chimp makes the selfish choice , which is the red token in this case , he needs to give it to us .
recently we videotaped it with new monkeys who &apos;d never done the task , thinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction , and that turned out to be right .
i think morality is much more than what i &apos;ve been talking about , but it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates , which are empathy and consolation , pro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness .
they won &apos;t stand out , they won &apos;t be ridiculed , but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry .
as i mentioned last year , i grew up with no religion at all .
and my immunologist told me that i should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iphones in my house , because those are just orgies of germs .
it was really a life-changing project .
and it has made me a healthier person .
so there you have it : the evolution of a headline .
like , just a couple of weeks ago , neuroscientists at mit figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain .
and in some cases , oxytocin can even decrease cooperation .
molly crockett : beware neuro-bunk
we don &apos;t know .
and the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of dravidian-speaking people in the north , actually near afghanistan , and they say that perhaps , sometime in the past , dravidian languages were spoken all over india and that this suggests that the indus civilization is perhaps also dravidian .
if i give you the letter q and ask you to predict the next letter , what do you think that would be ?
what about the indus script ?
they used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived , and so in this case , they were traveling by sea all the way to mesopotamia , present-day iraq .
it looks like we &apos;re getting somewhere .
how many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star ?
watson was in fact listening to very low-frequency radio emissions caused by nature .
they were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity .
and we &apos;re all still trying to , i guess we &apos;re all trying to become tedsters , if that &apos;s a modern form of enlightenment .
imagine if i had to feel even a hundred other people &apos;s suffering .
i won &apos;t even say what they do . but he feels it .
this is kim , a nine-year-old vietnam girl , her back ruined by napalm , and she awakened the conscience of the nation of america to begin to end the vietnam war .
they won public opinion over a long period of time .
we cannot solve these problems unless we work together .
and we never did .
see any common themes ? principles ?
now , the question we had is , how general is a distributed foot ?
when you touched the cockroach leg -- can you get the microphone for him ?
dan koditschek put some steel nails -- very simple version -- on the robot , and here &apos;s rhex , now , going over those steel -- those rails . no problem !
so to our blueprint , let &apos;s attach claws .
it has a hundred to a thousand split ends , and that &apos;s the secret , because it allows intimate contact .
so the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right , attempt to make that climb , and ultimately put it on the robot .
they can produce loud clicks and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient .
how about the setting in which animals need to use this call ?
when there was one boat , not much of an impact .
it had deep underwater microphones , or hydrophones , cabled to shore , all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole north atlantic .
the next recording you &apos;re going to hear was made of the same humpback song 50 miles away .
it &apos;s louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers .
and i &apos;m happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area , looking at the impact of shipping on whales .
but then they often wait there .
we see black holes at the heart of our galaxy , in the milky way , and elsewhere in the universe , where time itself seems to stand still .
so basically , kids of all ages , like us .
the old shyness was a fear of rejection .
but who should care ? the only people who should care about this is parents of boys and girls , educators , gamers , filmmakers and women who would like a real man who they can talk to , who can dance , who can make love slowly and contribute to the evolutionary pressures to keep our species above banana slugs .
again , i can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around .
i can create big things out here , but i can go back and really quickly go back to where i started , and make even smaller things here .
this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it , and i &apos;m really looking forward to interacting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields .
we are a country of victims .
but , fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something .
it &apos;s pacific , coordinated civil action , which doesn &apos;t mean passive action .
that devotion we show in helping victims of disasters , such as the earthquake in 1985 or this year &apos;s floods .
and as a golfer and as a kid , one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores , that i sort of lived my whole life , is process .
juggling three balls is simple and normal .
make it narrower .
a little bit faster .
you &apos;ve got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life . ok ?
thanks . the only thing i &apos;ll say about the last session is , you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at 120 miles an hour ?
i &apos;m actually leading up to something , the newest thing that i &apos;m working on . this is not it .
but i really like it , it feels right .
and that meant actually designing custom technology as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use .
behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human . ) david kelley : so here &apos;s the final thing , complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across -- that follows the tracks of the sun -- across the sky .
he found himself in kenya on a fulbright and he had a very interesting insight , which is that he said , &quot; there must be entrepreneurs in kenya ; there must be entrepreneurs everywhere . &quot;
so , we can see the stars and the planets , but we can &apos;t see what holds them apart or what draws them together .
but we can &apos;t read each other &apos;s minds . i find that quite astonishing .
because that &apos;s where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are .
100 billion . how many can we see ? five .
in fact , we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words .
we took a page out of xkcd , and we said , &quot; stand back .
so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide .
we are losing interest in the past more rapidly .
there are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been .
this person studies all the &quot; arghs , &quot; from one through eight a &apos;s .
and then there is a whole range of filters .
and the art of conversation is being replaced -- dangerously , i think -- by personal broadcasting .
it &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
but i believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully -- connected in space and in time to the physical world around us , connected in understanding to each other , not to mention spiritually connected , because every spiritual path i know of has listening and contemplation at its heart .
and for the economists out there , you may be interested to know i actually made a pretty predictable income , which was shocking to me given i had no regular customers , but pretty much 60 bucks on a tuesday , 90 bucks on a friday .
is this what stupid people do ?
and the goal was 100,000 dollars .
i see them as trust .
two weeks after my speech , in tunisia , hundreds of portraits were made .
education is so essential .
but this was , i have to admit , all an accident .
one is -- the most basic one is -- people like to know things .
and it &apos;s also , although the brain looks very complicated , things look complicated until you understand them .
so what is the intuitive , but incorrect assumption , that &apos;s kept us from understanding brains ?
and these things happen all the time . you &apos;re making these predictions .
so what will brain theory look like ?
i &apos;m actually here to make a challenge to people .
it is saving the tigers .
i don &apos;t believe in the hope of change , unless we take action to make it so . &quot;
this is rigoberta menchu tum .
and grandma pushed the button , and she said , &quot; oh , fantastic !
and there &apos;s nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma .
population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman .
if you have democracy , people will vote for washing machines .
they freak out .
&#91; 27 % of subjects &apos; first 5 ssn digits identified &#93; but in fact , we even decided to develop an iphone app which uses the phone &apos;s internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what i just described to you in real time : looking for a match , finding public information , trying to infer sensitive information , and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject , an example of augmented reality , probably a creepy example of augmented reality .
now , that movie is set in 2054 , about 40 years from now , and as exciting as that technology looks , it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you , and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect .
in fact , i want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives .
even more so than george orwell , the author is , of course , aldous huxley .
but the paradox is , when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode , that social awareness vanishes and they start talking like accountants .
and sometimes you can see them at vacation places like jackson hole or aspen .
it tells us what to imprint .
they are what we call avoidantly attached .
any child can say , &quot; i &apos;m a tiger , &quot; pretend to be a tiger .
david brooks : the social animal
i don &apos;t remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it .
we think it is easy money .
and therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world , very easily , and not feel very shy about it .
they need your empathy .
lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
i do not have that hat . i wish i had that hat .
she says , &quot; i don &apos;t know , my mom always did it ! &quot;
it doesn &apos;t make a word any more real than any other way .
if this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of american english -- look , we have a kind of lumpy idea of florida , but there &apos;s no california !
but the thing is , we could make the dictionary the whole language .
and worse than that , far worse than that , my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating .
every mental organ addressed . it really is .
titus was a restaurant manager .
i study memory . i &apos;ve studied memory for decades .
and as part of this training exercise , these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive , hostile , physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes and later on they have to try to identify the person who conducted that interrogation .
i published an exposé on the case , and a little while later , the accusing daughter filed a lawsuit .
if i &apos;ve learned anything from these decades of working on these problems , it &apos;s this : just because somebody tells you something and they say it with confidence , just because they say it with lots of detail , just because they express emotion when they say it , it doesn &apos;t mean that it really happened .
what if i told you that the two-meter positioning that our current cell phones and our tomtoms give us is pathetic compared to what we could be getting ?
well , so did i .
they go on to jam innocent gps receivers for miles around you .
they have no encryption . they have no authentication .
maybe you &apos;ll have a whole bag full of them .
and of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
so we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance , and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us , using a camera that could look at people in the room , track them and replace one person with the background , rendering them invisible .
and it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall , because if we made it in a way that it would topple over , then it would damage itself , and if it didn &apos;t fall enough , it wouldn &apos;t instill that fatalism , or that sense of wanting to go and help it .
with nuclear , those who know the most are the least worried .
the power lines are getting overloaded .
mark jacobson : thank you .
if you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol , you &apos;d actually increase the death rate slightly .
that &apos;s cellulosic , second generation biofuels from prairie grass .
and i want two of each for the mics .
however , i think there may be a win-win solution here where both parties can win this debate , and that is , we face a situation where it &apos;s carbon caps on this planet or die .
anyone else against ?
shameless . shameless . shameless .
the story was a bestseller .
in just 30 years , china went from one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world to its second-largest economy .
for example , term limits .
they form separate yet integrated career paths for chinese officials .
before becoming governor of texas , or barack obama before running for president , could not make even a small county manager in china &apos;s system .
now , i don &apos;t want to create the misimpression that china &apos;s hunky-dory , on the way to some kind of superpowerdom .
china &apos;s political model will never supplant electoral democracy , because unlike the latter , it doesn &apos;t pretend to be universal .
are you happy with the garbage collection ?
in fact , i think in the next decade , without any question , we will discover life on mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous under the soils and different parts of that planet .
we &apos;ve done two so far . we &apos;ll be announcing two more on the soyuz to go up to the space station for 20 million dollars .
richard searfoss : good luck .
for a chance to win the first free ticket to space , look for specially marked packages of diet 7-up .
we &apos;re looking at attacking energy , environment , nanotechnology -- and i &apos;ll talk about those more in a moment .
i don &apos;t think it does make a morally relevant difference .
but if i &apos;m not , what can i do ?
it costs about 40,000 dollars to train a guide dog and train the recipient so that the guide dog can be an effective help to a blind person .
i think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what i call the sisyphus problem .
what kind of forms could we design if we wouldn &apos;t work with references anymore ?
so we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we &apos;re making the fold , but essentially you &apos;re looking at a folded cube .
i chose to design a column .
for me , or for my purpose at this moment , there &apos;s still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale , on the one hand , and resolution and speed , on the other .
but look what happened in the course of that century .
here it is . that &apos;s the same kid .
sb : well , research on progeria has come so far in less than 15 years , and that just shows the drive that researchers can have to get this far , and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with progeria , and it shows that if that drive exists , anybody can cure any disease , and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future , and so we can eliminate those 4,000 diseases that francis was talking about .
here you see a picture of a lung on a chip .
both myself and my brother belong to the under 30 demographic , which pat said makes 70 percent , but according to our statistics it makes 60 percent of the region &apos;s population .
and i &apos;m sure , although we can &apos;t see the people in washington , they are in the same position .
she lives in new york city , but she doesn &apos;t try to be a western artist .
girl : uncle khaled . here , put on the headscarf .
familiarity destroys and trumps fear . try it .
so i told her .
and he says to me &quot; willard , can you put my house on a pinhead ? &quot;
because it &apos;s such a small sculpture , nothing can go wrong .
i experimented with a -- i found a dead fly .
and she saw me walking around like this .
that ship there , that &apos;s made from 24-karat gold .
&quot; it &apos;s me , &quot; or , more grammatically correctly , &quot; it is i , &quot; as we might say in english .
jung may have called it &quot; the subconscious . &quot;
what did it mean that he was dead ?
now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong , ways in which we miscalculate , misjudge , distort reality , or see what we want to see , and the bias i &apos;m talking about works like this : confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn &apos;t true and they can , instead , live forever , even if it means taking the existential elevator .
so 100 years ago , hormones had just been discovered , and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to cure aging and disease , and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells , genetic engineering , and nanotechnology .
i want to live on in my apartment . &quot;
thank you .
i have cancer .
she &apos;s got a big smile . she &apos;s got a big personality .
and jeff came up beside me and said , &quot; so , have you ever been cow tipping ? &quot;
and if you did see the sanjay special , you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis .
and one night my daughter eden came to me .
i was on crutches , my wife was next to me , my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead .
as i looked at this list -- to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living -- i realized , we may have done it for our girls , but it really changed us .
and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe , you know , in his brain something was stirring , some sort of musical gift .
this is a photo of you , derek , playing at the barbican with the royal philharmonic pops .
ao : derek , let &apos;s have a bow .
derek &apos;s going to l.a. soon , and it &apos;s a milestone , because it means that derek and i will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together , which is quite interesting , isn &apos;t it derek ?
derek paravicini and adam ockelford : in the key of genius
i have no idea . i don &apos;t know what that thing is .
i came directly here from the deep , deep tropical rainforest in ecuador , where i was out -- you could only get there by a plane -- with indigenous people with paint on their faces and parrot feathers on their headdresses , where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies , and keep the roads , out of their forests .
so in many , many ways , we can do things today that we couldn &apos;t do when i began in 1960 .
it &apos;s a very wuzzy line .
this means that although for hundreds , perhaps thousands of years , people have lived in those forests , or whatever habitat it is , in harmony with their world , just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now , suddenly , because of the roads , the hunters can go in from the towns .
do you know we all have about 50 chemicals in our bodies we didn &apos;t have about 50 years ago ?
every one of us impacts the world around us everyday , and you scientists know that you can &apos;t actually -- even if you stay in bed all day , you &apos;re breathing oxygen and giving out co2 , and probably going to the loo , and things like that -- you &apos;re making a difference in the world .
no violence , no bombs , no guns .
we are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible .
life also has a metabolism . now this is a process by which life can convert resources from the environment into building blocks so it can maintain and build itself .
so just through self-assembly , mixing things together in the lab , we can come up with , say , a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body , right ?
and we just put these two together in the same system .
these are very dirty little protocells , as a matter of fact .
and i would use this study , a recent study by philip landrigan , to motivate a different view of health , where he went to most of the pediatricians in manhattan and the new york area and logged what they spent their patient hours on .
and of course , these endocrine disruptors are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic , the obesity epidemic , the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls and other related things .
there &apos;s an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones -- which dials the clinic , we go and pick up the mouse .
and they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared , uncertain , collective threat .
but we &apos;ve kind of lacked imagination in how we could do that well or interestingly .
when the buoys get your text , they wink at you twice to say , we &apos;ve got your message .
what &apos;s crazy is what we do today .
now how do we do it ?
what could the future of animal products look like ?
and 750 million people in the world today own a car .
the vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength in creating the hydrogen .
and the key to all of this is to make it affordable , to make it exciting , to get it on a pathway where there &apos;s a way to make money doing it .
man , her office was packed .
and then i told them , &quot; i want to be a teacher . &quot;
well , we &apos;re making school worth coming to every day .
there i learned different things .
and léila came up with an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
the only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing , always , even if we reduce them , everything that we do , we produce co2 , are the trees .
my colleagues and i have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project .
and it &apos;s this map you see here .
if we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time .
so we just started making a list .
you can see this for yourself on our website .
we can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time , that they really are the same place , that there is no way that cities can escape from nature .
if everybody on the planet lived the way we did , we &apos;d need between five , six , seven , some people even say 10 planets to make it .
and they are doing density , new density , better than probably anybody else on the planet right now .
there &apos;s also neo-biological design , where more and more we &apos;re actually using life itself and the processes of life to become part of our industry .
we tweak that a lot .
this is a fabulous invention , lifestraw .
and it &apos;s a copyright violation .
and this freaked the media businesses out -- it freaked them out every time .
so in order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits , the dmca also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices .
you don &apos;t have millions and millions of dollars , but you can call your representatives , and you can remind them that you vote , and you can ask not to be treated like a thief , and you can suggest that you would prefer that the internet not be broken .
what does a bill like pipa / sopa mean to our shareable world ? at the offices , clay shirky delivers a proper manifesto -- a call to defend our freedom to create , discuss , link and share , rather than passively consume .
in fact , it &apos;s got many , many different computers inside of it , more pentiums than my lab did when i was in college , and they &apos;re connected by a wired network .
they were able to take over a bunch of critical computers inside the car : the brakes computer , the lighting computer , the engine , the dash , the radio , etc . , and they were able to perform these on real commercial cars that they purchased using the radio network .
let me advance the slide , and now i &apos;ll go back .
don &apos;t waste computer cycles .
and then i thought out of curiosity i &apos;d like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like .
so the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice .
it was built by 12 barefoot architects who can &apos;t read and write , built on $ 1.50 a sq. ft .
he knows more about solar than anyone i know anywhere in the world guaranteed .
and they actually monitor and supervise 150 schools for 7,000 children .
all across the globe , you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate .
and they haven &apos;t collapsed .
they said , &quot; why ? she doesn &apos;t know the language . you don &apos;t know her . &quot;
with my visual artist colleagues , we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space , visually and sonically .
the white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration .
let &apos;s see how your experience simulators are working .
unlike sir thomas , you seem not to know it .
it &apos;s &quot; glorious , &quot; a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience .
i want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for .
ok ? they remember their childhood , but if you walk in and introduce yourself , and then leave the room , when you come back , they don &apos;t know who you are .
they &apos;re not just saying it because they own it , because they don &apos;t know they own it .
we created a photography course , a black-and-white photography course , and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom .
because the reversible condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness .
by day , i &apos;m a venture capitalist . on weekends , i love rockets .
they &apos;re yelling deploy . voices : oh shit .
and i told her i was coming to ted , and she said , &quot; what &apos;s the problem ? &quot;
there are stories you tell from stages .
&quot; ma &apos;am , did you know that was a light you just ran ? &quot;
&quot; can you even see ? &quot;
it &apos;ll help my breathing . it &apos;ll do something for my pulse , maybe .
but that doesn &apos;t happen most of the time , right ?
&quot; look , the chevy -- he &apos;s coming this way . &quot;
she listens , because that &apos;s what people who tell stories do first .
we all secretly want our blankie and our boo bear .
&quot; no . i gave it up with pantyhose -- they &apos;re both too binding . &quot;
storyteller carmen agra deedy spins a funny , wise and luminous tale of parents and kids , starring her cuban mother . settle in and enjoy the ride -- mama &apos;s driving !
so , how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles ?
so , i want to move now to the second part of my story , which is : when are we going to start doing this congestion pricing ? road pricing is coming .
where would we expect me , robin chase , to be thinking is imagine if we put a mesh-network device in every single car across america .
and they got here in the late 1960s .
on a sunday night .
none of us can predict the future , but we do know one thing about it and that &apos;s that it ain &apos;t gonna go according to plan .
in his deeply authentic self , he also loved needlepoint .
and it &apos;s a great story , because what happened was he got off the plane at the toronto airport , and he was welcomed by a non-profit group , which i &apos;m sure someone in this room runs .
there are so many things to be happy about .
there &apos;s a new place in new york where the crowds are thickest -- ground zero .
your work is highly sensual , even hedonistic .
we finished ps 234 , and had dinner with a small group .
they were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there , that had nowhere to go .
sort of like the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little stonehenge , i guess ?
one of the other things is this is designed to be moveable .
but it had some really terrible ideas .
and essentially our structure was designed to be written on .
so my baby , vander , is eight years old now .
so given all of that and given how darn neurotic i am , how do i get any sleep at all ?
there are some great resources out there .
so i just want to tell you my story .
and i &apos;m not comfortable with that .
in reality , it is one of its greatest allies .
thirty-four million are infected with hiv .
and this is how it works : patent holders , inventors that develop new medicines patent those inventions , but make those patents available to the medicines patent pool . the medicines patent pool then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents .
thank you .
so why is that ?
natural-watered lawn is a very good cooling source stabilizing temperature , and using dehumidified air to create comfort .
where we are looking to find alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society .
even here in doha i found this little nook where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed , and it &apos;s a lot of tiny little parts . it &apos;s not easy .
so we said , &quot; what can we do to empower this teacher to do more ? &quot; how to access the digital world ?
it &apos;s about this little device called a medi-meter .
so ...
&amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; new york times &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ; tech columnist david pogue performs a satirical mini-medley about itunes and the downloading wars , borrowing a few notes from sonny and cher and the village people .
it &apos;s 2,200 people in the year 2000 .
and we found that if your friend becomes obese , it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent in the same given time period .
and so , i came to see these kinds of social networks as living things , as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope to study and analyze and understand .
again , a social network , but now we color the people yellow if they &apos;re happy and blue if they &apos;re sad and green in between .
if you talk to them , and you said , &quot; what is your social life like ? &quot;
but if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way , you get diamond , which is clear and hard .
sometimes i &apos;m concerned that we hear about it so much that we &apos;ve come to accept longer lives with a kind of a complacency , even ease .
after all , aging is not a piece of cake .
but as social scientists , we continue to ask about possible alternatives .
culture will .
then one night , military trucks drive up to our house .
with these sacrifices , greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided a collapse .
my european counterparts , some of them , at least , said , &quot; you can &apos;t do this .
so how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora ?
help us understand how you felt after the decision .
they could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row .
i think of like , transformers , like how panels open and then they fold , they fold in , and then you close that panel .
so let &apos;s look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain , and know that when you see these people &apos;s faces that these are not just images of the lakota ; they stand for all indigenous people .
in addition , the military issued orders forbidding western indians from leaving reservations .
most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers .
as payment for the black hills , the court awarded only 106 million dollars to the sioux nation .
is any of this your responsibility today ?
this solution has been called , by some , &quot; potentially the most important medical advance this century . &quot;
i &apos;ll start with insulin , diabetes medication in the u.s .
that &apos;s complex , but it &apos;s manageable .
how much does the ball cost ? quick .
what is all this telling us ?
which one of these people has done more for the environment ?
and i think maybe i &apos;m being too negative .
&quot; you &apos;re doing worse . &quot; frown .
i mean , it sometimes feels , listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically , what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time .
and these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play-dough -- pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen .
and now i can start talking about parallel and series circuits .
we do them for our clients .
my favorite topic is shortcuts .
now , i need an assistant .
i start with three queens .
so here : 10 , jack , queen , king , ace .
when i &apos;m sober , i do this much quicker , but we will check .
now i go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern .
so i will do it quick , very quick , but in slow motion , so you can follow .
lg : queen of hearts , yeah .
they didn &apos;t ?
i try to do this right here . first , i take the spades .
lg : extra large , ok .
aargh !
diamonds -- i &apos;ll start with ace of diamonds .
lg : four . is five the next card ?
and queen ! queen , with misdirection .
now , if he practices for a year and takes lessons , he &apos;s now eight and he sounds like this .
now comes the third group .
composers know that . if they want sad music , they just play those two notes .
and what you &apos;re going to see is one-buttock playing .
now , how would you walk -- because you know , my profession , the music profession doesn &apos;t see it that way .
thank you , thank you .
it &apos;s an awesome idea . doesn &apos;t work .
it dulls thinking and blocks creativity .
that routine , rule-based , left-brain work -- certain kinds of accounting , certain kinds of financial analysis , certain kinds of computer programming -- has become fairly easy to outsource , fairly easy to automate .
in madurai , a reward that is modest in north american standards , is more meaningful there .
mastery : the desire to get better and better at something that matters .
they have autonomy over their time , their task , their team , their technique .
this is the titanic battle between these two approaches .
but in this case because the interior is free-swinging in relation to the sphere , it can stand up on one point .
these are these arrays . these spheres are all suspended , but they have magnets horizontally in them that make them all like compasses .
but this the current version of it , is a flying airship that is about 35 meters in diameter , about 110 feet in diameter .
and so interacting with the same kind of imagery .
and so if we really want , like buckminster fuller said , a world that works for everyone , with no one and nothing left out , then the nonprofit sector has to be a serious part of the conversation .
but i don &apos;t want my donations spent on advertising .
and the last area is profit itself .
but it absolutely is , especially if it &apos;s being used for growth .
that &apos;s about 300 billion dollars a year .
something like this , not very pomp , not very sophisticated , this .
um , he was happy .
audience : aaaaaaah ... itay talgam : come on , with me . if you do it without me i feel even more redundant than i already feel .
it &apos;s not true . when he was a young man of about 30 , he wrote what he called &quot; the ten commandments for conductors . &quot;
because you didn &apos;t know when to play .
no , it &apos;s not , because he is not telling them what to do .
can we have the next video , quickly ?
and the level in which kleiber is in control is in a different level .
itay talgam : lead like the great conductors
there are 98 oil-producing nations in the world .
there is the idea of hitting the wall , that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse .
people have a huge amount of fun doing this , reconnecting with other people as they do it .
some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects , like community-supported agriculture schemes , urban food production , creating local food directories , and so on .
because i think stories are vital here .
here &apos;s the overall picture .
so you get a big squeeze .
well in order to accommodate that , you would have to cut education spending in half .
everybody has an opinion .
it &apos;s a great country with lots of people .
and he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to , and that for me , medical school could wait , but that the violin simply would not .
keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
i thought my idea was pretty good , but his idea is genius , and at the time , i knew his idea was better than mine , but i just couldn &apos;t explain why .
these people i still do hang out with .
finally , i have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet .
perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted or for the thoroughly and professionally trained .
for example , a kid says , &quot; mom , guess what ? i met an alien on my way home . &quot;
i was in jeju island a few days ago .
they don &apos;t draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family .
later , i grew up and went to europe &apos;s galleries -- i was a university student -- and i thought this was really unfair .
usually they sound awful . awful indeed .
in this course , all students must put on a play .
why we cannot be something is not important .
that &apos;s the world i dream of .
the right answer , confirmed by the soviet venera spacecraft , was that venus was very hot -- 900 degrees fahrenheit .
by then we had two grandchildren , sophie and connor .
that may not sound like much , but when added up over the whole world , it &apos;s enormous .
the physics does not change .
an important impact , if global warming continues , will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world , the midwest and great plains , which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts , worse than the dust bowl , within just a few decades , if we let global warming continue .
if we wait 10 years , it is 15 percent per year -- extremely difficult and expensive , perhaps impossible .
my favorite and a real hero of mine is yakima canutt .
showing how stunts work in different areas , really .
even then , i caught seven g and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in .
and again , technology meant that i could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters , and stop within a couple of feet of the ground without melting the rope with the friction , because of the alloys i used in the descender device .
he sent me an email , saying , &quot; if you get this thing off the ground i wish you all the best . &quot; and he signed it , &quot; happy landings , &quot; which i thought was quite lovely .
that &apos;s in new mexico .
i would like to bring costa on , if he &apos;s here , to show you the only one of its kind in the world .
but i also had noticed that it wasn &apos;t working .
and part of my journey , starting on this stage , going to &quot; lean in , &quot; going to the foundation , is all about being more open and honest about those challenges , so that other women can be more open and honest , and all of us can work together towards real equality .
now i know there aren &apos;t a lot of men here , but bear with me .
everywhere i go , women tell me they ask for raises .
men only .
we shy away from the word &quot; feminist , &quot; a word i really think we need to embrace .
when ice packed like that starts to move , we call it a glacier , and we give it a name .
now later this summer , as more snow melted off the glacier , we found more caves , and we realized they were all connected .
this duck died on the surface of the glacier long , long ago , and its feathers have finally made it down through over 100 feet of ice before falling inside the cave .
and wherever they went , they killed .
this is all true .
so clearly , from the inside , we are doing our best to change our image , and it &apos;s exploding .
let &apos;s start with leukemia , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , all , the most common cancer of children .
but you can see actually they are further down this list , and that &apos;s because we &apos;re talking here about disability .
we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports our own minds .
that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders , brain circuit disorders , has a behavioral disorder .
and yet , india has nearly the highest teacher absenteeism in the world , with one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year .
girl : i like adventurous books , and some of my favorites are alfred hitchcock and &#91; unclear &#93; and hardy boys .
can you teach us ? &quot; so , we started an afterschool for our parents , for our mothers .
my accent with english improved a lot .
he was begging by a bus stop a few years ago , got picked up and is now in an orphanage , has been coming to school for the last four and a half months .
and he graduated with his doctorate from harvard , and he set up a little consulting shop in white plains , new york .
and they would say , you know , &quot; move ! next ! &quot;
now , did he look for the most popular brand variety of spaghetti sauce ? no !
what do you like ? dark , rich , hearty roast !
there is no good mustard or bad mustard .
psychologists , medical scientists , economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave .
maybe that &apos;s because you don &apos;t actually have acne .
they want a treatment . they want to be told , this is what you have and this is how you treat it . if the doctor doesn &apos;t give you that , you go somewhere else .
so , dad graduated harvard in 1946 , married my mom , and bought a house in lexington , massachusetts , where the first shots were fired against the british in 1775 , although we didn &apos;t actually hit any of them until concord .
and it probably applies just as much to music and to movies and to fine art , which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all , or for that matter , nothing to do with our conference theme of &quot; inspired by nature &quot; -- except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives the ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him , but then the scorpion does sting him anyway and they both die , but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says , &quot; because it &apos;s my nature &quot; -- in that sense , yes .
it &apos;s a different shape , but other than that it &apos;s the same basic limitation .
and as great as these books were , you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect .
and also because that &apos;s where , in terms of our own self-interest , we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond , our responsibility to the rest of the world .
three things i &apos;ve tried to avoid my entire life .
so we started talking about climate change .
and i said &quot; i &apos;m playing the cello and i &apos;m doing a bit of singing , &quot; and he said , &quot; oh , i sort of play the cello as well . &quot;
it &apos;s what right-thinking designers and all the clients are striving for .
and there &apos;s something wonderful about that form of youth , where you can let yourself grow and play , and be really a brat , and then accomplish things .
they &apos;re better crafted than the public theater was , and they spend more money on them , but i think that that moment comes and goes .
they were pretty serious , too . it was quite wonderful .
i was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show , which is not where i started with these things .
after speaking at ted2007 on elegance in physics , the amazing murray gell-mann gives a quick overview of another passionate interest : finding the common ancestry of our modern languages .
so i was just intrigued with what -- you know , what is this animal &apos;s story ?
how do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world .
and the molas there , you can find them with a spotter plane very easily , and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp .
but also what &apos;s important is that they &apos;re not slacker , lazy fish .
and today , 45 years later , we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective , but what we do have is improved technology .
and the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case .
if you have another 30 or 40 seconds , and you have another 30 or 40 seconds , and we just see that , i just think -- i can feel it . we want to hear a little more .
vishnu gave his judgment .
no . it breaks through those .
so what do you do ? do you let them die ?
all the germs from the water we take .
want to kill that cyclist on the way to work , and string up your cousin &apos; cause she &apos;s such a jerk . oh , dear .
we need to break down our vision of what planners are , of what the correct way of a path is .
but the princess said , &quot; father , mother , don &apos;t worry .
he built this machine , and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works , with these little bits . and it &apos;s an idea that goes way back .
von neumann , and a logician , and a mathematician from the army put this together . then , they needed a place to build it .
&quot; impossible to follow the damn thing , where &apos;s a directory ? &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember a mac that was 16 megahertz , that &apos;s slow speed .
so he designed this universe , and ran it .
he was thinking far ahead , to how this would really grow into a new kind of life .
we , the adults of the last four generations , have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents .
we need it . the time is now .
you see , the thing is obesity and diet-related disease doesn &apos;t just hurt the people that have it ; it &apos;s all of their friends , families , brothers , sisters .
portion size is obviously a massive , massive problem .
ok ?
we don &apos;t teach kids about food . right ?
because someone at the milk board , right -- and don &apos;t get me wrong , i support milk -- but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings and colorings and sugar in milk , right , more kids will drink it . yeah .
how much money do you spend , in your life , in a supermarket ?
you know , it &apos;s now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff .
businesses of america need to support mrs. obama to do the things that she wants to do .
being a victim of hacking for a change .
and so nothing is going into the hackers .
we had a champagne decade for people who we know as carders .
max vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of santa clara , california in the late 90s for private companies and voluntarily for the fbi .
how would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole ?
for instance , here in atlanta , about half of households make between $ 20,000 and $ 50,000 a year , and they are spending 29 percent of their income on housing and 32 percent on transportation .
it turns out , all sorts of things .
when metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site , the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new main street , several apartments and condo buildings , while keeping the existing office buildings .
you want to also try to get more systemic transformation .
where should we be redeveloping ?
but we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to .
it sounds like an infection at best . maybe a medical instrument .
there &apos;re three qualities i want to talk about .
and that closing-off closed off my vitality and my life energy .
she gave up her life ; she moved to juarez ; she started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women .
anyway , we arrived , and when we arrived , there were hundreds of girls dressed in red , homemade dresses -- which is the color of the masai and the color of v-day -- and they greeted us , and they had made up these songs that they were singing about the end of suffering , and the end of mutilation , and they walked us down the path .
he was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead and whose grandchildren lived far away .
and there , mr. teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success , especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit .
in his eighties , mr. teszler , having retired from the textile industry , adopted wofford college , auditing courses every semester , and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved , becoming affectionately known as &quot; opi &quot; -- which is magyar for grandfather -- by all and sundry . before i got there , the library of the college had been named for mr. teszler , and after i arrived in 1993 , the faculty decided to honor itself by naming mr. teszler professor of the college -- partly because at that point he had already taken all of the courses in the catalog , but mainly because he was so conspicuously wiser than any one of us .
it was he who broke the mayan codex , enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the mayan script .
this is what i &apos;m passionate about . it is precisely this .
how is it used ?
we live in an age of ubiquitous information , and sort of &quot; just add water &quot; expertise , but there &apos;s nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well-told narrative , what the curator does , the interpretation of a complex , esoteric subject , in a way that retains the integrity of the subject , that makes it -- unpacks it for a general audience .
bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time , across space , whose lives may have been very different to our own , but who , like us , had hopes and dreams , frustrations and achievements in their lives . and i think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves , helps us make better decisions about where we &apos;re going .
that &apos;s the camp that we have in now 90,000 people , where 75 percent of them are women and children .
so we came up with these two rules .
now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other , who are not fighting .
here &apos;s the reason , or not the reason , but here &apos;s why i ask that question .
we had more exploration ships down there during captain cook &apos;s time than now . it &apos;s amazing .
because it &apos;s along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating .
we mounted an expedition to look for the missing heat .
so , i began designing a new technology of telepresence , using robotic systems to replicate myself , so i wouldn &apos;t have to cycle my vehicle system .
finding the state of preservation .
this is that part of the united states that lies beneath the sea .
the game is not over -- it &apos;s over by the eighth grade , it &apos;s not beginning .
finally , even for those who do manage to get the higher education , the doors of opportunity might not open .
paul offit : ... vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus .
you can break up the material , for example , into these short , modular units of eight to 12 minutes , each of which represents a coherent concept .
we can grade models , whether it &apos;s financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments .
this is the san francisco study group , but there were ones all over the world .
imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students would be above average .
by having this amazing content be available , we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted , whether it &apos;s just to expand our minds or it &apos;s to change our lives .
i don &apos;t feel i can afford a relapse .
and they got very upset .
&quot; the act of a master taking painful contemptuous possession of her , was the kind of rapture she wanted .
so this subject-object thing , is part of something i &apos;m very interested in because this is why , frankly , i believe in political correctness .
and so i wanted something that was more interactive .
it only takes two years to learn how to talk .
that , and i will say this to the scientists , that the trickster has the ability to hold his ideas lightly so that he can let room in for new ideas or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems with his ideas .
and the mother is elderly .
thank you very much .
and the world health organization also says that depression is the biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced .
thank god you can all read !
we &apos;re going to have to say , no more logging in the amazon for 20 years .
this is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn .
one percent doesn &apos;t sound like a lot , but it would cause one hell of an ice age here .
we gotta fix that . we gotta outlaw that right away .
astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years .
but it &apos;s going to take them 10 years , at spending three million dollars a year , and even then , they claim they &apos;ll only have about 80 percent of them catalogued .
thank you .
it &apos;s not the kuril arc . it &apos;s not even the entire pacific .
and part of the issue is for cody -- who &apos;s here , 16 years old -- and i have permission to relay this number .
it &apos;s a new world .
here &apos;s what this system is going to look like that we are funded to build at this point .
we pump the fluid through one of these systems , and we press the button , and it &apos;s analyzed for the genomic character .
so let me leave you then with a few words from another poet , if you &apos;ll forgive me .
if you think of the great buildings , of the cathedrals , of the temples , of the pyramids , of pagodas , of cities in india and beyond , you think of how incredible this is that that was realized not by some abstract idea , but by people .
so again , radical versus conservative .
because i believe that the hand in all its primitive , in all its physiological obscurity , has a source , though the source is unknown , though we don &apos;t have to be mystical about it .
unexpected versus habitual .
it tells a story . the story can reach into obscure desires .
and of course , at ground zero what else ?
daniel libeskind : 17 words of architectural inspiration
and then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size .
i mean , right now , if you &apos;ve got a short commute , you can drive , you can get back , you can charge it at home .
em : no , we actually are . you can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system .
so effectively it &apos;s the first time there &apos;s been competition for this monopoly , because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines , but now it &apos;s on your roof .
so you &apos;ve somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by 75 percent , depending on how you calculate it .
so progress on this &quot; let &apos;s make it reusable , &quot; how is that going ? that was just a simulation video we saw .
it &apos;s really counterintuitive .
a himba is one of the 29 ethnic groups in namibia .
then in the same time , around 1980 , we had a very big drought .
and thus , as people started feeling ownership over wildlife , wildlife numbers started coming back , and that &apos;s actually becoming a foundation for conservation in namibia .
with these assets we are now part of the global village .
we were successful in namibia because we dreamed of a future that was much more than just a healthy wildlife .
great for fishermen . lots of money . supporting local economies .
jamie oliver is campaigning to save america from the way we eat .
they got more calories over the course of a diversified meal .
this is still how i largely eat today .
in the extreme ice survey , we &apos;re dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together , to merging the art and science to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity &apos;s relationship with nature better .
well , within about three weeks , i incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras into 25 time-lapse cameras .
we have a site on google earth that google earth was generous enough to give us , and so forth , because we feel very much the need to tell this story , because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now .
you see the glacier flowing in from the right , dropping off into the sea , camera shooting every hour .
this camera was shooting every hour .
we go back a couple years in time .
huge icebergs rolling over .
now , the western elites , however , have said this fear is misplaced .
and specifically , there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of india .
and the last kind of innovation , invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call management innovation .
it gives you a sense of the trend .
in fact -- seriously .
this reminded me of clustering that we &apos;d seen also in infectious epidemics , for example cholera .
and this was a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself , first 50 or 60 days , then 90 days , and then there was unfortunately another shooting in another 90 days , and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon .
trauma centers and hospitals are doing their part in stepping up .
this short fiction piece by martin amis starts out , &quot; on september 11 , 2001 , he opened his eyes at 4 a.m. in portland , maine , and mohamed atta &apos;s last day began . &quot;
coincidence ? no , it &apos;s creepy .
by his own writing , this man was either asleep , at a prayer meeting with al and tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase .
and electric fields are not magnetism .
and we can observe this .
so these are patients who had received surgery , high dose radiation to the head and first-line chemotherapy , and that had failed and their tumors had grown back .
here you can see that a technician is placing them on there much like bandages .
you can see the tumor treating field field generator , but importantly you can also see that she is living her life .
clouds seldom visit this area .
it can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon .
because soon the water was not able to reach these areas .
these statues , marvelous statues , gives you an idea of water table .
now , you don &apos;t find any kund ; they are all submerged .
the last point , we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert .
with wisdom and wit , anupam mishra talks about the amazing feats of engineering built centuries ago by the people of india &apos;s golden desert to harvest water . these structures are still used today -- and are often superior to modern water megaprojects .
does anyone recognize this ? in fact , they do .
today , sub-sahara is at the levels that turkey and mexico were at in 1975 .
every poor country is corrupt .
and if i lay sub-saharan growth on top of the indian growth story , it &apos;s remarkably similar .
so that &apos;s why i &apos;ve always been fascinated with how technology could actually reshape and open up authoritarian societies like ours .
and , again , this is happening quite often .
you put it on the front page of your blog .
it &apos;s going to be pornography , &quot; sex and the city , &quot; or maybe watching funny videos of cats .
and he &apos;s five years old .
you only tell your dearest , closest friend , sworn to secrecy for life , the first time you had sex .
in fact , the american publishers of my book , &quot; the elephant , the tiger and the cell phone , &quot; added a gratuitous subtitle saying , &quot; india : the next 21st-century power . &quot;
i think you &apos;ve already heard the figures .
fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones .
and they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show &apos;s heroine , &quot; tulsi zindabad &quot; : &quot; long live tulsi . &quot;
you know , we just celebrated , this year , our general elections , the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history .
and the consensus is of a very simple principle , that in a diverse plural democracy like india you don &apos;t really have to agree on everything all the time , so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree .
so after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources i had , i went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . it &apos;s actually available on the market .
our body loves these . it eats them .
so you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don &apos;t like , like staphylococcus -- i don &apos;t like it in particular , because it killed a professor friend of mine last year .
this is sea-monkeys .
so this was pretty shocking to me , that we could do this .
now , it &apos;s post-9 / 11 america , and when you go into the research institute , and you say , &quot; hi .
we ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal .
we hope not , or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common .
there &apos;s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey .
this is the strange inversion .
alexandria , much older than egypt .
independents , on the whole , don &apos;t get elected to office .
or putin . or any national leader .
los angeles cleaned up its port , which was 40 percent of carbon emissions , and as a result got rid of about 20 percent of carbon .
if ever there were citizens without borders , i think it &apos;s the citizens of ted who show the promise to be those citizens without borders .
and this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking .
so this is a finger blaster , and you will find that every one of you has got one taped under your chair .
helps us do our jobs better , and helps us feel better when we do them .
did anybody to a variation on a theme ? like a smiley face ?
we don &apos;t know , but it may be .
now , david kelley calls this behavior , when it &apos;s carried out by designers , &quot; thinking with your hands . &quot;
they can be a little skeptical ; i &apos;ll come back to that .
he wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter .
because it &apos;s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute .
and reaching success , i always did what i loved .
in his typically candid style , richard st. john reminds us that success is not a one-way street , but a constant journey . he uses the story of his business &apos; rise and fall to illustrate a valuable lesson -- when we stop trying , we fail .
and i sent out this call to singers .
and i had the same reaction you did .
yeah , i &apos;m sure a lot of you have heard that too .
which means that what i consider moral or immoral based on that might not necessarily be what you consider moral or immoral .
in the words of michel foucault , &quot; it is a technology of the self . &quot;
but really it means excellence .
a good life -- a life that you say you as a designer consent to by saying , &quot; in the good life , goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair .
so my co-teacher , sebastian thrun , and i thought , there must be a better way .
most online classes , the videos are always available .
we &apos;re gathering thousands of interactions per student per class , billions of interactions altogether , and now we can start analyzing that , and when we learn from that , do experimentations , that &apos;s when the real revolution will come .
and so the first question that came to mind was , well , how fast does this limb move ?
and if any of you ever have a chance , backstage of the national museum of natural history is one of the world &apos;s best collections of preserved mantis shrimp . and what -- this is serious business for me .
and so i wired up what &apos;s called a load cell .
and when this happens , it can cause areas of very low pressure , which results in the water literally vaporizing .
and the second they get into that time point when they can &apos;t strike any more , they just signal . they wave their legs around .
but it &apos;s a question of perception , and if that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking , if that &apos;s what you think i mean when i say , &quot; this is an ocean planet stupidly called &apos; earth . &apos; &quot; if you think that that &apos;s the relative importance , two to one , you &apos;re wrong by a factor of ten .
this planet has an inner atmosphere of water ; it &apos;s its inner atmosphere . it has two atmospheres -- a lesser , outer gaseous atmosphere , a lighter one .
and this ballet is controlled by this lady here .
it was the fact she was going so slow .
quads have been around for a long time .
once we have a model of the combined quad-pole system , we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it .
we can &apos;t help but hold our breath when we watch a diver somersaulting into the water , or when a vaulter is twisting in the air , the ground fast approaching .
what happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being ?
let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain .
i just wanted a richer and rawer life than i &apos;ve been able to lead in britain , or , indeed , that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world .
the wolves changed the behavior of the rivers .
it has no view as to what a right ecosystem or a right assemblage of species looks like .
they are elephant-adapted .
so when i also think about design , i think about trying to rework and re-engage the lines on this graph in a more productive way .
so the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way , i think .
the concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on .
they were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an elizabethan public infrastructure .
and they had already started building the sewers in london , and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water .
and when i met him , he was a kind gentle old man .
so this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons .
and he brought a soccer ball , and we had soccer every night in this little village .
we have the website , where the kids all get their homepage .
and so the question is : how did that material get here ?
if you look at andromeda , which is the nearest big galaxy , and it &apos;s two million years ago .
so let me show you some of nature &apos;s patterns that are the result of this .
that is , we have to seriously play god , not just change people &apos;s lives , but make the universe , right .
it &apos;s got dark matter , it &apos;s got ordinary matter , it &apos;s got photons and it &apos;s got neutrinos , which don &apos;t play much role in the later part of the universe .
this simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
george smoot : the design of the universe
in three weeks , maybe three and a half , i had 46,000 signatures on this petition .
and you can make that change .
every time i sort of pushed one down , another one would just sort of pop back up again .
but we also need to know how to approach it in the right way to get the best from it .
all you need to do is to take 10 minutes out a day to step back , to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus , calm and clarity in your life .
at the time , i was finishing up school , and i was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies .
or what if instead of making art to display , i had to destroy it ?
now , when i run into a barrier or i find myself creatively stumped , i sometimes still struggle , but i continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities , like using hundreds of real , live worms to make an image , using a pushpin to tattoo a banana , or painting a picture with hamburger grease .
now why would they return to such deadly soil ?
the benefits of hardy , physical living , but an environment made toxic by a complicated , little-understood enemy , radiation .
thank you .
is that our little devices , those little devices in our pockets , are so psychologically powerful that they don &apos;t only change what we do , they change who we are .
but then he stops himself and he says , &quot; you know , i &apos;m not telling you the truth .
over and over i hear , &quot; i would rather text than talk . &quot;
we &apos;re lonely , but we &apos;re afraid of intimacy .
but in the process , we set ourselves up to be isolated .
change that .
and i did know how the alumni of various schools back in the 30s judged coaches and athletic teams .
and about the same time i ran across this one verse , i ran across another one . someone asked a lady teacher why she taught .
i believe in time -- very important .
i believe that we must believe , truly believe . not just give it word service ; believe that things will work out as they should , providing we do what we should .
never mention winning . my idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game .
i mention in my book , &quot; they call me coach . &quot;
it &apos;s titled &quot; the culture of organs . &quot;
these are stem cells that we create from specific sources , and we can drive them to become heart cells , and they start beating in culture .
this is how it actually works .
so luke , before last night , when &apos;s the last time you saw tony ?
but let &apos;s face it , when you &apos;ve watched it once maybe , or twice , you don &apos;t really want to watch it again , because you know how jack bauer is going to defeat the terrorists .
i call this &quot; groundswell collaborative consumption . &quot;
a torrent of peer-to-peer social networks and real-time technologies , fundamentally changing the way we behave .
because what you need is the hole , not the drill .
in other words , i don &apos;t want stuff ; i want the needs or experiences it fulfills .
my name is joseph , a member of parliament in kenya .
the man on top can see , the blind man can walk .
after an ef3 tornado ripped straight through our town and took parts of our roof off , i decided to stay in massachusetts instead of pursuing the master &apos;s program i had moved my boxes home that afternoon for .
co : that was a tornado , and everyone &apos;s heading to the church to drop things off and volunteer .
mo : we didn &apos;t get our authority from the board of selectmen or the emergency management director or the united way .
this is the curve for joplin .
imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place before a disaster .
now , why do i say that ?
they called their landlord a wabenzi , meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a mercedes-benz .
he &apos;s got a fence ; he scavenged a door ; he &apos;s got new tile on the roof .
this here , on the right-hand side , is what &apos;s called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- it &apos;s a hotel .
the woman in the center is geeta jiwa .
the condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia , and it &apos;s now very rare in the developed world .
mrs. lois doery , whom i later came to call my surrogate mum , read me many thousands of hours onto tape .
for example , i was too shy then , and i &apos;m actually too shy now , to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material .
but i wouldn &apos;t give up the technology , because it &apos;s allowed me to lead a great life .
the technology will advance even further , but i can still remember my mum saying , 60 years ago , &quot; remember , darling , you &apos;ll never be able to read the print with your fingers . &quot;
and of course , when it comes to cognitive effects , &quot; use it or lose it &quot; applies , so you want to stay mentally stimulated .
the first is , technological progress is what allows us to continue this amazing recent run that we &apos;re on where output goes up over time , while at the same time , prices go down , and volume and quality just continue to explode .
but the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now .
so i cannot tell a happy story about these social trends , and they don &apos;t show any signs of reversing themselves .
so the green shoots are out there .
i had no mental acuity to speak of during the day , but i had flexible hours .
it used to be a weight room , so there were rubber floors below , acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights .
so that was the basis of it , was one-on-one attention .
then we said , &quot; well , what are we going to do with the space during the day , because it has to be used before 2 : 30 p.m. ? &quot;
and this became an ongoing thing . more and more books .
personally , i think it &apos;s a problem .
there &apos;s four family members that come in every day .
for most of that time , i &apos;ve been struggling and grappling with questions about the nature of god . who is god ?
and if this is true , it must also be that god knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit , as well .
either god is responsible for the tsunami , or god is not in control .
is god intimately involved in our suffering , so that he feels it in his own being ?
isn &apos;t it ironic that christians who claim to believe in an infinite , unknowable being then tie god down in closed systems and rigid doctrines ?
so , technology was sort of absent from everybody &apos;s thinking until 1952 , which happened to be the year of my birth .
how much learning can you do ?
so , humanity is our greatest invention .
so , i would like to say that while there is six kingdoms of life , we can think of technology basically as a seventh kingdom of life .
nuclear energy , fission , is really bad idea for bombs .
everything in my room was shaking -- my heart , my windows , my bed , everything .
it &apos;s like dying from inside-out .
we are missing the stories of violet , who , despite surviving genocide in the church massacre , she kept on going on , burying bodies , cleaning homes , cleaning the streets .
she was sending them to school . have a new home .
what is our mission ? what do we have to do ? i think our mission is to reconcile , to reintegrate science and the arts , because right now there &apos;s a schism that exists in popular culture . you know , people have this idea that science and the arts are really separate .
each one of them are different manifestations , incarnations , of creativity , avatars of human creativity , and that &apos;s what we have to reconcile in our minds , how these things fit together .
so people might say , well , i still like that intuitive versus analytical thing , because everybody wants to do the right brain , left brain thing , right ?
we got a bunch of scientists in all stages of their careers . they came to dartmouth college , where i was teaching , and they talked about with theologians and financiers , what are some of the issues of public funding for science and engineering research ? what &apos;s most important about it ?
michael moschen spoke of having to teach and learn how to feel with my eyes , to see with my hands .
you know , there &apos;s also something called the &quot; complete idiot &apos;s guide ? &quot;
i mean that simplicity sky .
wasn &apos;t she amazing ? muriel cooper . she was wacky .
and i &apos;ve always felt bad about it , in a sense .
but i thought , &quot; this is very interesting . what if i make like a car crash test ? &quot;
so , i thought , maybe i &apos;ll do this for the next twenty years or something .
like everything you see , every time you wake up .
as mahatma gandhi famously said , &quot; you must become the change you wish to see in the world . &quot;
the extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much . it comes back in the winter , but not as permanent ice , as thin ice -- vulnerable . the amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years .
if the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture , we would still have this crisis .
we now have a culture of distraction .
connect with people . become very active as citizens .
you work over different time zones , you talk to very different people , you multitask . we all know it , and we do it kind of automatically .
new sensing elements on the body -- you can grow hairs on your nails , and therefore grab some of the particles from another person .
and here &apos;s the whole code of pac-man , visualized with all the go-to , go-back-to , also made into a beautiful choreography .
and then you can send it to the kinko &apos;s store at the corner and go get your chair . now , the implications of this are enormous , not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process , but also no tracking , no warehousing , no wasted materials .
you need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something .
we look around the media , as we see on the news from iraq , afghanistan , sierra leone , and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us .
you take all of the conflict , all of the chaos , all of the noise , and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict .
so we look at a process of group dynamics : coalescence and fragmentation , groups coming together , groups breaking apart .
and it stays there through the invasion of fallujah until the samarra bombings in the iraqi elections of &apos; 06 .
and all the main religions have similar teachings .
we actually have to do something about it .
and he rushed home . and after the sabbath , he made 12 loaves of bread , took them to the synagogue , went into the synagogue , opened the ark and said , &quot; god , i don &apos;t know why you want this bread , but here you are . &quot;
and the poor man said , &quot; and you mean god didn &apos;t answer my pleas ? &quot;
in fact , imagine something even worse .
these cells , called glial cells , were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together , like the nerves .
a chunk of rock six miles across , moving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet , slammed into the earth .
but it won &apos;t wipe out , you know , all life on earth , so that &apos;s fine . but it turns out , you don &apos;t need something six miles across to do a lot of damage .
it &apos;s right here .
comets are very much like asteroids .
the gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe , and the probe has a couple of tons of mass .
an event seen from one point of view gives one impression .
and you have a problem making ends meet .
so i thought that that &apos;s actually my problem .
you collect interest and do nothing in between .
and i could spend hours talking about them , because they &apos;re all kind of heroes .
that is not too much , is it ?
once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix .
we may not even be terribly far from it .
symmetry is very important in this discussion .
four sources told it . that when they had the plague in cambridge , and he went down to his mother &apos;s farm -- because the university was closed -- he saw an apple fall from a tree , or on his head or something .
he had a huge ambition .
for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé .
but it was too late .
but luckily , my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest !
&quot; the writing on the wall &quot; is part of our everyday language .
and by the time of his son darius , the whole of the eastern mediterranean is under persian control .
we only knew about the return of the jews and the decree of cyrus from the hebrew scriptures .
40 years on and we &apos;re in 1917 , and the cylinder enters a different world .
is iran still to be the defender of the oppressed ?
this forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical , social , language , cognitive and psychomotor development .
there &apos;s rarely enough to eat . they are often hungry .
i couldn &apos;t understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people .
so he was like my hero .
so mary robinson , she said to me , &quot; listen , this is an idea whose time has come . this must be created . &quot;
and suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day .
because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there &apos;d be more -- when we got into certain areas , maybe there would be more people interested .
and that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn &apos;t be kidnapped or killed .
why don &apos;t you support the process of the largest ever global truce ?
here &apos;s a crazy idea : persuade the world to try living in peace for just one day , every september 21 . in this energetic , honest talk , jeremy gilley tells the story of how this crazy idea became real -- real enough to help millions of kids in war-torn regions .
our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain .
because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically , we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain .
we calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods , and on the other hand , how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs , and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day .
my answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex , and i think that &apos;s the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
i set up my studio in the red-light district and obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing , and found a way to redefine the skin and create this dynamic textile .
for many years , we were just providing them with artificial limbs .
the cars disappeared as well .
give him some money . &quot;
and najmuddin was staying there , doing everything and reporting on the patients .
and mahmoud , &quot; of course i can .
i feel ashamed .
i can &apos;t believe it . &quot;
and when you start changing , you cannot stop .
and you should see me during the match .
and that hospital could have afforded flashlights .
and so i started to argue with these men .
and i realized just what had happened to me at swarthmore , this transformation -- the ability to confront problems , complex problems , and to design solutions to those problems .
this is wrong .
can we create a perfect society ?
it &apos;s an incredible opportunity .
that &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human eyes .
no , i don &apos;t do that ; i &apos;m a conjurer , who is someone who pretends to be a real magician .
thirty-two tablets of calms forte .
we paid a lot of money for that information , be we didn &apos;t get it .
now , folks often ask us at the james randi educational foundation , they call me , they say , &quot; why are you so concerned about this , mr. randi ?
duh .
they need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce .
he forgot to take his pill .
i &apos;m willing to take your suggestions , and i &apos;m willing to have you tune in to our webpage .
it needs a hospital whose budget can allow it to support one machine costing upwards of 50 or $ 100,000 .
and what &apos;s so frustrating is this is not a singular event ; this happens across the developing world .
everything else is the same .
so to do that we &apos;ve launched a number of partnerships with ngos and universities to gather data on the user interface , on the types of surgeries it &apos;s appropriate for and ways we can enhance the device itself .
the different types of writing in africa , first was proto-writing , as illustrated by nsibidi , which is the writing system of a secret society of the ejagham people in southern nigeria .
most probably , one of humanity &apos;s greatest achievements is the invention of the alphabet , and that has been attributed to mesopotamia with their invention of cuneiform in 1600 bc , followed by hieroglyphics in egypt , and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact .
now , you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts , but methane is 20 times more poisonous than co2 , and it &apos;s not just methane .
three : their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and earth-friendly diet .
seriously .
there was no marketing . there were no national brands .
many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad .
my mom is not here , so i can say this now .
so , now we clamor for organic food .
what do you think we eat per day ? half a pound .
mark bittman : what &apos;s wrong with what we eat
if you want to take it to the next level , remember , the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats .
so you can take a picture with an iphone and get all the names , although , again , sometimes it does make mistakes .
how did hippomenes beat her ?
once you think about it , you see this is not statistical points ; these are -- let &apos;s see , how far have i talked ?
everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees .
if we want to achieve this , what , in the world , would have to change ?
modalities and special faculties .
down here in this little corner , here , we have the little sub-space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings -- beings with our biological capacities .
jh : because if the power went out , there would just be a big noise .
jh : thanks guys .
like this green one , this is a painting i did about 10 years ago , but it has some -- see , in the upper third -- there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery .
in my case , my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also .
there were no visitors allowed , so my mother bribed a hospital worker .
and we were shocked .
and my dad is the most voracious reader i know .
so i thought , a biennial needs artists .
and so you &apos;re standing there and everything else is dark , but there &apos;s this portal that you want to jump in .
and what he does is -- he spends a week at a time with a family .
so hopefully what happens is you never use it , and it &apos;s an heirloom that you pass down .
but it &apos;s actually a painting .
next is by a lithuanian fortune teller , jurgi petrauskas .
my talk is &quot; flapping birds and space telescopes . &quot;
the first law is two-colorability . you can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting .
there are other dimensions for flaps .
and if you say , &quot; well , but the guitar , bass -- that &apos;s not so hot .
and it works perfectly on its test range , and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle .
fn : and i also had an interest in dangerous inventions .
and they &apos;re starting to dominate lots of professions -- doctors , lawyers , bankers , accountants .
and look at that last headline -- young women earning more than young men .
and those are all things that women do very well .
hanna rosin : and why is that ?
now they &apos;ve been asking a question since 1985 : &quot; how strongly do you prefer a first-born son ? &quot;
thanks very much .
so yeah , this task does seem to be daunting .
so steve , how about let &apos;s zap the brain with electricity ?
do i sit here and pretend like i don &apos;t exist ? &quot;
and then we published our findings in the journal nature .
again , we had just reactivated the memory of the blue box while the animal got a couple of mild foot shocks , and now the animal suddenly freezes .
instead of talking about little green men , he talked about how the psyche of the europeans had been traumatized by the war , and now they &apos;re projecting flying saucers into the sky .
but actually , our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second .
it &apos;s kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you &apos;re working .
unfortunately , a lot of people &apos;s experience is in apathy .
means &quot; which place goes deepest inside you and where do you try to spend most of your time ? &quot;
the real voyage of discovery , as marcel proust famously said , consists not in seeing new sights , but in looking with new eyes .
but my friend assured me that he wasn &apos;t catholic , nor were most of his students , but he took his classes there every spring .
thank you .
leah buechley : how to &quot; sketch &quot; with electronics
and the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them .
every bubble is a country . the size is population .
well , i &apos;m not an optimist , neither am i a pessimist .
within britain , there is a gradient of health -- and this is what &apos;s called standardized mortality , basically your chances of dying .
and they were the first people to describe this new chemical transmitter , nitric oxide .
so these are kind of sunlamps .
so we thought we &apos;d just kind of model -- different amounts of uv hit different parts of the earth at different times of year , so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide -- the nitrates , nitrites , nitrosothiols in the skin -- cleave to release no .
yes , sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer , but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher than deaths from skin cancer .
if you teach a man to fish , you feed him for a lifetime . &quot;
we fast-track . we figure out the game .
my dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale .
remember at 10 years old -- so 34 years ago i saw opportunity in this stuff .
i would carry their golf bags up to the top , and they &apos;d pay me a dollar .
it had our university logo on it .
don &apos;t read them bedtime stories every night .
these guys , grasshopper .
it &apos;s not really that foreign of a concept , actually ; it happens on the earth every day .
and then , six months later on the right-hand side you see this reengineered urethra .
and what we do is we , to make a blood vessel , same strategy .
it &apos;s true .
another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs .
why ? because they will not reject .
but actually method a is the correct approach .
since education under the soviet union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology , they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women .
meanwhile , the values and voices of democracy are silent .
so the conversation began at bennington .
social activists , business leaders , lawyers , politicians , professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good .
president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
and ... wikipedia is fixed , finally .
so here &apos;s exhibit number one .
ll : and so then , what this libertarian draws from these two points ...
now , when we tried to challenge this , going to the supreme court , getting the supreme court , the bunch of conservatives there -- if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down , we had the assistance of nobel prize winners including this right-wing nobel prize winner , milton friedman , who said he would join our brief only if the word &quot; no brainer &quot; was in the brief somewhere .
and it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that &apos;s obviously developed around these licenses , as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there , licensed freely in this way .
now , that was the story of me then , my good old days of right-wing lunacy .
and some opt out thinking of themselves as creative at that point .
in fact , everything was better than fine .
he was saving lives with this machine .
i thought a lot about , what was i put on earth to do ?
so , for example , when you touch a pencil , microbial exchange happens .
if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another , they have very similar ecosystems , but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away , the ecosystem is fundamentally different .
wouldn &apos;t it be awesome if we all had blis on our phones ?
and he had a platform where you linked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
and our pc version became quite mature .
and according to fortune magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
in fact , someone on reddit thought , &quot; oh , what a great thing , we should all vote this up . &quot;
they even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing splashy .
from gando , my home village in burkina faso , to berlin in germany to become an architect is a big , big step .
and for me and my community , this project was a huge success .
they will do it themselves .
i just asked my mother one day , &quot; why do all these women love me so much ? &quot;
winter is like magic . it &apos;s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
24 / 7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force .
first of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
you can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
so actually the response of china to the question of hong kong -- as it will be to the question of taiwan -- was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
it &apos;s had no serious rivals .
it &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
and at last , i &apos;m afraid -- take europe ; america is slightly different -- but europeans by and large , i have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
musician and inventor onyx ashanti demonstrates &quot; beatjazz &quot; -- his music created with two handheld controllers , an iphone and a mouthpiece , and played with the entire body . at ted &apos;s full spectrum auditions , after locking in his beats and loops , he plays a 3-minute song that shares his vision for the future of music .
and i framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising .
a year later , the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of paris .
so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born .
when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents , i couldn &apos;t always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict .
i &apos;m not interested in filming the violence and the weapons .
or they tell you , &quot; are these people all dead ? &quot;
i heard culturally and because of the law , they would just arrest us at the first pasting .
a really important point for me is that i don &apos;t use any brand or corporate sponsors .
art can change the way we see the world .
and it &apos;s starting to look at -- not always and not for everything -- but in certain moments of time , access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them .
they made it aspirational .
whipcar , which started april of last year , it took them six months to get 1,000 cars in the service .
the areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement .
the future , as we know it , is very unpredictable .
that &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
the most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in china and in many other countries .
ian goldin : navigating our global future
and he was very impressed . he was all tearing up . ready to hug me .
the next slide i &apos;m about to show you , is a little more serious .
it was so exciting .
i was in india , and i was walking down the streets , and i saw a billboard painter .
she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work .
i could not live this larger than life person .
how can a family get dysfunctional ?
i whipped out my pen , and i started drawing on her head and i drew a crown for her .
sw : yeah . she especially likes his latest achievement , spaceshipone .
you like to drink water .
why do we want to protect your home ?
and went from swimming one lap -- so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey , at about 200 beats per minute heart rate -- i measured it -- to going to montauk on long island , close to where i grew up , and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water , getting out and feeling better than when i went in .
and you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position .
i suffered through spanish for junior high , first year of high school , and the sum total of my knowledge was pretty much , &quot; donde esta el bano ? &quot;
and that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method .
not very good for ballroom dancing .
long steps . so a lot of milongueros -- the tango dancers will use very short steps .
so using my arch-nemesis , spanish , no less , to learn tango .
and we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the renaissance where work and learning are integrated .
other ones have a focus on health care , tourism , engineering and other fields .
and he &apos;s so terrifying that none of the israelite soldiers want to fight him .
there &apos;s heavy infantry , which are foot soldiers , armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor .
that &apos;s where his strength lies .
famous . he had acromegaly .
you see , diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself , and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin .
i gave a talk , and a family friend who happened to be the dean of georgetown medical school was at the talk , and came up to me afterwards saying , they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people .
premature infants have real problems with their microbial community .
but we can see them through their dna , we can see them through the effects that they have on people .
a lot of people think in a very english-centric way on the internet , but for us , we &apos;re truly global . we &apos;re in many , many languages .
so when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me , you think , oh , this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish .
so we have very diverse contributors in terms of political , religious , cultural backgrounds .
another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended .
i always laugh at this , because i have no idea how they &apos;re elected , actually .
ben saunders : yeah , hi , ben saunders .
his name was jasaw chan k &apos;awiil .
goodbye , my love , goodbye . &quot;
that brain system -- the reward system for wanting , for motivation , for craving , for focus -- becomes more active when you can &apos;t get what you want .
and indeed , there are now three academic articles in which they &apos;ve looked at this attraction , which may only last for a second , but it &apos;s a definite attraction , and either this same brain region , this reward system , or the chemicals of that reward system are involved .
faulkner once said , &quot; the past is not dead , it &apos;s not even the past . &quot;
in order to raise the historical awareness of this fact , the government has planted mulberry trees .
thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention .
in my current role , i see up close how technology is beginning to transform industrial sectors that play a huge role in our economy and in our lives : energy , aviation , transportation , health care .
just in the u.s. , a system like this can prevent over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year , helping seven million passengers get to their destinations on time .
and innovation is disruptive .
but this is not a foregone conclusion .
and the song is based on what i think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces .
and his equipment as well .
and you &apos;re not piloting ?
four little engines , 22 kilos thrust each , turbines working with kerosene .
so i was at my minimum altitude in that vector -- fast -- so i pulled that .
it &apos;s well said . it &apos;s well said .
yr : yes , with the final goal to take off , but with initial speed .
nuclei and nuclear reactions , of course .
authorities had been rejected before , many times .
some rocks and some finches .
and her mother , demeter , goddess of the earth , is sad , and makes it cold and barren .
that &apos;s a good explanation : hard to vary , because every detail plays a functional role .
i &apos;d like to start with a little experiment .
i started working on it in 1985 , and it &apos;s been evolving very slowly .
the sydney festival which produced &quot; minto : live &quot; i think represents a new kind of 21st-century arts festival .
so , the dialogue with the local and the global , the audience as participant and player and protagonist , the innovative use of site , all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic french company royal de luxe .
now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession , which is , never betray the illusion .
and i knew someday that i was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it .
and what does that mean ?
these ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice .
i got very nervous -- no rope , no safety line , the whole world is moving around me -- and i thought , &quot; i &apos;m in trouble . &quot;
oh , and they also happen to eat happy feet .
but he was right .
i was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding , because i was crying underwater , just because it was so amazing .
i get emotional . sorry .
so , without looking at your phone , what time was it ?
so if i could control how you spend your attention , if i could maybe steal your attention through a distraction .
good to see you , sir . you have a ring , a watch .
ar : would you be surprised if i could take it out of your hand ? say yes .
we &apos;re just shopping . this trick &apos;s more about the timing , really .
is this ? i have no idea . that &apos;s a shrimp .
the question is , which of these horizontal lines is longer ?
that &apos;s not the important point . the thing you have to remember is , these are eminent economists , some of the smartest people on the planet . do you see the challenge ?
they &apos;re called eddies . not me . and they &apos;re violently dispersing the ink so that it actually gets diluted out , and the color &apos;s gone .
eddie obeng : smart failure for a fast-changing world
you can see that here by the different reflection on this side .
they go to see michelangelo &apos;s &quot; david , &quot; and when they finally come face to face with the statue , they both freeze dead in their tracks .
ok . this is a bit of a problem .
the first one is harm / care .
and how will it end up being different from a kid born 60 miles south of us in lynchburg , virginia ?
this effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question .
a game in which you give people money , and then , on each round of the game , they can put money into a common pot , and then the experimenter doubles what &apos;s in there , and then it &apos;s all divided among the players .
this is an absolute miracle , much harder to explain than the grand canyon .
think about yin and yang .
step out of the moral matrix , just try to see it as a struggle playing out , in which everybody does think they &apos;re right , and everybody , at least , has some reasons -- even if you disagree with them -- everybody has some reasons for what they &apos;re doing .
if we shoot someone who wasn &apos;t hostile , at least we haven &apos;t killed them . &quot;
we &apos;re looking at something different , &quot; and didn &apos;t seem to recognize , in fact , they were looking at pretty much the same stuff .
hundreds ? one , three .
so this was one particular problem they talked about , that it might be used indiscriminately .
but my personal favorite of these ones , i have to confess , does actually come from the united states : &quot; officers taser 86 year-old disabled woman in her bed . &quot;
we have this ability to make things , to grasp things with our hands .
i don &apos;t know if this is called a basket-bra , but it ought to be something like that .
makers and shapers and put-it-togetherers .
they &apos;re playing to discover what the technology can do , and probably to discover what they can do themselves , what their own capabilities are .
you could build your own satellite and get it into space for like 8,000 dollars .
well , it &apos;s certainly not this one .
and there &apos;s something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history . when the witches cast a magic spell on you , it was not in your self-interest -- it was to get you to act against your interest .
she is graceful , she is mysterious and she is transcendent , and those are the central qualities of glamour .
this sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period , but because , in it &apos;s streamlining , it transports us from the everyday .
this is what the real world of computers , lamps , electrical appliances of all kinds , looks like .
the white picket fence , the perfect house .
because what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re saying , your coat &apos;s not so glamorous , what &apos;s been edited out is something important .
sometimes under those hats there &apos;s a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow . &quot;
one night on stage , i actually entered my vagina .
in the middle of my traveling , i turned 40 and i began to hate my body , which was actually progress , because at least my body existed enough to hate it .
in his new and visionary book , &quot; new self , new world , &quot; the writer philip shepherd says , &quot; if you are divided from your body , you are also divided from the body of the world , which then appears to be other than you or separate from you , rather than the living continuum to which you belong . &quot;
and she sang -- i mean her whole body sang .
it was energy , love and joy .
and then finally , to show that some of the differences between people , in how we judge others , can be explained by differences in this brain system .
so , that one is his .
so first i &apos;m going to show you the three-year-old again .
and her friend drinks the coffee , and is fine .
so these are the judgments i showed you before , people &apos;s normal moral judgments .
and what we changed was not people &apos;s moral judgments when they &apos;re deciding what to do , when they &apos;re making action choices .
because that &apos;s kind of the world that we live in now , a world stuck in fast-forward .
now , if you think about how our world got so accelerated , the usual suspects rear their heads .
so they might curb traffic , or put in a park bench , or some green space .
but they lack spark ; they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside -- they don &apos;t know how to dream . and so what these ivy league schools , and oxford and cambridge and so on , are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit .
and i present myself as exhibit a , a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed-aholic .
carl honoré : in praise of slowness
the toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building : every beam in this building is the same radius , all laminated wood .
and the structures rise from the sand cliffs -- they &apos;re built in concrete and sandstones ; the roofs are stainless steel -- they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself , pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other .
the first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces -- spaces where research goes on , conference centers , a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking -- and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition , the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry .
it is really a sacred space .
we &apos;ll see what happens when we play with this palette .
if i really want the music to go there , the best way for me to do it is to listen .
my name is zamin .
you know , we fought hard to get at least a small pakistani contingent to come .
now , monsoon , the root of the word &quot; monsoon &quot; comes from the word &quot; season . &quot;
and then the adult , which comes after , lives for one or two months .
i didn &apos;t know at the time , but i know now , they &apos;re globe skimmers , hundreds of them .
maybe pulling bits off ? i &apos;m not asking about that .
it &apos;s pretty obvious , they &apos;re coming from india .
what on earth are they doing ?
the wind will swoosh them out across here .
a quite incredible feat .
it comes with the monsoons .
there was no opponent directly across from you .
and again , there &apos;s this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle that made me — oh , that one ?
and so the night before my surgery , i &apos;d watched , and i was like , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;
and these sub-movements are just kind of floating around , and as the wall hits you , they connect themselves to an extent , and that &apos;s when the cognitive mind , you think , &quot; oh , 360 flip , i &apos;m going to make that . &quot;
we have our edgier sides , too . it &apos;s funny , my dad was right .
rm : yeah . i , every time you think you &apos;ve chased something down , it &apos;s funny , no matter how good you are , and i know guys like this , it feels like you &apos;re polishing a turd .
now if you think about it , in the age before gps and radar , that was obviously a really difficult problem .
well it allowed you to do that .
and the chemical plant comprised 757 acres .
oh no , they were brilliantly accurate .
the air force &apos;s 1.5 billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb , which didn &apos;t need a bombsight at all .
why do we as people want to do that ?
and let me justify that with two statements .
thank you . john . that &apos;s great .
jh : questions for philip rosedale ? right here .
i mean , it &apos;s not often that you hear somebody describe themselves as really creative .
and so i just came , two days ago , from the himalayas to your kind invitation .
some people say , i only believed in remembering the past , imagining the future , never the present .
because we are speaking of a different level .
so now , if the inner conditions are stronger -- of course , the outer conditions do influence , and it &apos;s wonderful to live longer , healthier , to have access to information , education , to be able to travel , to have freedom . it &apos;s highly desirable .
mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors cannot happen at the same time .
mind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation .
in very short , people who have more activity in the right side of the prefrontal cortex are more depressed , withdrawn . they don &apos;t describe a lot of positive affect .
just this one example is worth a lot of work .
how long have we been divergent from each other ?
he categorized about 12,000 species in &quot; systema naturae . &quot;
imagine the longest book you can think of , &quot; war and peace . &quot;
well , we were going into the worst part of the last ice age .
well , you want the ultimate african success story ?
the majority going to something we call the legacy fund .
each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe .
but that &apos;s not completely true .
now , what are the ideal conditions for chemistry ?
and dna also copies itself .
the sad thing is , when they die , the information dies with them .
for a few days , the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction .
so we &apos;re probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking .
and what i &apos;m going to talk about today is save more tomorrow .
wonderful .
nobody checks boxes .
this is the notion of loss aversion .
maybe we should make people save more when they make more money .
we &apos;ve got a lot to do , a lot to solve , also in the retirement area when it comes to what people do with their money after retirement .
we are cultural test pilots , ladies and gentlemen .
please turn off your radio , eleanor .
the other said , &quot; how much did we hire him for ? &quot;
i &apos;m allowing myself to go into chaos because out of chaos , i &apos;m hoping some moments of truth will come .
you remember how india was . there was no pollution .
we are the stories we tell ourselves .
find the truth for yourself , and when you find the truth for yourself , there will be a truth in it , but it may contradict the plot , but don &apos;t worry about it . &quot;
bess : here , my lady .
bess : as you wish , majesty .
you understand flyovers ? yeah ?
harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution .
stories affirm who we are .
and that is all that love &apos;s about and we &apos;ll recall when time runs out that it only as : storytelling without dialogue .
and it &apos;s something that always drove all his choices .
but more importantly , have you made me want to know how it will all conclude in the long-term ?
off the bed .
boy : hey ! hey ! hey ! hey !
and he said i had a matching pair like that on my head , but i couldn &apos;t see them because of my hair .
what i found was , i started working with refugees and famine victims -- small farmers , all , or nearly all -- who had been dispossessed and displaced .
we needed to be working on lumber .
by 2050 , we &apos;re going to have nine billion people -- all the scientists agree .
they may have a lot of opinions about it , but they &apos;re not going to be terribly informed .
again , a daunting task .
eight entities came to the table .
it &apos;s a pre-competitive issue .
we &apos;re all on that same journey with them .
i was afraid to talk to my new boss , but decided to muster up my courage .
so imagine the little 200-gram rat attached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot , but the rat does not feel the robot .
they are the result of a young team of very talented people : physical therapists , neurobiologists , neurosurgeons , engineers of all kinds , who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals .
is based not only on the relationship between governments , but the common language and the values that we share , and i &apos;m reminded of that by watching you all today .
but barack reminded us on that day , all of us in that room , that we all know what our world should look like .
i liked being on time . i liked getting my work done .
and the breath , the breath is the captain of that vessel .
using the body -- it could be sneezing , it could be coughing , it could be animals -- exactly -- clapping , whatever .
and as you can tell , they are basically goof balls .
you need a lot of trust , but it &apos;s not like , &quot; i &apos;m trying to get to pensacola , please . &quot;
well , for a big clue , we turn to nanog .
but now , wikipedia doesn &apos;t just spontaneously work .
it was an act of kindness .
and it &apos;s no longer just a &quot; i don &apos;t know . i couldn &apos;t get there . i guess i &apos;ll move on , &quot; but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online .
feeling like the world is becoming less friendly ? social theorist jonathan zittrain begs to difffer . the internet , he suggests , is made up of millions of disinterested acts of kindness , curiosity and trust .
in red , sort of below oecd average .
you also see -- and i think that &apos;s one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries , and poor and badly-educated ones , a very , very important lesson .
people were stunned by the results .
and , of course , the question is , can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere ?
they watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling , and how they structure teacher pay .
but its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing .
but if you look , if you have that perspective , then you can see what happened in the last 60 years .
so naturally , i -- the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty .
but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area .
they had modems .
now , about that cow model i talked about .
and each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each .
1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the west .
actually if we go back into the historical record , there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in india and china was even above that of europe .
you can see that the health started to improve .
you see this enormous inequity in china , in the midst of fast economic growth .
and after second world war , united states is richer than u.k .
but they ain &apos;t going to pay for what others , who have more money , have largely created , and i can agree on that .
as you can imagine , even if you know physics , this should be intuitive , ok -- that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here , ok .
and that was that the gravitational field , due to mass , will deflect not only the trajectory of particles , but will deflect light itself .
and the answer is yes .
there is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen , ok .
they haven &apos;t seen anything , ok , but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are .
so you can imagine the scale of this problem .
and in comparison , a coca-cola is 10 times the price .
if you &apos;re an uninfected man living in botswana , where the hiv rate is 30 percent , if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner , girlfriend , mistress -- your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points .
and so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria .
unfortunately , there &apos;s almost no good data on hiv prevalence in the general population in africa until about 2003 .
so this is another way to see this .
but now i want to actually also question that .
that &apos;s where i live , and it &apos;s my university as well .
and we looked at it together .
it has no bacteria on its surface , no fouling on its surface , no barnacles .
it &apos;s self-assembling .
nanotechnology , nanoparticles , you hear a lot of worry about this .
mit just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips .
and hopefully , any inventor , anywhere in the world , will be able , in the moment of creation , to type in , &quot; how does nature remove salt from water ? &quot;
and they &apos;d say , &quot; well , because they want to survive . &quot;
we were four girls and no boys .
this was the first time a prime minister of india was given a parking ticket .
nine to eleven , every prisoner went into the education program -- the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
but then i started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
but since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
so this actually has given rise to a really big internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called captcha art .
okay , that &apos;s severin hacker .
okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
so the way this works is whenever you &apos;re a just a beginner , we give you very , very simple sentences .
now the thing that i &apos;m most excited about with duolingo is i think this provides a fair business model for language education .
that &apos;s peer-to-peer .
it just celebrated its seventh anniversary , and after seven years , last year it delivered 530 million dollars &apos; worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects .
all the drivers are becoming members . it &apos;s excellent .
all we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation -- nontrivial .
it certainly seems that we &apos;re going about our lives , that what we &apos;re doing , who we &apos;re with , what we &apos;re thinking about , have a big influence on our happiness , and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult , in fact almost impossible , for scientists to study .
nope . as it turns out , people are less happy when they &apos;re mind-wandering no matter what they &apos;re doing . for example , people don &apos;t really like commuting to work very much .
matt killingsworth : want to be happier ? stay in the moment
i mean , nor had ghana , even though we had been trying very hard .
a democracy could be upheld peacefully .
they usually talk about the 17th century .
he said -- he called what he &apos;d done as making -- they didn &apos;t call it a vacuum pump at the time .
so they were -- the really important part of this was , you were not supposed to talk about final causes , for instance .
in fact , everybody in this room probably , especially if you picked up your bag -- some of you , i know , didn &apos;t pick up your bags -- but if you picked up your bag , everybody in this room has got in their pocket , or back in their room , something that 350 years ago , kings would have gone to war to have .
and then i tried the melting business , and i melted it .
ok . all scientists aren &apos;t like that .
well , these guys measured all of those things .
but that &apos;s not what i want to talk to you about , because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells that are completely changing the way we look and model disease , our ability to understand why we get sick , and even develop drugs .
you can &apos;t imagine other businesses that you would think of going into that have these kind of numbers .
it &apos;s like having an app without having a smartphone .
one day , in the subway , i was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two , and a man came up to me and said , &quot; you can &apos;t take photographs here .
this is a tunnel underneath riverside park .
this children &apos;s hospital was closed in 1997 ; it &apos;s located in newark .
this is the tower of saint jacques .
and they &apos;re questions that i &apos;ve asked of science television producers , of audiences of science educators -- so that &apos;s science teachers -- and also of seven-year-olds , and i find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better than the other audiences , which is somewhat surprising .
and , for any finnish people in the audience , this is a finnish pun : we are , both literally and metaphorically , skating on thin ice if we don &apos;t understand that kind of thing .
so , as &quot; monty python &quot; would have it , this is a bit lord privy seal to say so , but this is -- children are not empty vessels .
before we do that , i want to kind of put biology in its place .
you can see there &apos;s architecture growing , filling the void .
well , i like think of it as a flame in a bottle .
but life begins , what does that mean ?
but we need to make some containers .
but not only just that , we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology .
lc : hopefully within the next two years .
but first thing , when you see dots like this , you have to ask yourself : from where do the data come ?
they say , &quot; 0.9 percent , no progress . &quot;
still here , child death per 1,000 on that axis .
and sweden never reached &#91; the &#93; millennium development goal rate , 3.1 percent when i calculated .
it got down there -- china comes into the western box here .
and that is fully possible . let &apos;s do it .
let me confirm what she said .
stretch the envelope . &quot;
and what happened was that -- more from less -- you can see how much more for how much less .
and if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe , you &apos;re talking about 10,000 days of income .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
and you can see this indian psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of &#91; unclear &#93; by doing things differently .
and there &apos;s a 25-dollar incubator giving that performance that had been created .
and then the paper burned .
my first app was a unique fortune teller called earth fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was .
thomas suarez : a 12-year-old app developer
and then that &apos;s a heat exchanger to what makes this design really , really interesting , and that &apos;s a heat exchanger to a gas .
the fuel , like i said , is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors , fukushima and three mile island -- looking back at three mile island , we didn &apos;t really see this for a while — but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , steam , in an oxidizing environment , they &apos;ll actually produce hydrogen , and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products .
i think that i &apos;ve designed this reactor here that can be an innovative source of energy , provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications , and i &apos;m really prepared to do this .
the experience capital in the world of conferences .
are you rendering authenticity ?
disney world , on the other hand , is a fake real , or a fake reality .
let me summarize it , for the business people in the audience , with three rules , three basic rules .
if the fetus continues to grow at this speed for the entire nine months , it would be 1.5 tons at birth .
we &apos;re actually doing the launch of two new studies of actually scanning babies &apos; brains from the moment they &apos;re born .
and i started to make him walk across the table , and i thought , &quot; oh , i can make a little machine that will do that . &quot;
but i had a lot of fun .
because i &apos;ve noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars .
now , what we can do with the spectra ?
my colleagues , comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars , actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy .
we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun-like stars .
the slope which is coming , which we call a red edge , is a detection of vegetated area .
i think it will come from a spectrum like this .
why don &apos;t you just say i &apos;m a researcher-storyteller . &quot;
when you ask people about belonging , they &apos;ll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded .
there was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it .
they talked about the willingness to say , &quot; i love you &quot; first , the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees , the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram .
and so i said , &quot; here &apos;s the thing , i &apos;m struggling . &quot;
no .
the other thing we do is we make everything that &apos;s uncertain certain .
we pretend that what we do doesn &apos;t have an effect on people .
they were making detailed journals of their spending , their mood , their symptoms , their treatments .
what is this for ?
it also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission , to tell the drone where to go .
we &apos;ve also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in gabon , elephants , and even turtle nests .
but the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images , and that takes a lot of time , especially if there are dozens or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest .
to us , it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool , including drones , in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet .
here he is in the pool . but here he is healthy , as a builder : taller , stronger , got all the women , amazing guy .
these are patients currently on drugs , sharing data .
you can look at the interaction between how i treat my als .
this is a report about a drug called lithium .
can we find out what &apos;s going to happen to you , so that you can maybe change it ? &quot;
those little lines ? that &apos;s the power .
i &apos;ve got to thank the 45,000 people that are doing this social experiment with us .
in winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
it &apos;s a film that you can look through .
these also require tremendous amounts of energy .
but this is different .
this means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions , so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions .
and it has implications for systemic risk .
it &apos;s actually not that hard to understand .
reality is so complex , we need to move away from dogma .
i got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke .
now we have the best data on honeybees , so i &apos;ll use them as an example .
how much is it going to take to contaminate humans ?
set aside farmland .
honeybees have thrived for 50 million years , each colony 40 to 50,000 individuals coordinated in amazing harmony . so why , seven years ago , did colonies start dying en masse ? marla spivak reveals four reasons which are interacting with tragic consequences . this is not simply a problem because bees pollinate a third of the world &apos;s crops . could this incredible species be holding up a mirror for us ?
and then you need smartly designed interactions .
we also worked with autodesk on a software they &apos;re developing called project cyborg .
i was two years older than my sister at the time -- i mean , i &apos;m two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that i wanted to do , and i wanted to play war .
and we know that &apos;s a measurement error because it &apos;s messing up my data .
bobo called me on the phone from yale medical school , and bobo said , &quot; shawn , i have leprosy . &quot;
so every year , instead of just teaching our students , we also have a wellness week .
your intelligence rises , your creativity rises , your energy levels rise .
o.k. , so , everyone has a computer .
and because working in a store was so hard , i liked going to school ; it was like heaven .
and when my professors saw this , they were very upset at me .
and it &apos;s a sort of a working computer . and when i built this computer , i had a moment of -- what is it called ? -- the epiphany where i realized that the computer &apos;s just so fast .
we &apos;re so used to working in one vector .
so anyways , there are all these things you can do , but the thing i love the most is to experience , taste the world .
risd is kind of my new kind of passion , and i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about that .
and by the way , all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black , if you happen to be poor , if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school .
i don &apos;t want to write that stuff . &quot;
we have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there .
we need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can , trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them .
it was a historical day .
but don &apos;t expect me to actually perform the trick in front of your eyes , because the probability for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small .
in about five billion years , our sun will become a red giant , as large as the earth &apos;s orbit , and our earth will be kaput , and in a thousand billion years , if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate , you will not even be able to see as far as your toes , because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light .
but whichever it turns out to be , there is one thing i &apos;m sure of : the journey will be full of surprises .
so we made it very small , so things were about 30 nanometers in size ; making it very cold , so at liquid helium temperatures ; and changing environment by changing the voltage , and the electrons could make flow around a loop one at a time , on and off , a little memory node .
and we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better .
but it &apos;s not about the technology .
so if you do choose to interact with the piece , and you press the blender button , it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment .
you take off and land at a local airport .
that &apos;s real time .
now , bad weather comes in , just land , fold up the wings , drive home .
and one of the things that you realize is it &apos;s an unusual environment .
the bars protect us . that &apos;s sort of fun , right ?
what is new yorker humor ?
in here , you have the propriety of the new yorker and the vulgarity of the language .
office worker : falafel ? bm : let me look at it .
and so , this benign , that &apos;s true of &quot; no , thursday &apos;s out . how about never — is never good for you ? &quot;
that &apos;s a cartoon about terrorism .
humor does need a target .
the other thing the new yorker plays around with is incongruity , and incongruity , i &apos;ve shown you , is sort of the basis of humor .
and they came up with a very good engineering solution , which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from london to the coast , and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time .
and also , 18th century prussians ate very , very few vegetables -- rather like contemporary scottish people .
but the first thing is that all value is subjective .
now , that is , actually , when you think about it -- we take it for granted -- it &apos;s actually a remarkable achievement , to produce something that &apos;s that democratic .
but so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people , for giving them better information -- b.j. fogg , at the university of stanford , makes the point that actually the mobile phone is -- he &apos;s invented the phrase , &quot; persuasive technologies . &quot;
so , shreddies is actually producing a new product , which is something very exciting for them .
the second one is the second g.k. chesterton quote of this session , which is , &quot; we are perishing for want of wonder , not for want of wonders , &quot; which i think for anybody involved in technology , is perfectly true .
i felt i was not alive anymore .
it &apos;s all just the same thing happening .
we &apos;re so used to thinking in terms of biology , we think about genes this way .
i wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself , or copied it from someone else ?
it gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human , all conventional theories of cultural evolution , of the origin of humans , and what makes us so different from other species .
and we &apos;re getting there .
because every step is dangerous .
louise leakey talked yesterday about how we &apos;re the only one in this branch left .
so , those are the two possibilities .
this is the largest metropolitan-area disaster in decades , and it was not a natural disaster -- it was a disaster of engineering .
he took his boss aside , and he showed him the materials on confined masonry .
now i &apos;m sure as everyone in the audience already knows -- i did have to explain it to my nine-year-old late last week -- penises are structures that transfer sperm from one individual to another .
without both elements you have no support .
now my adviser &apos;s concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton .
not just about its genetics and molecular biology , but up here in the meat end of the scale .
i kept on doing this for a while .
you would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases , people would cheat more , but in fact it wasn &apos;t the case .
and i came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators ?
and the experimenter said , &quot; if you &apos;ve finished everything , go home .
the question is , are we going to test those intuitions ?
so a more challenging question is one that i was asked , actually , by one of our writers a couple of weeks ago , and i didn &apos;t know the answer : what &apos;s the world &apos;s best performing currency ?
there &apos;s a p.r. company called edelman , they do this very interesting survey every year precisely around trust and what people are thinking .
it could become a natural extension , that as well as buying stuff -- take it out of the kindle -- you could buy books , music , real-life products , appliances and goods and so on .
people are used to , because mobile is king , they &apos;re very , very used to transferring money , making payments via mobile .
natalie macmaster : i &apos;m going to just quickly start out with a little bit of music here .
i have a tape of yours at home . &quot;
dl : how fast ?
okay .
as you can see from the pictures , both noam and i had an early fascination with first principles , and over the years , as our knowledge of science and technology became more sophisticated , this early awe with the basics has only intensified .
they want to figure out how things work , and they want to do it in groups , like this hackers club in washington , d.c. , that uses our materials to offer community courses .
so for example , let &apos;s take area .
shimon schocken : the self-organizing computer course
the congo consistently scores dreadfully in global health and poverty rankings .
there are campaigns spreading across university campuses to make their colleges conflict-free .
they &apos;d have to be available at very competitive rates .
she may be interested in providing local services to her community : babysitting , local deliveries , pet care .
suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of britain or the president of the u.s. , or the leader of any other developed nation , woke up and said , &quot; i &apos;m never going to be able to create all the jobs i need in the current climate .
it &apos;s about interfacing these markets direct into the highest official channels in the land .
so if there &apos;s a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training , an investor can pay for it and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals for maybe the next two years .
just -- actually , i was working at the time , doing production for a fashion photographer .
but we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world .
these two nuclei , when they &apos;re far apart , are charged .
and then we get to uranium .
but that &apos;s not really fusion power . that &apos;s just making some fusion happen .
but before tahrir was a global symbol of liberation , there were representative surveys already giving people a voice in quieter but still powerful ways .
while aspiring to democracy the most , they were the least likely population in the world to say that they had actually voiced their opinion to a public official in the last month -- at only four percent .
in the country once known for its passive resignation , where , as bad as things got , only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official , today 90 percent tell us that if there &apos;s a problem in their community , it &apos;s up to them to fix it .
but the parents in the room know that texting is actually the best way to communicate with your kids .
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline .
imagine having real time data on every one of those issues .
because it &apos;s not failure itself that constrains us .
that &apos;s still true today .
you see , hummingbirds are not hypersonic , but they are maneuverable .
today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko &apos;s foot .
tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months , and it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever .
you believed in impossible things and you were fearless .
superhero , superhero . superhero , superhero . superhero , superhero . superhero , superhero . superhero , superhero . voice : because that &apos;s what being a superhero is all about .
the hummingbird ?
i think that we learn as time goes on .
currently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
this story began four years ago .
i &apos;m used to algorithms and data structures and super motivated students , and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a raging , violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere .
when i started this program four years ago , i had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs .
it &apos;s that big .
and i feel blessed and fortunate that every week , every tuesday -- and actually every friday also -- i can once again celebrate in the marrow of my bones the very essence of living in israel on the edge .
my dad is white from cornwall , and my mom is black from zimbabwe .
i can hardly find the words to describe the peace i felt when i was acting .
i still valued self-worth above all other worth , and what was there to suggest otherwise ?
i was in congo in february , dancing and celebrating with women who &apos;ve survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways -- destroyed because other brutalized , psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves &apos; addiction to ipods , pads , and bling , which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain , their suffering , their death .
this is studios for artists .
it was voted the worst place in britain to live .
by the way , we had half the budget of the other western nations .
so finally , texture is something .
thomas heatherwick : building the seed cathedral
now -- the story might seem to good to be true , but when you administer batteries of psychological tests , you get the same results -- namely , identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities .
none of the dire professional consequences has taken place -- i haven &apos;t been exiled from the city of cambridge .
a paraphrase of a quote by virginia woolf , and there &apos;s some debate as to what she actually meant by that .
until the studies are redone with adoptive children , who provide an environment but not genes to their kids , we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid .
i &apos;m an apprentice , and i work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
i always watch the process done the first time before i try it .
and he says , &quot; like the humane society ? &quot;
&quot; push it further . &quot;
i got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
as a group , they &apos;re the happiest people i know .
that stuff -- safety -- safety first ?
i formed a theory , and i &apos;m going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds .
they look like the stuff we walk around with .
i &apos;ve got generalized anxiety disorder , which is a given .
do you want us to try and get you into broadmoor to meet tony ? &quot;
he said , &quot; i asked to see the prison psychiatrist .
i said , &quot; what &apos;s the story ? &quot;
and they didn &apos;t reply .
and i said , &quot; well , some psychologists might say that this makes you ... &quot; and he said , &quot; what ? &quot;
and we stitch them together like medieval monks .
he got into a fracas in a bar , he called it -- ended up going to jail for a month , which i know is bad , but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was , it wasn &apos;t too bad .
and ostensibly , the same is true of democracy .
that &apos;s not the way human circumstances operate .
we have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing , but completely inexperienced , volunteers .
now the day after we arrived , a new crisis began to unfold .
so in a panic , estelle from sanccob called the student and said , &quot; please , you have to make more . &quot;
well , you should care because they &apos;re an indicator species .
and then , can we replicate those actions ?
and this is a route of exhibition gardens , and edible towpaths , and bee-friendly sites , and the story of pollinators , and it &apos;s a route that we designed that takes people through the whole of our town , past our cafes and our small shops , through our market , not just to and fro from the supermarket , and we &apos;re hoping that , in changing people &apos;s footfall around our town , we &apos;re also changing their behavior .
across age , across income , across culture .
what should a community do with its unused land ? plant food , of course . with energy and humor , pam warhurst tells at the tedsalon the story of how she and a growing team of volunteers came together to turn plots of unused land into communal vegetable gardens , and to change the narrative of food in their community .
why ? because in compassion , when we feel with the other , we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there . and once we get rid of ego , then we &apos;re ready to see the divine .
as though that -- we call religious people often believers , as though that were the main thing that they do . and very often , secondary goals get pushed into the first place , in place of compassion and the golden rule .
we need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos , and to give guidelines . this charter would not be a massive document .
if you take some heart cells from an animal , and put it in a dish , they &apos;ll just sit there and beat .
so here we see , for example , a sponge spicule , two bits of coral here , that &apos;s a sea urchin spine . really some amazing stuff .
i think that this was best put by william blake when he said , &quot; to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower , hold infinity in the palm of your hand , and eternity in an hour . &quot;
so , the fashionistas don &apos;t really like me because it doesn &apos;t matter if kate moss is wearing it or if i &apos;m wearing it , it looks the same .
the walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete .
the one on the left is an x-ray .
the bus was done with a cargo-scanning x-ray machine , which is used on the borders between countries , looking for contraband and illegal immigrants .
but i could get a bit darker in the tube , but everything else would suffer .
so what i &apos;m going to do is , every now and again , i will make this gesture , and in a moment of powerpoint democracy , you can imagine what you &apos;d like to see .
that every person here , every decision that you &apos;ve made today , every decision you &apos;ve made in your life , you &apos;ve not really made that decision , but in fact , every single permutation of those decisions is made , each one going off into a new universe .
pain doesn &apos;t go away either .
i stopped observing the house for a moment , and when i started observing again , everything had happened . &quot;
thank you very much . goodbye .
how do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe you and i disagree .
it is not professor and convict , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
energy came to it in some form or shape , data came to it in some form or shape .
do you cook it ? do you have it served to you ?
until his death in 2006 , he was the all-powerful leader of turkmenistan , a central asian country rich in natural gas .
well , some of that sprang from our work .
the bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process , but it earned around 130 million dollars .
now , that &apos;s not bad going for a convicted money launderer .
and why have we , as americans particularly , become a nation that strives for security above all else ?
it gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what &apos;s inside them .
for eight years , she walked through the rift valley .
hi .
now , the first day of my graphic design training at penn state university , the teacher , lanny sommese , came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard , and wrote the word &quot; apple &quot; underneath , and he said , &quot; ok . lesson one . listen up . &quot;
and even back then , michael was on the cutting edge .
what does that mean ?
don &apos;t get me started .
not exactly jackie collins .
like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were a free kind of utopia .
my own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister .
kids need opportunities to lead and succeed .
fully 50 percent of my archive comes from habitats so radically altered that they &apos;re either altogether silent or can no longer be heard in any of their original form .
at the end of its breeding cycle , the great basin spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard-panned desert soil of the american west , where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are just right for it to emerge again .
and our ears tell us that the whisper of every leaf and creature speaks to the natural sources of our lives , which indeed may hold the secrets of love for all things , especially our own humanity , and the last word goes to a jaguar from the amazon .
and -- you see the picture at the bottom ?
it grows every year .
i dove onto ebay a couple of days ago just to see what was gong on , typed in world of warcraft , got 6,000 items .
i came across a student who &apos;s absolutely excellent at expressing himself , and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at ted had seen it .
we are interacting with our entertainment .
in all my driving games , i &apos;ve driven a total of 31,459 miles .
they &apos;re going to do it their way , using the tools that we &apos;ve created .
thank you .
the way i think of it is , we can &apos;t learn to see until we admit we &apos;re blind .
and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
and so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do .
we get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .
so once you have gravity , here &apos;s this -- increase the speed by something , increase the ship &apos;s speed .
and what we can do with our biology is going to shape our future and that of our children and that of their children -- whether we gain control over aging , whether we learn to protect ourselves from alzheimer &apos;s , and heart disease , and cancer .
before it &apos;s all done we are going to alter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed the world around us .
it &apos;s really wonderful when we hear , &quot; oh , 99.9 percent of the letters in the code are the same .
but there are more important things that are already occurring : embryo screening .
and it &apos;s going to deny us the information that we need to make wise decisions about how to use these technologies .
that &apos;s the way these things work .
and she said , &quot; oh , so is that true for humans too ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; but mom , you can &apos;t have kids . &quot;
so i go , &quot; you know , why don &apos;t we go on the internet , and maybe we can see ... like on wikipedia . &quot;
so i set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation .
so this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really .
john pepper there was the cardiac surgeon who did the actual work on me , but everyone else there had to contribute one way or another .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in poland .
they simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before .
i &apos;m so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that i &apos;m not prepared to tell you what it cost .
and i really hated the mosquitos for that .
but say you live in the tropics and you walk outside your hut one day and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt around your home .
but along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge , there &apos;s also a cultural challenge , and this is probably the part about malaria that people don &apos;t like to talk about .
but this , i think , introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties .
and yet we &apos;re asking people to use these nets every night .
it takes resources . it takes infrastructure .
ladies and gentlemen , the world has gotten smaller .
so i was cartooning live on a wide screen -- it was quite a sensation -- and then this guy came to me .
they were used first by a danish newspaper , which wanted to make a point on islam .
so this is really journalism in cartoons .
and cartoons can cross boundaries , as you have seen .
thank you .
well , &quot; rare earth &quot; actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public .
the sun increases in its intensity , in its brightness , and finally , at about 12 billion years after it first started , the earth is consumed by a large sun , and this is what &apos;s left .
but is this true ?
fifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles .
there are microbes which , through their metabolism , produce hydrogen sulfide , and they do so in large amounts .
i live in a view house now ; i &apos;m going to have waterfront .
i got this email from him two years ago ; he said , &quot; i think i &apos;ve got an answer to some of your questions . &quot;
does it leave a signal in bone or in plant ?
either way , they present us with a huge moral and ethical dilemma .
this is offshore .
and that was a stroke of absolute genius , because what they did was they harnessed the power of the contract , private power , to deliver public goods .
you can call yourself responsible , but responsibility without accountability often doesn &apos;t work .
and human rights comes down to a very simple proposition : can i give this person their dignity back ?
okay , there &apos;s a few heartbreaks that chocolate can &apos;t fix .
so here are three things i know to be true .
the bowery poetry club became my classroom and my home , and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well .
and i tell people that this is where great stories start from -- these four intersections of what you &apos;re passionate about and what others might be invested in .
not everyone can read music or owns a camera , but everyone can communicate in some way , and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from .
i would like to help others rediscover that wonder -- to want to engage with it , to want to learn , to want to share what they &apos;ve learned , what they &apos;ve figured out to be true and what they &apos;re still figuring out .
i start quickly becoming part of your past .
what happens at ground level , far from the halls of power , happens to ordinary citizens one by one .
the bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now .
nato forces went in , and the serbian army withdrew .
this is an msf hospital in cambodia .
the signature weapon of the war is the ied , and the signature wound is severe leg damage .
they trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly .
and remember , the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth , so if an election official wants to find out how you voted , they will not be able to .
you go to wikipedia and the first map you find is this .
so what we can conclude is you don &apos;t have to get rich to have few children .
with so different incomes , it &apos;s almost the same drop in number of babies per woman .
so what will happen now is what we call &quot; the big fill-up . &quot;
and we studied with a wise man , a guru named karoli baba , who then told me to get rid of the dress , put on a three-piece suit , go join the united nations as a diplomat and work for the world health organization .
and hemorrhagic smallpox , the most cruel of all , which had a predilection for pregnant women .
we had a scorecard that we wrote on every house .
in your ted packages there &apos;s a dvd , &quot; infinite vision , &quot; about dr. v and the aravind eye hospital .
within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world .
so instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu , we find it and immediately contain it .
now their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent because other nations have started to report .
other companies have sustainability strategies .
it uses lots of pesticides , lots of fertilizer , lots of water .
and it was clearly totally unacceptable , so then you have to act .
steve howard : let &apos;s go all-in on selling sustainability
i &apos;m deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are demonizing &quot; the other &quot; by the voice we &apos;re giving to the most divisive among us .
what issues deeply concern you ?
there &apos;s an angry divisive tension in the air that threatens to make modern politics impossible . elizabeth lesser explores the two sides of human nature within us that can be harnessed to elevate the way we treat each other . she shares a simple way to begin real dialogue -- by going to lunch with someone who doesn &apos;t agree with you , and asking them three questions to find out what &apos;s really in their hearts .
and he is probably the most prolific mass murderer alive on earth today .
liberia is now home to an all-woman united nations contingent of indian peacekeepers .
but the question that lingered in my mind was , what causes people to destroy fire trucks headed to their own homes ?
julian assange : yeah , can it possibly be true ?
and -- i mean , to cut a long story short -- word of the report leaked into kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
so this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
i mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
j yeah , we have a lot , but i mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
the controversial website wikileaks collects and posts highly classified documents and video . founder julian assange , who &apos;s reportedly being sought for questioning by us authorities , talks to ted &apos;s chris anderson about how the site operates , what it has accomplished -- and what drives him . the interview includes graphic footage of a recent us airstrike in baghdad .
the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day .
artist nathalie miebach takes weather data from massive storms and turns it into complex sculptures that embody the forces of nature and time . these sculptures then become musical scores for a string quartet to play .
however , it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab -- so i could finally start my project .
it got a bit more complicated from there .
but then on this side , with the same treatment , they &apos;re going up -- interesting .
at first , i just wanted to figure out which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients .
in the blue bar at the bottom of the graph , it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate , what her exhalation rate or lung health , should be based on her age , gender and height .
the doors open , the kids descend on this table of legs , and they are poking and prodding , and they &apos;re wiggling toes , and they &apos;re trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that .
you don &apos;t look disabled . &quot;
and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these -- look like jellyfish legs , also polyurethane .
guess who was the performing guest ?
after seven rounds of competition , i was the last one to survive it .
it shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions , which lacked transparency in the past .
so what do they do ? they have to share space -- squeezed in very limited space to save money -- and they call themselves &quot; tribe of ants . &quot;
and it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
so happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
there is nothing to eat up here , but the conditions were ideal for hibernation .
this two-and-a-half-inch bat has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue , the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world .
at ted2012 , filmmaker karen bass shares some of the astonishing nature footage she &apos;s shot for the bbc and national geographic -- including brand-new , previously unseen footage of the tube-lipped nectar bat , who feeds in a rather unusual way …
and so they appealed to lord blackstone to say these airplanes were trespassing .
this one you should be -- confidence . jesus survives . don &apos;t worry .
looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them to do something to make the system make more sense .
that realization is extraordinarily corrosive , extraordinarily corrupting .
and we didn &apos;t know that pleurococcus was out there , which is part of the reason why this whole species-mapping project is so important .
but it turns out that as we learn more about gene code and how to reprogram species , we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate dna .
in the measure that you have the source code , as all of you know , you can change the source code , and you can reprogram life forms so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine , or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials , which is why dupont is now growing a form of polyester that feels like silk in corn .
that &apos;s how the same gene code -- that &apos;s why you have 30,000 genes , mice have 30,000 genes , husbands have 30,000 genes .
it &apos;s free . no one &apos;s reading it . they &apos;re focusing on the war ; they &apos;re focusing on bush ; they &apos;re not interested in life .
just smart people moving bits . different rules .
scientific discoveries , futurist juan enriquez notes , demand a shift in code , and our ability to thrive depends on our mastery of that code . here , he applies this notion to the field of genomics .
my husband &apos;s like , &quot; honey , deception ?
think enron , madoff , the mortgage crisis .
lying &apos;s complex .
well there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass .
with body language , here &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to do .
we rehearse our words , but we rarely rehearse our gestures .
and in the presence of contempt , whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn &apos;t always follow -- look the other way , go the other direction , reconsider the deal , say , &quot; no thank you . i &apos;m not coming up for just one more nightcap . thank you . &quot;
pm : now i &apos;m going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother , erin runnion , confronting her daughter &apos;s murderer and torturer in court .
i just heard the best joke about bond emeruwa .
it comes from popular culture .
and it &apos;s important to remember that , because if we don &apos;t , then we become ahistorical .
a pakistani muslim teaching jewish holocaust history to young igbo children .
and as idris moves , fraser screams , &quot; stop !
but this is a good thing .
trouble in the valley , and trouble by the river too .
and let &apos;s see , you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar , and then you eat , and you eat , and you eat , and you -- she &apos;s about 300 pounds now .
and then , i made a lego animator .
i love toys !
let &apos;s make these things .
and originally , furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom .
and she starts doing all these different drawings and does color patterns and coloring books .
they only paid me , like , a little bit of money to do this , so i had to call a friend of a friend who was running the gm prototype plant , sla plant , that was down .
and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these .
and then , of course , you &apos;re not done yet .
they have seven processors , they have 14 motors , they have -- but you don &apos;t care , do you ?
this is john over here .
but i think , as a community , we still have a lot to learn .
real-time data turns on the lights .
that &apos;s how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people &apos;s potential .
it doesn &apos;t sound anything like &quot; wavin &apos; flag &quot; to me .
well , why is all of this so important ?
that &apos;s how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading , and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands ; they can save lives .
this is their baseline . this is what they think is natural because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .
the top head does account for most of the biomass , in some places up to 85 percent , like kingman reef , which is now protected .
one very clear way is the marine protected areas , especially no-take reserves that we set aside to allow for the recovery for marine life .
outside the reserve , you cannot even detect this .
so how much of this do we have ?
we really need to develop models , business models , where coastal conservation is an investment , because we already know that these marine reserves provide social , ecological and economic benefits .
you &apos;re saying we &apos;re spending 35 billion dollars now on subsidies .
and in the oceans , there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet .
this is really a world within a world , and we &apos;re going to show you two .
not only is it coming out of the earth -- so , biogenesis made from volcanic activity -- but that bacteria supports these colonies of life .
you can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here , and he &apos;ll bat it away with his claw . whack !
here &apos;s crabs here , worms here .
everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms .
this is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
and the textbook , i think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that -- which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
so i &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
because the small hadron collider once was the big thing .
he employed 200 people .
the remarkable thing about these girls , and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married .
if you want to attract people like juanderson who could , for instance , buy guns , wear jewelry , ride motorbikes and get girls through the drugs trade , and you want to attract him into education , having a compulsory curriculum doesn &apos;t really make sense .
you create peer-to-peer learning , or you create para-teachers , or you bring in specialist skills .
and it &apos;s the same wherever you go .
they &apos;re recognizably schools , but they look different .
thank you .
any parents out there of teenagers ? all we do is cook for these people -- they eat two , three , four dinners a night -- it &apos;s ridiculous !
there it is !
there are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don &apos;t show anyone who they really are right here at home . this isn &apos;t just about north carolina ; all those states that were clear , it &apos;s legal .
but many people today -- philosophers , artists , doctors , scientists -- are taking a new look at what i call the third act , the last three decades of life .
but that means that two-thirds of how well we do in the third act , we can do something about .
how was i supposed to live it ?
i mean , as girls , we start off feisty -- &quot; yeah , who says ? &quot;
most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen , and that &apos;s a very inefficient process , which is why it gets up our noses so much .
and here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic , because the mimic doesn &apos;t give it any nectar . it thought it would get some .
it &apos;s really horrible .
but if you look at the spectrum , birds and us , we see red , green and blue and see that spectrum .
jonathan drori : the beautiful tricks of flowers
so this was an amazing experience , and again , yes , it was a game , but they didn &apos;t write newspaper articles , people didn &apos;t say -- you know , really , &quot; i can die now because the red sox won . &quot; and many people did .
now , this was a big moment . maezza &apos;s dad is black , and i knew this day was coming . i wasn &apos;t expecting it at seven . i don &apos;t know why , but i wasn &apos;t .
and she was fascinated by this , and she started to cry , and i started to cry , and her father started to cry , and now we &apos;re all crying . he didn &apos;t expect to come home from work to the middle passage , but there it goes .
and so to me , this beautiful culture , this beautiful expression is something that i want to capture through games .
this is scrolling up the east coast .
and it &apos;s this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well , except for one thing : it &apos;s not a robot at all .
the amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to 46 minutes .
so what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what it was they were asked to do .
so basically motion through 3d space .
collaborator two : it really allows this last recording of his to be a living , breathing memorial .
but most importantly , i think , we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the johnny cash project , where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone .
so the word &quot; silhouette &quot; comes from a minister of finance , etienne de silhouette .
and i &apos;m making all those kinds of windows .
people tell me their lives , their memories , their aspirations , and i create a mindscape .
and running gives me a lot of energy .
so it &apos;s regional memories , and they are just randomly moved by the wind .
it &apos;s a story about transformation and connections .
it &apos;s perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm , to be free of career anxiety .
i think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods .
and yet , they &apos;re not .
it leads , in the worst cases , in the analysis of a sociologist like emil durkheim , it leads to increased rates of suicide .
when we think about failing in life , when we think about failure , one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income , a loss of status .
it would be insane to call hamlet a loser .
nonsense . you can &apos;t have it all . you can &apos;t .
so we should do everything we can , we should do everything we can to pursue it .
and i decided , it was an old dream that was lingering , that was from so many years ago , three decades ago -- the only sort of world class swim i had tried and failed at back in my 20s -- was going from cuba to florida .
and they were . they were prepared .
and i was thinking of the hypothermia and maybe some shoulder pain and all the other things -- the vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater .
so i swam through the night , and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots .
&quot; henry , what &apos;s your question ? &quot;
this hope is still alive .
but the future are digital medical wireless devices , ok ?
gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway , as today many of these things are dedicated gateways , because they are not so well integrated .
i didn &apos;t have one of those , but i got the fitbit .
it &apos;s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me you sleep better than expected .
the future of this though , is being able to move this to a band-aid type phenomenon , and that &apos;s not so far away .
and what it &apos;s trying to do is accelerate this era : to take unmet medical needs , to work and innovate -- and we just appointed the chief engineer , mehran mehregany , it was announced on monday -- then to move up with development , clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice , the most challenging thing of all , requiring attention to reimbursement , healthcare policy , healthcare economics .
so if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth , let &apos;s start with that . and since i got that idea , i &apos;ve had to shake hundreds of hands .
so one thing we can do is live longer .
thank you .
the next day i started with the medications and the therapy .
people think of depression as being just sadness .
a lot of the time , what they are expressing is not illness , but insight , and one comes to think what &apos;s really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don &apos;t distract us very much .
she sent me some of them .
but , &quot; he said to me , &quot; i heard about a protocol at mass general for a procedure called a cingulotomy , which is a brain surgery , and i think i &apos;m going to give that a try . &quot;
she said , &quot; there &apos;s one room in my new place for the boys and one room for the girls , but at night , they &apos;re just all up on my bed , and we &apos;re doing homework all together and everything .
and major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken .
so frank russakoff said to me , &quot; if i had it again to do over , i suppose i wouldn &apos;t do it this way , but in a strange way , i &apos;m grateful for what i &apos;ve experienced .
but that &apos;s not in any of those books .
once you start cutting things in half , you kind of get carried away , so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan .
so you photograph that in exactly the same position , and then you can substitute in -- and that part does use photoshop -- just the edges .
now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it .
2,438 pages .
and surgeons were tradesmen , rather than physicians .
laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery : surgery with long instruments through small incisions .
i talked about the large , complicated robot .
we need to see beyond the surface .
what i want instead , is for you to be whole , intact , and functional enough to go out and save the world , after you &apos;ve decided you need to do it .
but we had a problem .
mw : okay . well , it was partially my fault .
throughout this journey , we have also discovered our passion for science , and are currently continuing research on other fossil fuel chemicals in university .
in some it is hot .
this is an unusual installation of airport seating .
it worked better : &quot; h &quot; base , much more practical .
the familiar one on the lower right .
lower left is day-of-the-dead toys .
and it &apos;s all part of the , you know , they used to say , &quot; take your pleasure seriously . &quot;
cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here .
there are things like silver-plated thalis .
well , if you teach , if you worship in the temple of learning , do not mock the gods , because they will take you , fill you with curiosity and desire , and drive you . drive you with a passion to change things .
they are not causal , they are actually supporting factors .
continuing here in the studio with our guest michael o &apos;donohue , head of commodities at four continents capital management .
they key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups .
we do not buy people out of slavery .
she said , &quot; no , because we &apos;ve got hope now .
in classical physics , there is always some friction , some energy loss .
so , this is quantum locking -- actually locking -- three-dimensional locking of the superconductor .
now -- -- so we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors , so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields , such as needed in mri machines , particle accelerators and so on .
and these were steel , mica , plastic , copper and nickel .
again , this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world .
that &apos;s it without the case on .
so people say , &quot; what &apos;s going to happen when moore &apos;s law comes to an end ? &quot;
you can buy half a billion today , and they are actually better , because they are faster .
the amount of data we &apos;re getting about the brain is doubling every year .
it will be permanently headquartered in silicon valley , at the nasa ames research center .
but they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings .
in the world of blogs , there &apos;s going to be before the tsunami and after the tsunami , because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that , although initially -- that is , in that first day -- there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting , there was a dearth of live video and some people complained about this .
it would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of beans in the jar , and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you .
when we talk about bottom-up , decentralized phenomena , the ant colony is the classic metaphor , because , no individual ant knows what it &apos;s doing , but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions .
he says to me , &quot; we &apos;ve done some work around the country .
going to scratch his nose .
and the limiting step here wasn &apos;t the unknown diversity of life , but rather the taxonomic specialists who can identify and catalog these species that became the limiting step .
but this is no laughing matter .
so for example , they found something which was sold as tuna , which is very valuable , was in fact tilapia , which is a much less valuable fish .
but there &apos;s still potential for discovery of big and exciting things .
but you can imagine the biomass that represents .
and she said , &quot; oh no ! just dis everybody , except ralph nader . &quot;
fellow and urban designer mitchell joachim presents his vision for sustainable , organic architecture : eco-friendly abodes grown from plants and -- wait for it -- meat .
i can &apos;t tell you how reassured i was by the very last sentence in that glorious presentation by dean kamen a few days ago .
there has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days .
if you think about this question for any length of time , it &apos;s blindingly obvious why we have a brain .
now of course there are other moves , but with vast computers we approximate and come close to the optimal solution .
forget about trying to hit the bull &apos;s eye in darts , just aim for the same spot over and over again .
you accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories .
so as i shake this ketchup bottle , i get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row .
so the important point here is the right hand always does the same things -- sinusoidal movement .
so we &apos;ve made inferences , we &apos;ve done predictions , now we have to generate actions .
so what i actually get , based on this lovely , smooth , desired force , is a very noisy version .
so you think that people thinking about the brain , and consciousness generally , could get real insight by saying , where does movement play in this game ?
and yes , the red planet is red .
this is ice water on mars .
the reason there is a billion-year gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics , the crust of the earth has been recycled .
this is a 20-percent scale model .
this is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to mars .
we &apos;re ready to go . all we need is a check from nasa headquarters to cover the costs .
whatever .
and then , just some examples . this stuff really is sculpture .
the first lesson is that companies are really powerful , and that matters a lot . this is a story about how wal-mart went green , and what that means .
consumers don &apos;t really like these light bulbs .
here &apos;s a story about national policy that we could all learn from .
well , i &apos;ll tell you -- a lot .
and if it &apos;s business as usual , we &apos;re going out of business .
i think of new cities like dubai or ancient cities like rome with zaha hadid &apos;s incredible maxxi museum , or like right here in new york with the high line , a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this .
they typically make the best out of their conditions , and try to make their spaces look nice and homey , or at least up until as far as they can reach .
while these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid , each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for garbage-related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space .
in these villages , you see an entirely altered landscape , and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square , rectangular houses which sit seven meters below the ground .
and if everything goes smoothly , one to two weeks from now you &apos;ll know where the epidemic was today .
but not all positions in the network are the same .
your friends have more friends than you do , and this is known as the friendship paradox .
it could depend on the nature of the pathogen -- different pathogens , using this technique , you &apos;d get different warning -- or other phenomena that are spreading , or frankly , on the structure of the human network .
would you get any population-level immunity ?
one is fully passive , like i just described -- as in , for instance , the trucker example , where we don &apos;t actually intervene in the population in any way .
the librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives , &quot; what are the names of santa &apos;s reindeer ? &quot;
they bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
it feels the force , understands that chris is there and doesn &apos;t push through him and hurt him .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older and older .
so they don &apos;t have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them .
to date , with the help of a global network of partners , we &apos;ve completed close to fifty projects .
last march , we received very sad news .
so 14 years ago , almost , in the middle of the rwandan genocide , in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated by the rwandan government and some extremist militia .
to call it a movement , as with all movements , perhaps , is a little misleading .
so this movement , if it &apos;s to be durable and global , will have to cross borders , and you will have to see other citizens in democracies , not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide , but actually making it such .
he was in sudan when the civil war broke out there .
so sergio -- this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness , lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue .
and i think that &apos;s something that we have to be in the room , whether it &apos;s nixon going to china or khrushchev and kennedy or reagan and gorbachev .
thank you .
but it never struck me as it did that moment , because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby , and she had no milk to nurse .
this is something that can be transformed with knowledge .
in countries where girls don &apos;t go to school and you offer a meal to girls in school , we see enrollment rates about 50 percent girls and boys .
we &apos;re seeing that now in the horn of africa where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas over last year .
when a leader says , &quot; not under my watch , &quot; everything begins to change .
they way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition : does it look normal ? does it look abnormal ?
you then have some body part descriptions : &quot; it &apos;s in the liver , in the breast , in the prostate . &quot;
and there &apos;s a very important distinction there that we &apos;ll get to .
you know , i was very fortunate to meet danny hillis a few years ago .
well , the bad news is that these robust -- and robust is a key word -- emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail .
the wild thing about that trial also , was that it reduced new primaries , so new cancers , by 30 percent also .
so , the problem is that the clinical trial was done , and we were a part of it , and in the fundamental clinical trial -- the pivotal clinical trial we call the phase three , we refused to use a placebo .
but if one is unfortunate to get a disease , you &apos;ll go into your doctor &apos;s office , he or she will take a drop of blood , and we will start to know how to treat your disease .
thank you very much .
and i have a tip for you . if you have to work in spaces like that , carry headphones with you , with a soothing sound like birdsong .
first , make it congruent , pointing in the same direction as your visual communication .
and in the process , i became the first person in history to make the entire 650-mile journey , from hercules inlet to south pole , solely on feet , without skis .
where do you sleep ? we slept in a tent that was very low to the ground , because the winds on antarctica were so extreme , it would blow anything else away .
fifty years ago , when i began exploring the ocean , no one -- not jacques perrin , not jacques cousteau or rachel carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it .
the poet auden said , &quot; thousands have lived without love ; none without water . &quot;
but i asked him : &quot; when are you going to finish it ?
that &apos;s bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton .
but business as usual means that in 50 years , there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing , because the fish will simply be gone .
the next 10 years may be the most important , and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life .
i grew up watching star trek . i love star trek .
the engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating .
when we think of brain , we of course imagine our own brain .
but up in the corner , in the right corner , you &apos;ll see , at the same scale , a visual interneuron from a fly .
so this is basically multiplexing in time .
but non-spiking neurons are actually quite complicated because they can have input synapses and output synapses all interdigitated , and there &apos;s no single action potential that drives all the outputs at the same time .
what they do is they introduce a noise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other .
we &apos;re just packing in columns , so that we &apos;d have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions .
and when you think of the fabric of the brain , the structure , how is it built ? what is the pattern of the carpet ?
but what you do need is a very big computer .
there is a lot more to do to test these theories , and to test any other theories .
so put that library at the bottom of that ship -- that &apos;s how big the thing was going to be .
they built a high-explosive propelled model .
you know , it was going to be a nice long trip .
yet , it &apos;s 160 years old .
what we do is when we apply the nanopatch to the skin as so -- -- immediately a few things happen .
so what if you &apos;ve targeted cells ?
as the name suggests -- the cold chain -- it &apos;s the requirements of keeping a vaccine right from production all the way through to when the vaccine is applied , to keep it refrigerated .
thank you .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write , because there is so much feedback you can get from people .
the bottom one ? yellow .
when you ask people this question , they usually think that it has to be something about culture .
they are residing in the person who is designing that form .
and then they said to half the physicians , they said , &quot; yesterday you reviewed the patient &apos;s case and you realized that you forgot to try one medication .
now , a weekend in paris , a weekend in rome , these are different things ; they have different food , different culture , different art .
but now if you have an option that nobody wants , you can take it off . right ?
the answer was absolutely yes .
thank you very much .
in hospitals , they are security issues .
14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already .
and then what we have here is a little hole .
capacity : we have 10,000 times more spectrum , 10,000 times more leds installed already in the infrastructure there .
this is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean .
people never want to say , i really don &apos;t understand .
so , up to this point we tried to fix it by using what i call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology , which means , well , let &apos;s just throw chemicals at it , and maybe it &apos;s going to make it work .
so , what can we do with genomes now that we can read them , now that we &apos;re starting to have the book of life ?
they &apos;re not grown from seeds ; they &apos;re grafted into root stock ; they would not exist in nature on their own .
they &apos;re here . they &apos;re in the universe .
i mean , you lose .
like , &quot; oh , i &apos;m sorry you had to beat me . i &apos;m really sorry , yes , it &apos;s my fault . &quot;
then we phase out the food as a lure , and now the dog knows that &quot; sit &quot; means sit , and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed english sentence .
it &apos;s like , if i just sit , that &apos;s my command .
the dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours , while she cooked dinner , because we had a lot of aggression related towards food .
kick , kick , kick .
it really is .
and i want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation .
our mandate is media , and particularly the book . &quot;
they &apos;re super-efficient . we had a very low budget to work with .
i can show this to you later .
the proscenium line can also disappear .
and now we &apos;re going to add 1.1 million square feet .
architect joshua prince-ramus takes the audience on dazzling , dizzying virtual tours of three recent projects : the central library in seattle , the museum plaza in louisville and the charles wyly theater in dallas .
wk : yeah .
so that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?
biological -- there &apos;s autoimmune diseases , where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host , or the person .
and rarer still when accompanied , as in my case , by self-awareness and a mastery of language .
five is yellow .
easy when you know how .
the world is richer , vaster than it too often seems to be .
i &apos;ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it &apos;s almost impossible .
you can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange -- and indeed there &apos;s reciprocity in other animals -- but the exchange of one object for another never happens .
you find a sheep . you kill it . you get the fat out of it .
they &apos;re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than louis xiv even had .
their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
what happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
it &apos;s completely irrelevant .
that &apos;s 15 minutes of our cup consumption .
this is just lots and lots of cigarettes : 65,000 cigarettes , which is equal to the number of teenagers who will start smoking this month , and every month in the u.s .
chris jordan : turning powerful stats into art
you can actually be making dna chips in your garage and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly . it &apos;s a lot of fun .
what about real people ?
these different blocks represent the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family , so you can kind of go down the blocks and see where the signal is .
they had to intubate her , so they put a tube down her throat and they began to mechanically ventilate her .
for maybe about 10 percent of prostate cancer , there are folks that are predisposed to it .
this is a collaboration between myself and don .
this is the starting point for designing a battery -- two electrodes , in this case metals of different composition , and an electrolyte , in this case salt dissolved in water .
and i did .
now do i hire seasoned professionals ?
that &apos;s enough energy to meet the daily electrical needs of 200 american households .
what happens when a black man visits aspen ? singer / songwriter stew and his band are about to let you know .
so we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation .
and it wasn &apos;t until later , as i started making games , that -- i really actually think of them more as toys .
now , we actually play through many generations here , at the cellular scale .
so pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game .
so the process of playing the game is a process of building up this huge database of content . and pretty much everything you &apos;re going to see in this game , there &apos;s an editor for in the game that the player can create , all the way up through civilization . this is my baby .
some of these were created by the player , others by other players and automatically sent over here .
so here &apos;s our little solar system , as we pull away from our melted planet here .
but we also have stars and things as well .
and those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
we make ourselves small . we don &apos;t want to bump into the person next to us .
so powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
from their baseline when they come in , high-power people experience about a 20-percent increase , and low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease .
they &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . they &apos;re blind to the conditions .
you &apos;re just going to do it and do it and do it , even if you &apos;re terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience , until you have this moment where you say , &apos; oh my gosh , i &apos;m doing it .
and yet many darwinians are anxious , a little uneasy -- would like to see some limits on just how far the darwinism goes .
many people have laid down their lives for communism , and many have laid down their lives for capitalism .
and it &apos;s just about a full-time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another .
it &apos;s part of their plan .
that will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties .
and how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great british veteran conductor sir colin davis who said , &quot; conducting , charles , is like holding a small bird in your hand .
south africans just make music really freely .
okay , we &apos;ll play it for you again now , and we &apos;re going to highlight , we &apos;re going to poke out the t , e , d .
it &apos;s going to be britain &apos;s first ever national disabled orchestra .
now one day in 1772 , the prince decreed that the musicians &apos; families , the orchestral musicians &apos; families , were no longer welcome in the castle .
that this traveled into the goodwill in virginia , and moved its way into the larger industry , which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to africa and asia .
who are these people ?
we can send people to the moon ; we can see if there &apos;s life on mars -- why can &apos;t we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people ?
children can sleep through the night ; the house looks beautiful ; you hang them in the window .
and it &apos;s a big family reunion , and yet , like many family reunions , it &apos;s not all peace and light .
how many of you in the last years have ever found yourself worrying about the middle east and wondering what anyone could do ?
terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear .
we showed it could be done . it was an amazing journey .
it &apos;s not easy , of course , but it &apos;s possible .
over the last 28 years , this tough , grinding , dirty work has been done by literally thousands of people around australia , and more recently overseas , and their work has proven that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments .
and the highest priority , you see on the screen , is washing people once a day , particularly children .
not well designed , not beautiful , not elegant -- just that they function .
it &apos;s one of the almost rock-solid pieces of evidence , which i &apos;ve never seen evidence for , that &apos;s always ruled out as that &apos;s the problem with indigenous housing .
when the bug was in the gut , he &apos;d send back by return post some dung beetles .
i put it to you , is this eliminating poverty ?
and no , i &apos;m not a meter maid , and i &apos;m not an undertaker .
and what i &apos;ve realized is that political persuasion doesn &apos;t begin with ideas or facts or data .
i get a lot of really nice letters , lots of them .
almost all of my kids live below poverty .
and this is what my kids are doing , making living wage .
except what about locally ?
and we &apos;re building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down .
no air jordans were ever ruined on my farm .
self-sustaining entities , 18 months return on investment , plus we &apos;re paying people living wage and health benefits , while feeding people for pennies on the dollar .
and along the way , please take time to smell the flowers , especially if you and your students grew them .
so we have to try these devices out because the fda won &apos;t just let us use them on people unless we try it out first , and the best model for this happens to be pigs .
that &apos;s not very nice , but , after all , we had to find out what the answer is .
then it goes to a network operations center , where they get your data from your patient database that &apos;s been put in at some central location , say , in the united states .
christina sidebottom : well , my first reaction was that it was -- looked awfully gun-like , and it was very strange .
the comprehensive solution : this is the device ; it &apos;s about one inches by two inches and , oddly enough , just the thickness of most cranial bones .
the present portable device is far from optimally designed , both as to human factors as appearance .
however , if a video is there that everything was explained to you , and you have it all in the video file , it &apos;ll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency , because it won &apos;t be nearly as good a case .
what we are looking at is the first three hours .
handwriting is a disappearing art .
they &apos;ve been swept away over the last two decades by these types of world-flattening digitization technologies , right ?
instead of editions coming out every two years , of a book , imagine it coming out every 25 seconds .
they &apos;re actually developing a lot of their science and engineering curriculum to spread widely around the world in our system and they &apos;re also trying to develop all of their software tools completely open-source .
how many people know about xml ?
we can share and rip , mix and burn , but in fact that &apos;s all illegal .
it didn &apos;t take long until people started contributing materials , for example , on lingerie , which is actually a pretty good module .
and that is that we all in this room learned how to walk , how to talk , not by being taught how to talk , or taught how to walk , but by interacting with the world , by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something , or being able to stand up and reach it .
we &apos;re interested in perfect color uniformity .
now people clap , sometimes you even get standing ovations and i say , &quot; what the hell &apos;s wrong with you ? why are we all sitting there ? &quot;
i &apos;ll let jim decide which way to send it afterwards . ok .
it &apos;s a little bit like the fact that automobiles -- thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the united states ; not one single post office truck is stolen . ok . and why ?
nicholas negroponte : one laptop per child
so , in the same way that you wake up , take a shower and get dressed , you have to learn to do that for your digital self .
and i thought , &quot; oh , wow . i found it . this is great . &quot;
it actually looks very organic .
and to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to south africa , it just pales , because in south africa , each year 300,000 mothers with hiv give birth to children .
meds don &apos;t equal medical care .
our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained .
and the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings , &quot; i have something to tell you . i &apos;m hiv-positive . &quot;
the second , communities -- empowering women .
all of this is possible , if we each contribute to this fight .
so a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the adolescent brain is using functional mri to look at changes in brain activity across age .
so we sometimes laugh about teenagers .
why do teenagers seem so much more impulsive , so much less self-aware than grown-ups ? cognitive neuroscientist sarah-jayne blakemore compares the prefrontal cortex in adolescents to that of adults , to show us how typically &quot; teenage &quot; behavior is caused by the growing and developing brain .
he said , &quot; is the robot real ? &quot;
and the last project also has to do with medical robotics .
i invite all of you to think about the innovations that you &apos;re interested in , the machines that you wish for , and think about what they might be telling you , because i have a hunch that many of our technological innovations , the devices we dream about , can inspire us to be better humans .
your brain works exactly the same way , responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal .
children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging .
how do you do it ?
thanks .
without you , i &apos;m just a guy talking to an empty room , and i spent a lot of time last week doing that , and it &apos;s not the same as this .
now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite .
he wraps it around my leg , picks me up a second time , walks me to a vehicle , and he &apos;s able to get me to medical attention .
she got visibly -- ears came forward , she had a full go of it and halfway up , her legs gave way , and she fell backwards .
pm : and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve done today . bv : oh , thank you .
what do we mean by beyond ourselves ?
it &apos;s so easy to think of technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect storage devices like technology .
and i woke up from my visualization and i said , who was that ? i couldn &apos;t tell if it was shabana azmi or rekha , two very famous indian actresses , like the meryl streeps of india .
it really teaches us who we are , and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world , but it &apos;s really my creativity that &apos;s taught me that i can be much more than what my education told me i am .
they do this because they &apos;ve stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again .
so next time you &apos;re at the grocery store , think local , choose organic , know your farmer and know your food .
bring it over here and open it up . aaaah !
and then this is books sold -- the logarithmic scale .
we had dr. larry brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox .
&quot; free bird . &quot;
now i don &apos;t know about you , but michael shermer talked about the willingness for human beings -- evolutionarily , they &apos;re designed to see patterns in things .
luckily , i was the recipient of the ted prize this year .
but when i got there , i found lots of plastic garbage and other debris .
but tell me where they are and the country that owns them . &quot;
well they exist in the republic of kiribati , and kiribati is located in the central pacific in three island groups .
so i said , &quot; okay , i &apos;m happy to buy lunch .
so we had very strong leadership , very good vision and a lot of science , a lot of lawyers involved .
and that insured that we could move this forward and it would have both the self-interest of kiribati as well as the self-interest of the world .
i did some quick calculations . i took the last 20 years of gdp growth and the last 20 years of labor productivity growth and used those in a fairly straightforward way to try to project how many jobs the economy was going to need to keep growing , and this is the line that i came up with .
so , in short , yeah , the droids are coming for our jobs .
economies don &apos;t run on energy . they don &apos;t run on capital , they don &apos;t run on labor . economies run on ideas .
robots and algorithms are getting good at jobs like building cars , writing articles , translating -- jobs that once required a human . so what will we humans do for work ? andrew mcafee walks through recent labor data to say : we ain &apos;t seen nothing yet . but then he steps back to look at big history , and comes up with a surprising and even thrilling view of what comes next .
you know , of course , they are related to this combination of at least two of them being , you know , design objects .
this is , you know , the movie poster .
he &apos;s from korea originally .
and then we did one more of these .
it happens mainly under two conditions .
cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the u.s .
my family &apos;s first tv set in 1948 had only three knobs that i quickly mastered : an on-off switch , a volume knob , and a channel selector knob .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s , 70s , 80s and 90s , who are still active as investment managers , farmers , lawyers and doctors .
consider this : like the prophets , all the superheroes are missing parents .
and now it &apos;s 2010 , and there are 99 heroes from 99 different countries .
and the last point about the 99 noor stones is this .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s not me . &quot;
and that led to all kinds of things , from being in curricula in universities and schools to -- one of my favorite pictures i have from south asia , it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school .
you are noora the light .
and the first one was about a group called the party of god , who wanted to ban valentine &apos;s day . red was made illegal .
you know , i think that there &apos;s a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas .
then of course , the iraq war , predicted to cost just 60 billion back in 2003 .
why ?
i wonder if i could make my life beautiful .
it &apos;s got to be america , right ?
and if it can do that , maybe it can also change your behavior .
but not too uncomfortable , because there &apos;s something unthreatening about seeing a political perspective , versus being told or forced to listen to one .
and do not get the impression that this is very subjective .
this is one page of work from a chemist &apos;s workbook , ok ?
if you look on this , imagine a piano keyboard .
electrons are fuzzy creatures , and they can jump across gaps , but only at equal energy . if the energy differs , they can &apos;t jump .
calculate the vibrations , the purple spectrum is that new fellow , the white one is the old one .
and what is interesting is that often , even if we &apos;re in the 21st century , we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state .
and so to think again , there &apos;s no reason that you should believe me , so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on , but you might want to take it out , your iphone .
why ? because , as many of us know , v.c. is actually quite short-term .
one out of 10 experiments has any success .
the brazilian development bank , which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology , they just announced a 56 billion program for the future on this , is retaining equity in these investments .
perhaps a stealth thing .
tax forms , credit agreements , healthcare legislation : they &apos;re crammed with gobbledygook , says alan siegel , and incomprehensibly long . he calls for a simple , sensible redesign -- and plain english -- to make legal paperwork intelligible to the rest of us .
so anyway , she comes here , 1967 , she &apos;s pregnant , and she comes from ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the emperor haile selassie , and she lands months before the enoch powell speech , the &quot; rivers of blood &quot; speech .
twenty-four hours later , my social worker , this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months , he &apos;s waiting for me in the car as i say goodbye to my parents .
but i &apos;m reporting back to you to say quite simply that you can define how strong a democracy is by how its government treats its child .
why haven &apos;t we allowed innovation to happen ?
yet not in education . why ?
because our business has refused to use science .
we know health services matter .
so how much money did we just spend on all of that ?
they get angry if you do something different .
what did we spend in afghanistan this year ?
so sometimes they don &apos;t have it inside , and they &apos;re , like , &quot; you know , i don &apos;t want to do this , but i know my mother &apos;s going to be mad . &quot;
my mother was certainly the most important in mine .
if every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track , that would be me , stoking the train without a qualm in the world .
lean against me , calm your fears , count thy blessings , not thy years .
aye , that it does .
but human nature doesn &apos;t change , mate .
pale she was , listless ; and soft to the touch .
and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes .
two million years ago at lake turkana , homo erectus , one of our human ancestors , actually lived in this region .
just to put this in terms of generations , because people do find it hard to think of time , homo erectus left africa 90,000 generations ago .
but we have to control our numbers , because we can &apos;t really hold it together as a species .
the key that the marquis du lafayette sent to george washington to celebrate the storming of the bastille .
but now there was potentially this new category of things that i could sculpt that was different , that i -- you know , i have my own r2d2 , but that &apos;s -- honestly , relative to sculpting , to me , that &apos;s easy .
now , the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie , when they finally bring out the bird at the end , and they place it on the table , they actually spin it .
yeah , no , really , this was like aah -- why didn &apos;t i remember this ?
my head was cut open across the front , lifted back , exposing the skull underneath .
i had no idea . that &apos;s the sort of thing that happens to someone else , not me , surely .
and even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward , there were moments of incredible depth and richness , of authenticity and connection that i had never experienced before .
and then i remembered my friends that were still in the spinal ward , particularly maria .
i said , &quot; pass me the yellow pages . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you take the controls , and you fly towards that mountain . &quot;
and then it no longer matters what you look like , where you come from , or what you do for a living .
industrial design is the art form of the 21st century .
it makes the product strong , the tessellation .
i studied cooking in school for four years , and in that experience , which was called &quot; domestic science , &quot; it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification .
this is what exists in nature . observation now allows us to bring that natural process into the design process every day . that &apos;s what i do .
this is some current work i &apos;m doing .
the only place that didn &apos;t laugh was moscow .
i built this thing for my studio .
world &apos;s first bamboo bike with folding handlebars .
a copper jelly mold .
you don &apos;t see luminescence until the submersible begins to move forward through the water , but as it does , animals bumping into the screen are stimulated to bioluminesce .
and then when it &apos;s not using it , it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your lamborghini .
she always knows where he is , and she doesn &apos;t have to be monogamous , because some of these females come up with multiple males attached .
the other primary way is we go down with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles .
four hours into the deployment , we had programmed the electronic jellyfish to come on for the first time .
one was sick and the other one was healthy , so he had to make sure they ate the proper food .
mr : it should do a pretty good job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details of kim kardashian &apos;s wedding .
this is a ph probe .
i mean , how must you feel when you read this stuff and you see what you &apos;ve unlocked ?
and we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our titanics .
so i went out , collected the duck , and before i put it in the freezer , i checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex .
dan won his prize in medicine for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine works better than low-priced fake medicine .
at least , i thought it was till i got these slides .
in 2003 , i started a project with computer scientist adam montandon , and the result , with further collaborations with peter kese from slovenia and matias lizana from barcelona , is this electronic eye .
if i had to go to a funeral , though , i would dress in b minor , which would be turquoise , purple and orange .
so , also voices , i can transform speeches into color , for example , these are two very well-known speeches .
it &apos;s a little bit like the invasion of the body snatchers .
now for 20 years , tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control .
well , the healthcare system has been transformed : a culture pervaded with defensiveness , universal distrust of the system of justice , universal practice of defensive medicine .
well , actually there is a reason : environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned for any major project taking the better part of a decade , then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn &apos;t like the project .
pretty soon the doctor &apos;s saying , &quot; well , i doubt if that headache could be a tumor , but who would protect me if it were ? so maybe i &apos;ll just order the mri . &quot;
this is what we have , the philosophy we have to change to .
so , what &apos;s needed is a basic shift in philosophy .
if things aren &apos;t going right , the first response is : let &apos;s make more rules , let &apos;s set up a set of detailed procedures to make sure that people will do the right thing .
and in particular , the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that aristotle called &quot; practical wisdom . &quot;
he had a pretty low-wage job .
judge forer had to follow the law .
psychologists have known about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything for 30 years .
under normal sentencing procedures , judge russell would have had little choice but to sentence pettengill to serious jail-time as a drug felon .
and the way they do it is to give third-year medical students patients who they follow for an entire year .
in an intimate talk , barry schwartz dives into the question &quot; how do we do the right thing ? &quot; with help from collaborator kenneth sharpe , he shares stories that illustrate the difference between following the rules and truly choosing wisely .
the other thing to do is to knock the product , attack the brand myth , as we &apos;ve said .
she &apos;s going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount of money off our government for looking after what &apos;s happened to her .
when we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists , everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots . now it &apos;s got a title . everyone &apos;s doing it .
the advantages of dialogue are obvious .
a lot of people say that communism was defeated by the rolling stones . it &apos;s a good theory .
and basically , we lived for all those years , and some might argue that we still do , in a situation of being on the brink , literally , of an apocalyptic , planetary calamity .
they would propose -- actually there were about six volumes written on this -- a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the united states having three to four days warning that the soviets were going to attack us .
the global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about 1,300 , at the low end , to about 2,100 metric tons .
he wrote many , many times statements to this effect : &quot; we have the right to kill four million americans , two million of whom should be children . &quot;
here we go . ok .
so , response planning in the twenty-first century is both possible and is essential .
now , this is my favorite civil defense slide , and i -- -- i don &apos;t want to be indelicate , but this -- he &apos;s no longer in office . we don &apos;t really care , ok .
how have we tended to see the solutions to these social problems , these many issues that we face in society ?
why is that ?
because if we can make a profit , we can do it for 10 , 100 , a million , 100 million , a billion .
business does not profit from causing social problems , actually not in any fundamental sense .
there &apos;s a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems , and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business .
you know , cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy .
so our doctors said these are eye candies .
and this is another way to learn anatomy .
what were scientists called before ?
reading one of herschel &apos;s books was such a watershed moment for charles darwin that he would later say , &quot; scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me .
by the 19th century , it had become a kind of gentleman &apos;s club populated mainly by antiquarians , literary men and the nobility .
laura snyder : the philosophical breakfast club
so it &apos;s actually life , but it &apos;s actually not as we thought life would be .
and this was steen rasmussen .
they all have their own type of frequency distribution , but it &apos;s robust .
so let &apos;s see what that looks like .
christoph adami : finding life we can &apos;t imagine
we have paper forms to track people who come into clinics .
but to me , the most significant thing that i saw in 1995 was this .
it &apos;s always guys that look pretty much like me flying from countries that look pretty much like this to other countries with people with darker skin .
now we knew , when we built this system , the whole point of it , just like with the palm pilots , collect the data and immediately upload the data and get your data set .
so , you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown , you have the non-obvious , you have the non-seen , for the people who don &apos;t dare to go through the ice .
the pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas , because new ideas are so easy to have .
we don &apos;t have enough gas to fly so slow . &quot;
it allowed to do all those things there .
and with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane , we can produce the same energy than 200 little lightbulbs .
this is a painting from magritte , in the museum in holland that i love so much .
but what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on mp3 players .
except this isn &apos;t the cause , is it ?
africa is a continent in flames .
someone &apos;s put a brick through the window .
probably because when we admit we can do something about it , we &apos;ve got to do something about it .
not only in lives saved , but in goodwill , stability and security that we &apos;ll gain .
i believe it &apos;s possible .
we can make history .
i am , of course , referring to none other than elvis presley .
second step , conceptual synesthesia .
the participants had to identify , as quickly as possible , the literally false sentences .
just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words , we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor .
and take us through those , and introduce us to another yemen .
i &apos;ve guessed you &apos;ve already noticed this by now .
and we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today .
it &apos;s an independent newspaper , but tell that to the people in charge .
you spoke about the responsibility of the press .
my heart was three-and-a-half sizes too big .
if you go through a metal detector , you &apos;ll probably die .
my fingers started turning blue , and i was like , &quot; what is going on here ? &quot;
i finally decided it was time to take my doctor &apos;s advice .
one year ago to this very day , i woke up .
and these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors .
and you can see these large , yolked-up eggs bursting through the surface of this male &apos;s testes .
th : and what penelope says here is even more true .
perflourooctanoic acid .
the problem is , in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , we don &apos;t see that connection .
here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the l.a. airport .
here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected .
and in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world , he doesn &apos;t hold out much hope for that , either .
so 60 seconds was how long it took for the physical earthquake to travel .
well , it can be quite difficult , but you have to know what to look for .
so this video , i &apos;m not going to show you the whole thing , because it &apos;s quite gruesome , but you &apos;ll hear some of the sounds .
but here &apos;s the thing . algorithms are rules . they &apos;re binary .
and chris , if you could take the end of that tape measure ?
my wife and i adore our children .
when you get near the top of the tree , you feel like you can &apos;t fall -- in fact , it &apos;s difficult to move .
we &apos;re looking at that yellow box .
the eastern hemlock tree has often been described as the redwood of the east .
ants are not known to occur in redwood trees , curiously enough , and we wondered whether this ant , this species of ant , was only endemic to that one tree , or possibly to that grove .
traffic was horrific , and we were coming from the other side of town in the north part of jerusalem .
he was on coumadin .
they never get stuck in traffic . they could even go on a sidewalk .
all i need is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me , passionate about saving lives , and willing to do it .
let &apos;s take a look .
yes , there &apos;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .
and they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
in fact , this guy drives a mercedes-benz s600 v12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower .
everything is reliant on these computers working .
it can predict complex negotiations or situations involving coercion -- that is in essence everything that has to do with politics , much of what has to do with business , but sorry , if you &apos;re looking to speculate in the stock market , i don &apos;t predict stock markets -- ok , it &apos;s not going up any time really soon .
if we &apos;re talking about national security problems , maybe it &apos;s the secretary of state , maybe it &apos;s the secretary of defense , the director of national intelligence , maybe the ambassador to the united nations , or somebody else who they think is going to know more about the particular problem .
that &apos;s not my claim , that &apos;s a cia claim -- you can read it , it was declassified a while ago . you can read it in a volume edited by h. bradford westerfield , yale university press .
how secure is the theocratic regime in iran ?
they are growing in political clout , as the mullahs are isolating themselves -- with the exception of one group of mullahs , who are not well known to americans .
so , if you &apos;re in the audience today , or maybe you &apos;re watching this talk in some other time or place , you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem .
and then they benefit through the exposure , advertising and linked sales .
and each of these can vary by country .
they want to teach me about my destiny .
now science may dismiss this methodology , but polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel .
and what he meant was , if you are voyaging and far from home , your very survival depends on everyone aboard .
you know ? most of us here have great minds , right ?
whether it be your business , your contribution to society , money -- whatever it is for you -- your body , your family .
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t have the ...
an emotion , then , creates what we &apos;re going to do or the action .
your model of the world is what shapes you long term .
bullshit . you like the surprises you want .
even if you lie to yourself , you need to have split personalities .
so , i don &apos;t tell you that to brag ; i tell you because i &apos;m proud of human beings , because they get excited to contribute once they &apos;ve had the chance to experience it , not talk about it .
10 seconds .
and it appears that , some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night , until she reappeared in the morning .
and so what i do is , i write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints , and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them -- what they feel , what they think , what &apos;s different in the world today than usual , these sorts of questions .
and you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected . and in that way , you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy .
you can see the little pink cursor moving along , representing our position .
this is in response to , what &apos;s beautiful ? &quot; miss world . &quot;
and it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky .
in universe , there &apos;s kind of no end . it just goes infinitely , and you can just kind of click on stuff .
the superstars of climate change in 2006 : united states , britain , china . you know , these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept .
it &apos;s just that these days , us adults seem reluctant to allow ourselves the indulgence of just allowing our imaginations to drift along in the breeze , and i think that &apos;s a pity .
and these winds up there can be very , very fierce .
they are an expression of the majestic architecture of our atmosphere .
i will start by posing a little bit of a challenge : the challenge of dealing with data , data that we have to deal with in medical situations .
so we have to do something that &apos;s a little bit more intelligent than doing this .
so i &apos;m going to show you a few examples of what we can do .
here &apos;s another violent case . this really didn &apos;t kill the person .
so in this particular situation , it &apos;s a scan of a living person .
so i could present things to him while he &apos;s in the scanner .
and we &apos;ve been experimenting with this .
now in terms of the whole world &apos;s population , that already puts me in the top 1.95 richest people , which raises the question of , who is it i &apos;m working for ?
actually , we &apos;ve got ourselves locked into this industrial era mindset which says that the only people who can make cities are large organizations or corporations who build on our behalf , procuring whole neighborhoods in single , monolithic projects , and of course , form follows finance .
and we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture .
the only difference between traditional vernacular architecture and open-source architecture might be a web connection , but it &apos;s a really , really big difference .
so i thought i &apos;d start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why i lead this schizophrenic life .
and these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in africa -- inventive kids , intellectual kids -- and starved of opportunity .
and i &apos;ll just share a cartoon of this idea here .
we need to make the best mathematical models we can , the most consistent ones .
well , the transition to democracy in south africa in 1994 was literally a dream come true for many of us .
well , we designed aims as a 24-hour learning environment , and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning .
we &apos;re well on the way to achieving our initial goal .
this is ezra . she &apos;s from darfur .
it won &apos;t be easy .
it &apos;s got 120,000 processors ; they can basically process 10 quadrillion bits of information per second .
you &apos;ve got this huge network of cells interacting with each other -- about 100 million of them , sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second .
and the reason why that &apos;s happening is that , right now , in 2007 -- the technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously , side by side .
we didn &apos;t do this by actually writing code , like you do in a computer .
but when it &apos;s moving back and forth , the retina picks up these changes .
i &apos;m interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive , what we like to call &quot; supermassive &quot; black hole at the center of our galaxy .
so , now we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
and yet , what we actually see is light that can &apos;t be explained by the starlight .
this is the keck observatory . it hosts two telescopes with a mirror 10 meters , which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court .
you can see a lot of stars .
the young ones are blue . and the yellow ones , we don &apos;t know yet .
one day in new york , i was on the street and i saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants .
now the impulse to notate , or , more exactly i should say , encode music has been with us for a very long time .
mtt : this , of course , was the birth of opera , and its development put music on a radical new course .
people could now hear music all the time , even though it wasn &apos;t necessary for them to play an instrument , read music or even go to concerts .
and the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype .
and a fabulous man called miles loyd who lives on the outskirts of san francisco , wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the journal of energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity .
so really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people with these dreams . there are many of us .
so , for inspiration i listened to liszt and tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composers .
jennifer lin : yes , five cards . any five cards .
this kid is known online as lil demon .
that &apos;s important , but actually most people in the crowd occupy these other roles .
so , this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd-accelerated innovation .
if you take programmers , you know , the whole open-source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation .
there &apos;s a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
the world &apos;s ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide , and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine .
what if , in the coming crowd of nine billion ...
today , i see kibera in a different way .
now to be sure , the arab world is vast and varied .
but faiza didn &apos;t actually realize this , because there &apos;s so little sexuality education in schools , and so little communication in the family .
when your husband reaches out to you , when he seizes a part of your body , sigh deeply and look at him lustily .
now these efforts are small , they &apos;re often underfunded , and they face formidable opposition .
now , to make this more concrete , let &apos;s look at the list of top 10 words that statistically stick out in the most favorite tedtalks and in the least favorite tedtalks .
color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website .
okay , so what ? in fact , the so what is , in the brain , changes in neural activity , the things that make your brain work , the things that make your software work in your brain , are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow .
so this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs , that makes you freeze when you get parkinson &apos;s disease , that contributes to various forms of psychosis , is also redeployed to value interactions with other people and to assign value to gestures that you do when you &apos;re interacting with somebody else .
you &apos;re mad . that &apos;s an unfair offer , and you know what an unfair offer is .
early days , and we &apos;re just beginning , we &apos;re setting up sites around the world . here are a few of our collaborating sites .
and the really simple argument i want to make tonight , the really straightforward argument is this : that if we combine the right political philosophy , the right political thinking , with the incredible information revolution that has taken place , and that all of you know so much more about than i do , i think there &apos;s an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics , remake government , remake public services , and achieve what &apos;s up on that slide , which is a big increase in our well-being .
next part of the cold history lesson , the lovely picture of the british industrial revolution .
we &apos;re going to make every contract -- we &apos;re announcing this today -- available on the internet so anyone can see what the terms are , what the conditions are , driving huge value for money , but also huge increases , i believe , in well-being as well .
other examples are recycling .
i &apos;m talking about teachers .
they made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work .
to get started , we &apos;re doing a peer review day , okay ?
for example , i know some teachers aren &apos;t immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom .
putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they &apos;ve got the best idea of what their needs are .
then we like to take things apart .
so this stuff is just beginning .
why not personal biotech ?
today we can prevent the transmission of hiv .
shereen el-feki : it &apos;s not just a question of unfair or ineffective laws .
but for the first time in three decades into this epidemic we have a real chance to come to grips with hiv .
to begin , countries need to review their legislation as it touches hiv and vulnerable groups .
that &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
and increasingly , everything that people buy , every consumer product , in one way or another , can be personalized .
we actually did exactly the wrong thing in boston .
you have a dinner party . the table folds out to fit 16 people in otherwise a conventional one-bedroom , or maybe you want a dance studio .
we think ultimately all of this stuff can come together , a new model for mobility , a new model for housing , a new model for how we live and work , a path to market for advanced technologies , but in the end the main thing we need to focus on are people . cities are all about people .
they &apos;ve been around a long time , have been very important to coast communities .
on tory island , which is a strange place anyway , they were known as muldoons , and no one seems to know why .
these are archival tags .
so les noble in aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable really .
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t believe it .
and he was like , &quot; yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . later , later , later . &quot;
you want to learn as much as you can .
it was about children who were born with deformities , and their parents felt that once they were born with those deformities , they were not good enough to live in the society , so they were given some concoction to take and as a result they died .
so after collecting the money , when he left , we were waiting for him to bring the goods .
i mean , you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend -- and that &apos;s what i call proper , when four of us are on a manhole .
if you don &apos;t , you will end up losing your life .
the boxes are too narrow .
when a kid behaves like i did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
obviously i couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so i figured out a way where i could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
i challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
what i am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional .
and i had friends who were really good kids , who lived out the dr. jekyll mr. hyde scenario -- robert louis stevenson .
maybe it was the barrel that was bad .
this is the foundation of all of social science , the foundation of religion , the foundation of war .
the learner could be middle-aged , could be as young as 20 .
milgram &apos;s study is all about individual authority to control people .
so this anthropologist , john watson , found 23 cultures that had two bits of data .
those abuses went on for three months . who was watching the store ?
the good news is i married her the next year .
so i want to thank you . thank you . thank you .
that flow of mental images is mind .
we generate brain maps of the body &apos;s interior and use them as the reference for all other maps .
so throughout vertebrates , the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours , which is one of the reasons why i think those other species have conscious minds like we do .
thank you . thank you for hip-hop -- and anita hill .
now i tell you this -- i tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself , because i think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics , that beauty , that fun do matter .
we don &apos;t want one icon .
i wrote about emily apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do , but quickly learned , not only did she not like it , but she wasn &apos;t really good at it .
courtney martin : this isn &apos;t her mother &apos;s feminism
and eventually that vacation &apos;s got to come to an end .
by the way , feel free to check in on my head at any time .
in the game that we created , of course , you control the wooden form that &apos;s on the screen there with your mind .
imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight .
as i sat easel-side , watching her transform canvas after canvas , i learned that you could create your own world .
i &apos;m the eldest of three . i was born in 1971 .
but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face .
but before i got to him , i was so lost .
look where my belief had brought me to .
because i wasn &apos;t believing in me , really me , all the bits of me -- all the bits of all of us .
thank you .
you know some beatles factoid that dad didn &apos;t know .
and at first , it was very low .
but they were right . they were exactly right .
i &apos;m sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers , when we knew our friends &apos; phone numbers .
if , on the other hand , we need to look them all up , we may be in trouble .
people love that shared connection that gets created when somebody knows something about you .
no , every day we should be striving to learn something new .
and that &apos;s because having a son who &apos;s unemployed in manchester is really quite embarrassing , but having a son who &apos;s unemployed in thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment .
we merely have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model .
i &apos;m not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other .
and i think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy .
choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely tranformed .
the public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically , but it has to inform us where we are in our culture .
it wasn &apos;t pei and cobb , another firm designed this , but there &apos;s not enough prozac in the world to make people feel ok about going down this block .
and in fact , the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism , good buildings .
we can see some of the first ideas for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in america .
you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets .
&quot; that saturday when you wondered where i was , well , i was getting your ring .
matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they &apos;ve found , memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos .
i &apos;ll say bye for now .
and sometimes we make real plans .
so this is already evidence of how , in the academic literature , we will see a biased sample of the true picture of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted .
and i &apos;m a very nerdy doctor , so i read all of the studies that i could on this drug . i read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo , and i read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant , and because this patient hadn &apos;t done well on those other antidepressants , i thought , well , reboxetine is just as good . it &apos;s one to try .
now when the cochrane systematic reviewers were trying to collect together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether tamiflu actually did this or not , they found that several of those trials were unpublished .
the digital universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do -- our main space shows in the dome .
this is an image from saturday , photographed by the aqua satellite , but through the uniview software .
so , the model works , but it &apos;s only the tip of the iceberg , because my second idea is that it &apos;s not enough just to want to make music in something like guitar hero .
to get their hands on music , to shape it themselves , change it , to experiment with it , to make their own music .
and here &apos;s the great baritone james maddalena as he enters the system .
adam boulanger : yes . so , tod and i entered into a discussion following the tewksbury work and it was really about how dan is an expressive person , and he &apos;s an intelligent and creative person . and it &apos;s in his face , it &apos;s in his breathing , it &apos;s in his eyes . how come he can &apos;t perform one of his pieces of music ? that &apos;s our responsibility , and it doesn &apos;t make sense .
so that &apos;s the way he made his piece , and as adam says , we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece .
all right , untie me now and we &apos;ll get some dinner . &quot;
the other reason that it &apos;s difficult to resist temptation is because it &apos;s an unequal battle between the present self and the future self .
you &apos;re just telling yourself , &quot; without you , commitment device , i am nothing , i have no self-discipline . &quot;
and i &apos;ll show you some of these tools right here .
and what it is is an exploration into virtual reality .
there are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .
this is the letter sheen , and it makes the sound we think of as sh -- &quot; sh . &quot;
now when we do that , we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective .
the first is that we need to simplify the message that we &apos;re using , stripping away all the jargon that medicine has invented around itself .
biodiversity , the living fabric of this planet , is not a gas .
that &apos;s something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally .
but that doesn &apos;t help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place .
basically the stuff of life is natural capital , and we need to recognize and build that into our systems .
someone once asked me , &quot; who is better or worse , is it unilever or is it p &amp; amp ; g when it comes to their impact on rainforests in indonesia ? &quot;
thankfully , the flux , in other words , the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa , is more or less balanced .
every day , we use materials from the earth without thinking , for free . but what if we had to pay for their true value : would it make us more careful about what we use and what we waste ? think of pavan sukhdev as nature &apos;s banker -- assessing the value of the earth &apos;s assets . eye-opening charts will make you think differently about the cost of air , water , trees ...
he made me feel smart . he made me feel he was smart .
and the last time the rich guy invited us , he also invited a couple of philosophers .
dick , he was my friend . i did call him dick .
in fact , he had been convinced at one time that , to be a good physicist , that it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father .
and it sort of worked , but it didn &apos;t work very well .
this was more or less known .
this was the key to analyzing these experiments .
i literally drew on the walls of the trailer , mocked it up in cardboard , we &apos;d come in and cut , decide things were wrong , pull it out , put it back in .
and i walked in their prototype facility , and it &apos;s exactly like my shop , only bigger -- same tools , same things .
thing number one -- play with fire .
break the digital millennium copyright act .
we &apos;ve invaded every country we &apos;ve encountered .
and the rest of you have seen such children .
it &apos;s a real achievement to put that particular ability out , or to stifle it .
i don &apos;t want to be told on some scale my doctor invented in the car .
why would you drop out ?
it won &apos;t , and it never did .
you take an area , a school , a district , you change the conditions , give people a different sense of possibility , a different set of expectations , a broader range of opportunities , you cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners , you offer people the discretion to be creative and to innovate in what they do , and schools that were once bereft spring to life .
what if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature , or within our own stem cells ?
and we call that a &quot; gal stripping &quot; technique .
the astronauts each got to carry about ten silk flags in their personal kits .
and all throughout the library are different objects , different spaces .
and once we create new patterns in this brain , once we shape the brain in a new way , it never returns to its original shape .
before the light bulb was invented , people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it , focus it a little bit ; put lenses in front of it , focus it a little bit better .
i think it &apos;s wonderful ; i think sometimes people , when they get educated , lose it : they get so smart they &apos;re unwilling to look at things that they know better than .
all of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear .
looked up at the ceiling of my office one day -- i was working on a ground-penetrating radar project -- and my physicist ceo came in and said , &quot; we have a real problem .
our robot belongs to a family of robots called ballbots .
he &apos;s now keeping a constant distance to thomas .
but something weird happened .
so this requires figuring out how to get the most out of something &apos;s innate properties and also how to bend it to my will .
these are my valentines from 2005 and 2006 .
this year , i got , what i really have to say is a rather brilliant idea , to laser cut my valentines out of used christmas cards .
this abalone shell is a biocomposite material that &apos;s 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein .
and so that &apos;s what i would like be able to do -- convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table .
and i thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass .
but it &apos;s basically -- you can pull one out of a billion .
and they expect these people who work for them to do great work -- i would hope , at least .
it &apos;s like the front door of the office is like a cuisinart , and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits , because you have 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there , and then something else happens and you &apos;re pulled off your work , and you &apos;ve got to do something else , then you have 20 minutes , then it &apos;s lunch .
now , there are different kinds of distractions , but there aren &apos;t the really bad kinds of distractions that i &apos;ll talk about in just a minute .
it turns out that those aren &apos;t the things that are really distracting .
what if they &apos;re doing important work ?
but how about &quot; no-talk thursdays ? &quot;
just don &apos;t have it .
so this is interesting to us , because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual , emotional or functional value .
and this is fairly universally appreciated , it turns out , which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected .
but is , in fact , about the art of delegation .
you take a 10 or 20 percent commission , and then you -- the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission , and passes the rest over to you in cash .
and it &apos;s all about the social network of the knowledge , floating around .
when everyone &apos;s connected .
and if you &apos;ve ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting &quot; chicken , &quot; you &apos;re sitting there , looking at the person , waiting for them to look away , and then quickly checking the device .
another is to change our lifestyles .
and that &apos;s johnny depp &apos;s famous shoulder tattoo .
because the inability to experience regret is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics of sociopaths .
33 percent of all of our regrets pertain to decisions we made about education .
the second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment .
so for instance , here &apos;s one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life .
actually , you know what , i should warn you , you &apos;re going to be disappointed .
kathryn schulz : don &apos;t regret regret
they , businesses , other citizens &apos; groups , have enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings .
that children &apos;s medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year .
the person , in my view , who has done the best job of this in the health care area , of building a system in a very poor area , is dr. paul farmer , who , many of you know , has worked for now 20 years with his group , partners in health , primarily in haiti where he started , but they &apos;ve also worked in russia , in peru and other places around the world .
and not a single soul in this area was being treated for aids or tuberculosis .
we &apos;re undoing that now , and they are so over it and so into their future .
the teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard .
there &apos;s nowhere to flush .
it &apos;s becoming a green model .
the kids are from 25 countries .
when the architects came , they brought us these things , and you &apos;ve probably seen things like this .
this is alex , the best computer voice i &apos;ve been able to find , which comes as standard equipment on every macintosh .
there was a second surgery -- which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart .
how did i feel not being able to speak ?
when i read something , it will read in my voice .
in cosmological terms , that was about 10 minutes ago .
for billions of years , the universe evolved completely without notice .
it is human nature to look away from illness .
readers don &apos;t want to pay for yesterday &apos;s news , and advertisers follow them .
the front page became our signature .
same in poland : plus 13 , up to 35 percent raise of circulation after three years .
you can have no budgets , no people -- but still can put your work to the highest possible level .
i &apos;m actually going to share something with you i haven &apos;t talked about probably in more than 10 years .
i had so many surgeries to put my neck back together , to repair my heart a few times .
and then they had to figure out : &quot; well she needs furniture .
10 years later i gained my sight back .
but contained inside those documents was a new language , a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science -- namely symmetry .
and he referred me to this lovely quote from the japanese &quot; essays in idleness &quot; from the 14th century , in which the essayist wrote , &quot; in everything , uniformity is undesirable .
let &apos;s take the twisted six-pointed starfish .
let &apos;s see . let &apos;s do the third of the turn first , and then the sixth of a turn .
and we find the same symmetries here , and the same interaction .
anybody with five or less digits , you &apos;ve got to sit down , because you &apos;ve underestimated .
now let &apos;s advance to 10,000 years before the present .
now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century , we find a new style of technology .
it could benefit from tragedies .
it was the origin of the xerox copier , which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year .
i &apos;ve noticed something interesting about society and culture .
go space , space . it is totally amazing .
just type over it .
and once things are in a pile i can browse them by throwing them into a grid , or you know , flip through them like a book or i can lay them out like a deck of cards .
i might look successful and happy being in front of you today , but i once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair .
this is the hang seng index for hong kong .
and i said , &quot; how does that work ? &quot;
pragmatic chaos is , like all of netflix algorithms , trying to do the same thing .
it &apos;s because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation , like the buttons .
it &apos;s what the money motivates , that we &apos;re actually terraforming the earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency .
audience : shake . fold .
you use paper towels to dry your hands every day , but chances are , you &apos;re doing it wrong . in this enlightening and funny short talk , joe smith reveals the trick to perfect paper towel technique . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
well , at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars , that &apos;s 8.3 hours per day . the average wage in the u.s .
but you all are members of communities , and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows .
well , what &apos;s the history of this disease ?
those mosquitos are not infected .
well , all of us here , i &apos;ll bet , had some great teachers .
and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers , between , say , the top quartile -- the very best -- and the bottom quartile .
and we &apos;ve done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it , to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system .
but i &apos;m optimistic about this , i think there are some clear things we can do .
bill gates : mosquitos , malaria and education
he had to embrace this challenge , and i use that word intentionally . he didn &apos;t have to overcome dyslexia .
you know where this story goes .
it &apos;s more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it .
and i know this is cheesy , and i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m telling you this , but in that moment when everyone was laughing , i knew that i shouldn &apos;t quit .
our society loves to romanticize the idea of the single , solo inventor who , working late in the lab one night , makes an earthshaking discovery , and voila , overnight everything &apos;s changed .
we actually have to take samples from the surgical bed , what &apos;s left behind in the patient , and then send those bits to the pathology lab .
so they added two additional components .
women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes .
so it &apos;s very important to avoid inadvertent injury .
we &apos;ve been able to see every single nerve .
it is not a sprint .
if you look at the y-axis of this graph , you &apos;ll see that , in the mechanically ventilated air , you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen , or germ , than if you &apos;re outdoors .
and that &apos;s that all the sensations , feelings , decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain .
but electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance , which is where that phrase , in part , comes from .
so this is very powerful .
and now this next clip is just eight minutes later .
and because there &apos;s so many of these cells in the eye , potentially , they could be very high-resolution cameras .
right , yeah .
and it was a beautiful urban day , and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working .
there &apos;s some theoretical physicist at mit named steven johnson who has dropped two spots , i &apos;m happy to say .
i had no idea .
now , what &apos;s great about it is that people are working on -- within seconds of clay publishing this piece , people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing .
as a filmmaker , it worried me .
shortly after &quot; mr. smith &quot; became a filmclub classic , there was a week of all-night filibustering in the house of lords .
how has the world changed ? how could it be different ?
each a piece of memorable art , each a brick in the wall of who we are .
you &apos;re going it right now .
all right , now what i want you to do is to recite the last five letters of the english alphabet backwards .
we tend to remember about four things .
now we also need to repeat it . we need to practice .
the support may come in asking people questions , giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images , but we need to support it .
now , as guardians -- let &apos;s say the state , for example , which reserves the right to kill , the right to be duplicitous and so on -- the question we &apos;re asking the guardian at this point is are we meant , how are we meant , to secure local societies , create world peace and save the environment ?
this is a baby blanket by pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of alzheimer &apos;s later in life .
here &apos;s where i come from . i grew up in hong kong , with six million people in 40 square miles .
the book itself is a polymer . it is not a tree .
we call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition .
this is obviously a color photograph .
we studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air , fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day .
and if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by george orwell , george orwell was an optimist .
so the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this , well , the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations , there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations , saying that we knew all this already , we knew it was happening , there &apos;s nothing new here .
and every single one of these companies denies .
and the answer is , every single swedish business leader does that every single day .
but people are brutally honest with the internet , and when these leaks started , many people were asking me about this .
we should be angry , because this is wrong , and it &apos;s rude , and it should not be done .
it &apos;s keeping me standing . it &apos;s involved in coordinated movement .
and they &apos;re controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do .
and this is just showing this here -- this frozen tissue , and it &apos;s being cut .
they don &apos;t even have to log in to come use this tool , mine this data , find interesting things out with this .
most of you are probably familiar with genome-wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying , &quot; scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect x. &quot;
i &apos;ll just close by saying that the tools are there , and this is truly an unexplored , undiscovered continent .
we have no idea . we don &apos;t know what the counterfactual is .
do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage , or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them ?
after all , in this country as well , all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization .
make it easy and give a kilo of lentils , you multiply immunization rate by six .
and people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn &apos;t get a free one .
tell people the benefits of education , that &apos;s very cheap to do .
with deworming , you can get an extra year of education for three dollars .
fantastic tales , anecdotes from speakers .
i &apos;m sitting in cambridge , massachusetts at the healthcare development conference .
but the story of africa , and my focus , is beyond south africa because there &apos;s so much happening .
in tanzania last week , we had the launch of the east african organic produce standard .
why are they doing that ? because they expect investment to follow .
and if you compare light energy to musical scales , it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see , which is right in the middle ?
it &apos;s a gift that millions and millions in the world will never experience .
we had a nasa consultant who was actually an astronaut , who was actually on some of the missions , of apollo 15 , and he was there to basically double check my science .
so , when you saw my footage , you were seeing this : basically , a bunch of guys flipping a ship upside down , and the little mir subs are actually about the size of small footballs , and shot in smoke .
this isn &apos;t viewed outside of -- the next illustration is something that , there &apos;s like all one shot theory . it &apos;s a very elegant way of telling a story , especially if you &apos;re following somebody on a journey , and that journey basically tells something about their personality in a very concise way , and what we wanted to do based on the shot in &quot; goodfellas , &quot; which is one of the great shots ever , a martin scorsese film , of basically following henry hill through what it feels like to be a gangster walk going through the copacabana and being treated in a special way .
now , i was fascinated , but at the same time , skeptical .
kb : just don &apos;t break my concentration .
ok , a little bit closer .
allow your eyes to close , on five , four , three , two , one .
ok , it worked that time , excellent .
i want you to examine the shard of glass .
there you are , ok .
i &apos;ll put the blindfold on .
now , remember , you made all the decisions all along .
lord and lady rigor mortis were nibbling on the tarmac , and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running , and all the mummies went , &quot; run ! run chlamydia ! run ! &quot;
here we &apos;ve got a little bit of long-term memory , so , you know that night you want to forget , when you got really drunk ? bye-bye ! gone .
thank you .
one of them told me , &quot; paul , that is the world &apos;s stupidist idea .
if you &apos;re so virtuous , show me the money .
but wait . what &apos;s wrong with this experiment ?
now this idea is not new .
again he asked me , &quot; what do you think we should do ? &quot;
and men have 10 times the testosterone as women , so men do this more than women -- we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally .
and one of these guys , he must have been 22 , he had 150 percent spike in oxytocin .
thank you .
it &apos;s not broken . it &apos;s wonderfully constructed .
about eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse .
i gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer , and i said , &quot; keep talking into it until it types what you say . &quot;
so i tested them .
could it be -- a devastating question , a question that was framed for me by nicholas negroponte -- could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete ?
&quot; shhh . &quot;
there was a time when stone age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say , &quot; what are those twinkling lights ? &quot;
you can do self-organized learning environments at home , in the school , outside of school , in clubs .
so basically , with both of your hands you &apos;re controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you &apos;re doing separate notes , when really it &apos;s continuously going ...
this is shivdutt yadav , and he &apos;s from uttar pradesh , india .
a bloodline is determined and ordered .
haigh &apos;s chocolate , in collaboration with the foundation for rabbit-free australia , stopped all production of the easter bunny in chocolate and has replaced it with the easter bilby .
these are the descendants of hans frank who was hitler &apos;s personal legal advisor and governor general of occupied poland .
in a 12-month period when i was at the orphanage , only one child had been adopted .
of course , my job is all about listening , and my aim , really , is to teach the world to listen .
if i just simply let go and allow my hand , my arm , to be more of a support system , suddenly i have more dynamic with less effort . much more .
i say &quot; music , &quot; but actually i mean &quot; sound . &quot;
if we see someone in a wheelchair , we assume they cannot walk .
however , not one of you got out of your seats to think , &quot; right ! how can i clap ? ok , maybe ...
you know . i need to say something .
that format of forum , at that time , was not well-known outside of japan .
i didn &apos;t instruct them to do it ; they just decided that that &apos;s what they wanted .
got a couple questions for you .
love and peace were mentioned .
cp : that &apos;s a good question .
so there &apos;s lessons to learn , and there &apos;s lessons to learn from the exception , the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we &apos;ve made , and many other scholars have made around the world .
i &apos;ve been to some of those continents , but africa was , in the words of steven pinker , was a blank slate , largely .
it &apos;s only been with us for less than a century , and in that time , that fourth dimension , when radioactive dating came about , less than a century ago , and we could actually tell how old some of these things were , is probably the most profound transformation , because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically .
... as long as their boat .
anyway , you find other things , too .
the best way to test this is to actually create a model .
it takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs .
paul sereno : digging up dinosaurs
she loses the check , but she goes home with something bigger and more important .
in other words , early humans are eating dead animals -- no argument , that &apos;s a fact .
the third mystery is this : at the university of utah , they started tracking finishing times for people running the marathon .
they need to be part of the pack .
i didn &apos;t do yoga . i &apos;m not ready . &quot;
and so that year , i started to build this robot , kismet , the world &apos;s first social robot .
we can &apos;t carefully control them because they &apos;re subconscious for us .
i could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays with their granddaughters , with their friends , and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house , like sharing a bedtime story .
so the first thing i want to look at is how long , how long did people interact with these systems .
i really want to come up with new ways of children &apos;s media that foster creativity and learning and innovation .
i &apos;m ready and willing . i &apos;m packing my gun .
you don &apos;t read other people &apos;s poetry , and you don &apos;t got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration . &quot;
you think black entertainers have it hard finding work in this business ? i &apos;m a suspicious mulatto , which means i &apos;m too black to be white and too white to be doing it right .
so , the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism ; what you can &apos;t have , you want more .
how they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing , and how that should happen .
when you take the logo off , you &apos;re opening up the interpretations and making the work inconclusive , opposed to conclusive when you are advertising .
i &apos;ve also been working with the guardian on a topical basis -- a page a week in their newspaper -- which has been very interesting , working topically .
it then categorizes and organizes all that information , associates it with everything in the past we &apos;ve ever learned , and projects into the future all of our possibilities .
but then i immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness -- and i affectionately refer to this space as la la land .
i &apos;m thinking , &quot; oh my gosh , i sound like a golden retriever . &quot;
streets are some of the most valuable resources that a city has , and yet it &apos;s an asset that &apos;s largely hidden in plain sight .
it was chaotic .
this is in front of macy &apos;s , and they were a big supporter of this new approach , because they understood that more people on foot is better for business .
bike volumes have spiked .
it &apos;s diverse -- young , old , black , white , women , kids , all getting on a bike .
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the west .
we cannot make the mistakes we &apos;ve made with malaria and hiv .
what we have done is to show that high-quality health care , comparable to the best anywhere in the world , can be done in a developing country environment .
we will be doing the west african heart institute in port harcourt , nigeria . that project will be starting within the next few months . we hope to open in 2008-09 .
we recommend exercise as the most effective , simple , easy thing to do .
because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging and all that kind of stuff . in the process , i want you to just hear from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them .
i mean , einstein and mozart and tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today .
ok , there is my childhood church , that &apos;s specific . there &apos;s some more , fort collins .
you &apos;ll see these different kinds of minds .
yeah , i &apos;m a million-mile flyer .
ok , my science teacher got me studying because i was a goofball that didn &apos;t want to study .
because what i &apos;m observing is the good teachers , for a lot of these kids , are out in the community colleges , but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
tg : i &apos;m passionate about that the things i do are going to make the world a better place .
it &apos;s an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system , or a digital storytelling tool .
the team is proud of our four attempts .
and as we &apos;re looking out , kind of a surreal moment before the first stroke , standing on the rocks at marina hemingway , the cuban flag is flying above , all my team &apos;s out in their boats , hands up in the air , &quot; we &apos;re here , we &apos;re here for you , &quot; bonnie and i look at each other , and we say , this year , the mantra is -- and i &apos;ve been using it in training -- find a way .
you have no idea how many 15-hour training swims i had done .
the second is , &quot; you can chase your dreams at any age ; you &apos;re never too old . &quot;
well , we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home .
he doesn &apos;t have that community anymore .
thank you for reading . goodbye . &quot;
we are a pro-printing press society .
and when people draw diagrams of version control systems , the diagrams always look something like this .
and you don &apos;t have to understand what the circles and boxes and arrows mean to see that this is a far more complicated way of working than is supported by ordinary version control systems .
right .
t.s. eliot once said , &quot; one of the most momentous things that can happen to a culture is that they acquire a new form of prose . &quot;
being able to treat sound as an instrument , and be able to dig for more abstract sounds and things to play live , mixing electronics and acoustics .
if you were there you wouldn &apos;t do it yourself .
rob grover : friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft , and we use the friction when it &apos;s flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down .
we saw geysers coming out .
we needed to change our schedule .
this short video is from last week .
we spend most of our money on the last 20 percent of life .
and we &apos;re layering multiple technologies -- pet scans , ct scans and molecular diagnostics -- to find and to seek things at different levels .
but now that we &apos;re switching to merging medical data , making it available electronically , we can crowd source that information , and now as a physician , i can access my patients &apos; data from wherever i am just through my mobile device .
i can measure my steps , my caloric outtake .
still in clinical trials , but imagine when we can connect these , for example , to the amazing bionic limb , such as the deka arm built by dean kamen and colleagues , which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who &apos;s lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they &apos;ve had in the past .
or for those of us who are sighted , how about having the assisted-living contact lens ?
i might want to watch how much dessert i have at the lunch break for example .
so we &apos;re attacking the wrong target .
because i know as a doctor , if someone comes to me with stage i disease , i &apos;m thrilled -- we can often cure them .
this is called &quot; the dress . &quot;
a man shouting , &quot; shut up ! &quot; the dogs frantically snarling , claws scrabbling , then her -- her voice hoarse , harsh , hollow , almost only a tone , incoherent , a note , a squawk , bone on metal , metal gone molten , calling them back , &quot; come back darlings , come back dear ones .
and that brought back to me the stable i worked on weekends when i was 12 , and a splendid piebald stallion , who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that , though more hugely of course , enormous , gleaming , resplendent .
the title is &quot; this happened . &quot;
because there were images in it he said were licentious .
how she incarnates our desperate human need for regard , our passion to live in beauty , to be beauty , to be cherished by glances , if by no more , of something like love , or love .
there &apos;s another kind of crucifixion .
after all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world , there &apos;s one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still , much more than the others .
we were trying to ski from this group of islands up here , severnaya zemlya , to the north pole .
the lesson is : don &apos;t even try . &quot;
it was a lack of ice -- open water .
i took a photo of that . sat down on my sledge . did a sort of video diary piece .
so i thought , i &apos;ve got to compose myself for troy .
for me , this is about exploring human limits , about exploring the limits of physiology , of psychology and of technology . they &apos;re the things that excite me .
and what &apos;s the brilliant idea he had ?
but let me give you a different perspective on the same story .
i mean , this is all very depressing , right -- people have conflicts of interest , we don &apos;t see it , and so on .
when i was a child , i lived in california , which is , you know , mostly a very nice place to live , but for me as a child , california could also be a little scary .
it &apos;s a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do .
i read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs , and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called &quot; productive paranoia , &quot; which meant that these people , instead of dismissing their fears , these people read them closely , they studied them , and then they translated that fear into preparation and action .
and maybe if we all tried to read our fears , we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them .
indeed , this was , i think , best said by marie curie who said that one never notices what has been done but only what remains to be done .
so i think the puzzle model doesn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s what makes a good question .
they work differently than our visual systems in some cases , but nonetheless we &apos;ve been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system .
they &apos;re interested .
stuart firestein : the pursuit of ignorance
over a few days , the tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies , billions of dollars in maintaining , trying to maintain , its prisons , collapsed , disappeared , because of the voices of the public .
this is the right moment , and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region .
let us not repeat the mistake of iran , of &#91; the &#93; mosaddeq revolution .
in my opinion , these people are much more wiser than , not only the political elite , even the intellectual elite , even opposition leaders including political parties .
wonderful .
&quot; no , no . we share needles because we don &apos;t want to go to jail . &quot;
now let &apos;s talk about sex .
what &apos;s rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it &apos;s really bad for business to have another sti .
it means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population -- more people living longer , healthier lives , more likely to be getting laid with hiv -- is outweighing the effects of lower viral load , and that &apos;s a very worrisome thing .
it &apos;s going to be really hard for us to individually affect what &apos;s rational for every frankie and every ines out there , but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread hiv .
she got mad ; i took a licking .
those last few pictures were of ray hicks , who just passed away last year .
you boys make me so mad . you &apos;re going to get a job this summer . &quot;
i &apos;m 57 ; still have the check .
don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
and i think i learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief , just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in .
oh , i think i &apos;ve got time to tell you about this . my dad was an inventor .
they said they were going to beat us up if we didn &apos;t make some gunpowder for them .
folk musician and storyteller david holt plays the banjo and shares photographs and old wisdom from the appalachian mountains . he also demonstrates some unusual instruments like the mouth bow -- and a surprising electric drum kit he calls &quot; thunderwear . &quot;
and the idea is that everything is defined .
so this is general relativity , this is quantum theory .
now , if you think about democracy from this perspective , a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests , many different agendas , many different individuals , many different points of view .
in a career i &apos;m definitely more engaged .
many of you will know this tedster , danny gilbert , whose book , actually , i got it through the ted book club .
and i very quickly made a list of the things i was interested in , put them in a hierarchy , divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan , very much like in grade school .
or there &apos;s a smaller contemporary orchestra , 12 people that remixes its own title .
it &apos;s a movie about happiness .
so these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals -- pigs , chickens and , most importantly , water buffalo -- that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased .
and it &apos;s also a moment of self-awareness .
if we could expand our definition of death to encompass life , we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear .
emmanuel ? absolutely .
and she said , you know , she &apos;s 90 . she &apos;s running out of time , she said .
that reminds me , i must post that letter . &quot;
it &apos;s certainly something he can relate to .
i &apos;m right-handed but i seem to have smudged that ink as well . &quot;
and you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen . right ?
&quot; make this world a better place , if you can .
i hope you all realize that .
and it &apos;s kind of cool -- if you look at the cassowary , or any of the birds that have crests on their heads , they actually grow to about 80 percent adult size before the crest starts to grow .
in north america in the northern plains of the united states and the southern plains of alberta and saskatchewan , there &apos;s this unit of rock called the hell creek formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on earth .
because , well we know why .
it &apos;s a big skull .
so again , real easy to say that tyrannosaurus ontogeny included nanotyrannus , and therefore we can take out another dinosaur .
so , this is just in construction , and there &apos;s a tensegrity structure .
so in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , we were mostly known for independent work , such as installation artist , architect , commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations .
so eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned , opening views from gallery to gallery .
so , it &apos;s already sticking out into space enough , and then from that is this , is this small area called the mediatheque .
one thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall .
i joined 10 years ago because i wanted female role models , and i was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession , and what that meant for our image in the media .
we try to give a good picture of reality .
pam from the office .
now , i don &apos;t know if one of the editors was a woman , but that can make the biggest differences .
my doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70 percent , and it was killing me .
and thank you for listening .
but still , there were all kinds of questions about -- &quot; did you wear a hat ? &quot; &quot; how short was your skirt ? &quot;
i think that they thought that it was a soft issue .
more men who believe that the balance is best ?
crowds are gathered in tahrir square .
and this great news gives birth to even more great news , because the historic trend is this .
makes us look really young .
look , once you have these tools , you can &apos;t not use them .
they ask if it should have reproduction in it , or metabolism , or evolution .
one of them is craig venter &apos;s question .
it feels the dna origami .
you can use dna origami for that .
what it &apos;s really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light , asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things . thank you .
but it &apos;s still a big issue in brazil .
the service responded effectively and efficiently , during the unfortunate 26 / 11 mumbai terror attacks .
such a service simply do not exist .
some people actually come back and say , &quot; oh , you want to screw me . let me show you what i can do . &quot;
and we call that the meme-ome .
and they &apos;re looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion .
we could go the other direction and say , well , what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields .
social lines are barbed wire .
the janitor &apos;s job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital .
a dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a detroit tigers game at the ballpark .
it &apos;s preposterous on its face .
right ?
we see this in medicine .
and a bonus he &apos;s discovering is he &apos;s actually going to make even more money .
they need to learn to respect their schoolmates .
and it turns out that with 60 minutes cameras rolling in the background , after he pretty much made his position clear on this -- he had his hook and he had his -- he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that , quote -- his quote -- it &apos;s the first time he &apos;s felt like he &apos;s had an arm in 39 years .
so , they finished that . and i , as you can tell , am a bashful guy .
i then thought it would be years before we &apos;d be able to make it really , really useful .
i hadn &apos;t dealt with this kind of problem or frankly , this whole segment of the medical world .
so , he wouldn &apos;t say much .
he had one good eye .
it &apos;s not possible . it would be nice but let &apos;s be realistic .
soldiers who &apos;ve lost limbs in service face a daily struggle unimaginable to most of us . at tedmed , dean kamen talks about the profound people and stories that motivated his work to give parts of their lives back with his design for a remarkable prosthetic arm .
&quot; i know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here .
it was , for me , one of the most difficult things i &apos;d ever done , but it was also the most beautiful .
then i actually started thinking about liquid breathing .
and you &apos;re really ridding your body of co2 .
i decided that i was going to break the world record live on prime-time television .
my brother had a picture of it . it is really ...
i spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down .
i was like &quot; what ? &quot;
but we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in .
it &apos;s just cash .
is the country gonna make it ?
i mean , i really can &apos;t believe how lucky i am here , standing in front of you , speaking .
look , there &apos;s a very little known fact : countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars don &apos;t produce drugs .
you know , the aid system , at first , was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries , not to generate growth in the poor countries .
they couldn &apos;t all be on stage , but we &apos;re going to bring their aura to the stage , so here they are .
mm : okay . so , i &apos;m told we &apos;re ready , which means we can now point at the image , and there you all are .
it will cause rising seas . it will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands .
we are facing an unprecedented number , scale of disasters .
global warming is something that happens to all of us , all at once .
certainly , nothing can give you more optimism than that .
pharaoh ramses the fifth , whose picture is here , died of smallpox .
the way we organize is based on two pillars .
otherwise when you bring the car to the garage to fix the light , if you have to remove the engine to access the lights , the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours , and the warranty budget will explode .
so who is left ? the employees , who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation .
to deal with complexity , to enhance a novel system , we have created what we call the smart simplicity approach based on simple rules .
you need also to increase reciprocity , by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient .
thank you .
i think they said it tasted like chicken .
there is no area of the government -- not the epa or the fda -- that controls genetically-engineered pets .
and what they &apos;ve done here is they &apos;ve put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top , and it &apos;s on a big computer tracking ball .
and eventually she was moving it and moving it , and eventually stopped moving her right arm and , staring at the screen , could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves -- which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms .
it &apos;s already happening . it &apos;s not science fiction .
if only darwin had nasa .
so melanin was recruited , in our lineage , and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in africa , to be a natural sunscreen .
between 1520 and 1867 , 12 million , 500 people were moved from high uv to low uv areas in the transatlantic slave trade .
and he resembles , very closely , people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern africa , or southeast asia .
thank you very much .
it was 1.48 .
it used to be very time-consuming , but now it &apos;s nothing .
the seer of clouds had to take account of it .
this is a mess , mess , mess , brownian loop .
it was very easy , and you can write many books very fast about it .
but then the computer came , and i decided to apply the computer , not to new problems in mathematics -- like this wiggle wiggle , that &apos;s a new problem -- but to old problems .
this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics .
now comes the between-subjects design , the ab design , the ab testing .
you know the feedback , whether you &apos;re solving the puzzles or not .
happiness is the freedom of choice .
over two decades ago , the world insisted to africa that markets must be liberalized , that economies must be structurally adjusted .
to give you an example , between 2001 and 2002 , ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest .
and in fact , would even dump the grain in lake michigan , rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms .
so , in fact , our proclamation is going to parliament next month .
so , we are in the business of finding our happiness .
the name means &quot; edge of the desert . &quot;
and a good way of doing that , the most efficient way , is to use some kind of sand catcher .
here i am , playing the part of the mad scientist , working with the bugs at ucl in london , trying to solidify them .
borges said that &quot; nothing is built on stone , everything is built on sand , but we must build as if the sand were stone . &quot;
then contributors from all over the world began showing up , prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits .
forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet .
but we know how to fix this .
they &apos;re genocidal inmates , most of them , and they &apos;re stirring the contents of their own latrines , because if you put poop in a sealed environment , in a tank , pretty much like a stomach , then , pretty much like a stomach , it gives off gas , and you can cook with it .
she was scared of snakes . she was scared of rape .
people go out and upgrade their toilet .
and we published a paper in science , the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane .
it &apos;s not just the fish , though , that are disappearing .
so , what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish , as you see on the left in front of you .
and the algae give the corals sugar , and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection .
you all know this story .
for it is given in certain ufo-ology or ufology circles , that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia ; that they have walked among us in disguise , observing us , guiding our evolution from ape to man -- if you believe in that sort of thing -- and , occasionally , kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids .
i did not know why they were teasing me .
that &apos;s when she turned to me and said , &quot; are you looking forward to seeing the movie ? &quot;
and the way i remember it , the movie featured these details .
she was smiling .
john hodgman : aliens , love -- where are they ?
but shouldn &apos;t we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement ?
it was above the gdp for three years in a row just before the crisis .
but actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me , because it suddenly became clear to me why we don &apos;t do the blindingly obvious things .
internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search .
and it &apos;s also clear that we will never achieve that unless we &apos;re capable of redefining a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations , a prosperity that is more meaningful and less materialistic than the growth-based model .
but it has to have political leadership .
i also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale .
alexa meade : your body is my canvas
it spreads out to be really thin , so you have a hard time corralling it .
&quot; now , &quot; you think , &quot; why would something so lame work on people so smart ? &quot;
there were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them . &quot;
the only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices .
it doesn &apos;t have the same resonance for us that the arctic national wildlife refuge has , but it should , i mean , it &apos;s a bird sanctuary .
it &apos;s called strong , which is &quot; secure transportation reducing oil needs gradually , &quot; and the idea is instead of being helpless , we need to be more strong .
right ? a lot of men hear the term &quot; women &apos;s issues &quot; and we tend to tune it out , and we think , &quot; hey , i &apos;m a guy . that &apos;s for the girls , &quot; or &quot; that &apos;s for the women . &quot;
and now a whole lot has happened in one sentence .
what &apos;s going on ? why do so many men abuse , physically , emotionally , verbally , and other ways , the women and girls , and the men and boys , that they claim to love ? what &apos;s going on with men ?
now , i understand that a lot of women who have been trying to speaking out about these issues , today and yesterday and for years and years , often get shouted down for their efforts .
i &apos;m using the gender binary . i know there &apos;s more than men and women , there &apos;s more than male and female .
now , it &apos;s easier said than done , because i &apos;m saying it now , but i &apos;m telling you it &apos;s not easy in male culture for guys to challenge each other , which is one of the reasons why part of the paradigm shift that has to happen is not just understanding these issues as men &apos;s issues , but they &apos;re also leadership issues for men .
that &apos;s a failure , in most cases , of men &apos;s leadership .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re all avid &quot; american idol &quot; watchers .
but , once she started to win , then they got behind her again .
anyway , last year , i heard about the himalayas and the melting of the -- and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change .
instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
so that &apos;s essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches .
so we start with white , blue , blue , white .
this is three minutes of uv light .
but it &apos;s definitely an interesting new worldview .
so if we &apos;re seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet , we need to look somewhere else for the solution .
some of it is about walking . it &apos;s not all perfect yet .
and if we &apos;re going to really , truly become sustainable cities , we need to think a little differently .
you can find four or five passages in the bible of this ilk .
also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy , in failed states , collapsed empires , frontier regions , mafias , street gangs and so on .
which is why , in part , donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost .
amy lockwood : selling condoms in the congo
and we had one set of countries up there which was the western world .
and united states only had some , one , two thousand dollars at that time .
the last chapter is about present , and president obama , and the other is about the past , where you cover everything from washington to eisenhower .
now all your different departments .
and it is the dhs that makes it possible to know this .
okay . i give you singapore , the year i was born .
don &apos;t make it africa . don &apos;t make it a race issue .
now , when the ted people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk -- -- that was before the cartoon of muhammad had triggered global rioting .
i &apos;m sorry -- it was a cheap laugh , but i wanted to find a way to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse , and i thought that might do it .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily predict a win-win outcome .
so let &apos;s call it the death spiral of negativity .
to really understand it , you &apos;ve got to say , &quot; oh , i get it .
when i was president of the american psychological association , they tried to media-train me , and an encounter i had with cnn summarizes what i &apos;m going to be talking about today , which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic .
and now , 14 of the disorders are treatable , two of them actually curable .
you can ask , how do you stack up for positive emotion , for meaning , for flow , against literally tens of thousands of other people ?
but the pleasant life has three drawbacks , and it &apos;s why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn &apos;t end here .
you &apos;re one with the music . time stops .
i &apos;d like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction , and who you never properly thanked .
i &apos;ve never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much , which was one of the remarkable things .
unfortunately , i personally do not believe in the marshall plan .
it should be a challenge of creating wealth .
the ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity .
the productive margin in our governments &apos; search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy , it lies with international donors .
the military , 380 billion .
pygmies in the drc , by randy olson .
i remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me . &quot;
nick , along with researcher dr. michael fay , collared the matriarch of the herd .
and brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never-before-made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom .
but then paul got in the water .
but i have changed my mind about stress , and today , i want to change yours .
you &apos;re going to do this out loud as fast as you can , starting with 996 .
now i said i have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from , so we are going to do one more intervention .
but my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart .
it seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone &apos;s life expectancy .
we believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this .
we &apos;re modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake .
these are places that do have road infrastructure , but it &apos;s very inefficient .
we shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds .
we specialize in high-quality facial animation for video games and films .
for three times , i applied to biomedical science , to be a doctor .
on their way , they looted everything .
and fortunately , i saved his life .
i say , &quot; no way , you are not going to do it here . &quot;
this is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this .
that &apos;s because of the language of guns .
first place i &apos;d like to take you is what many believe will be the world &apos;s deepest natural abyss .
along that same line , i have to tell you that with the spate of hollywood movies that came out last year , we have never seen monsters underground -- at least the kind that eat you .
it was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects .
there are two primary targets we &apos;re doing here .
one of them is the requirement for economical earth-to-space transport .
we have to beat that .
that &apos;s not true .
they call them fast track or vip tickets .
in new york , in chicago , in washington , d.c. , they &apos;ve tried this , offering 50 dollars for an a , 35 dollars for a b .
all right . what &apos;s emerged from this discussion is the following question : will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation , the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey , which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sakes ?
our children go to different schools .
and here &apos;s my theme : because of the headwinds , if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last 150 years , growth is cut in half .
now hours per person are shrinking , first because of the retirement of the baby boomers , and second because there &apos;s been a very significant dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution .
electricity was also very helpful in liberating women .
urban environments make people more productive than on the farm .
and i &apos;m gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within , and to follow the ted commandments : that is , actually , something that creates a near-death experience , but near-death is good for creativity .
my father was a baptist minister , and he believed in miracles , and that god &apos;s will would take care of that .
and there &apos;s the terrible and dreaded observer effect , in which you &apos;re looking for something , and you know , things are happening simultaneously , and you &apos;re looking at it in a different way , and you &apos;re trying to really look for the about-ness , or what is this story about . and if you try too hard , then you will only write the about .
i saw examples of that . once i identified this question , it was all over the place .
in writing a story , it is the place where i begin .
i had so many examples -- i have so many instances like this , when i &apos;m writing a story , and i cannot explain it .
but i go back to this question of , how do i create something out of nothing ?
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread , no one wanted it .
and i ignored every message because i don &apos;t have a pain reliever problem .
i could do that again if you want it .
they didn &apos;t want to buy his bread . it didn &apos;t look like &quot; french bread . &quot;
krispy kreme has a strategy , and what they do is , they enter a city , they talk to the people with otaku , and then they spread through the city to the people who &apos;ve just crossed the street .
oh , you like my ring ? it &apos;s my grandmother .
so what you need to do is figure out who does care .
one month after mubarak stepped down , this was his reward .
this is the u.n. &apos; s population data , you may have seen , for the world .
and after even 30 years of doing this , after 30 years of exploring the ocean , i never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that i have while i &apos;m at sea .
and with that , i saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems .
so this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner , maybe seven or eight shrimp and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process .
but it &apos;s an animal that &apos;s about 98 percent in decline throughout most of its range .
but , you know , thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate , and the species &apos; future is in great danger .
and i wanted to close this program with a story of hope , a story i did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing , the global fish crisis story .
there was a very sick orangutan baby , my first encounter .
there was a huge amount of crime .
and then we apply all these other principles like transparency , professional management , measurable results , scalability , &#91; unclear &#93; , etc .
april .
and if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil , and we were actually monitoring , measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares , 5,000 acres .
and that &apos;s green . if you look from the tower -- this is when we start attacking the grass .
so you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate , and you have the trees to initiate the rain .
but whatever you do in that program , it has to be fully supported by the people , meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local , cultural values .
do you see how there &apos;s three peaks to the yellow sine wave ?
i have a two-year-old daughter who &apos;s the best thing ever .
reuben margolin : sculpting waves in wood and time
and every city has its own design .
what i &apos;m trying to say is , i &apos;m not trying to prove which system of transport is better .
and every part can be transformed ; every frog can be transformed in a prince .
and then , even when they &apos;re not saying appalling things and they &apos;re really trying to do serious research , well , it &apos;s been slow . progress has been slow .
so consciousness is an illusion .
and this , if you &apos;ve ever had a philosophy course , this is known as the famous mind-body problem .
okay . another feature of consciousness is that it comes in unified conscious fields .
now that argument , i made that argument 30 -- oh my god , i don &apos;t want to think about it — more than 30 years ago , but there &apos;s a deeper argument implicit in what i &apos;ve told you , and i want to tell you that argument briefly , and that is , consciousness creates an observer-independent reality .
okay , i promised to refute all these guys , and i don &apos;t have an awful lot of time left , but let me refute a couple more of them .
but this is a crisis of , not natural resources -- though i believe that &apos;s true -- but a crisis of human resources .
reform is no use anymore , because that &apos;s simply improving a broken model .
so let me ask you something you may take for granted .
i don &apos;t mean you shouldn &apos;t go to college , but not everybody needs to go and not everybody needs to go now .
it doesn &apos;t .
but it &apos;s not only about that .
i wanted to read you a quick , very short poem from w. b. yeats , who some of you may know .
but some verbs are irregular .
thank you very much .
and what i &apos;ve discovered since is this : bullies use violence in three ways .
and if it grows very big it probably happens .
and they &apos;re doing what they think is best .
and complete silence fell .
and this open-heartedness is exactly what i &apos;ve experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since i got here yesterday .
so , imagine we &apos;re in the middle of america .
it &apos;s called &quot; learning to see &quot; because it &apos;s about an object that hopefully works reflexively and talks about that vision or connection with the darkness of the body that i see as a space of potential .
here is a box filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure , with a cloud and with very bright light .
and thanks to the people of interface , i have become a recovering plunderer .
in the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
a better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
and as my good friend and adviser amory lovins says , &quot; if something exists , it must be possible . &quot;
the continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself .
but as particular as they feel to us , we know we &apos;re not alone .
you see them on youtube , in dance competitions , film festivals and more .
thank you , and godspeed .
and mr. ross said , &quot; you &apos;re too smart to die and i don &apos;t want it on my conscience , so i &apos;m leaving this school and i &apos;m taking you with me . &quot;
he &apos;s making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people .
that &apos;s puff pastry day . why ?
that &apos;s our library with more handcrafted furniture .
i wanted you to see this gallery because it &apos;s as good as it gets .
then a bass player named ray brown , and a fellow named stanley turrentine , and a piano player named herbie hancock , and a band called the count basie orchestra , and a fellow named tito puente , and a guy named gary burton , and shirley horn , and betty carter , and dakota staton and nancy wilson all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city .
and we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states .
he came up to me afterwards , he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and if that &apos;s not true , how did i get here ? &quot;
and the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain , and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code . and when i say code , i do literally mean code .
now i just want to wrap up , and as i was mentioning earlier of course i have a lot of other data if you &apos;re interested , but i just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in its language , and the potential power of being able to do that .
this bacterium has the special property that it makes light , so it makes bioluminescence , like fireflies make light .
the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria .
it gets in , it starts growing , it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules .
that &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the lecture .
aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players .
and how many say , no , he doesn &apos;t ?
all right , who has an answer for charlie ?
and the supreme court justices wrestled with that question .
after all , there &apos;s no running or jumping , and the ball stands still .
from flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage -- that was a genius link .
now , i want to ask a question .
you know , if you haven &apos;t got an argument that &apos;s that strong , then just don &apos;t waste my time , is what i say .
and there are really two games in town , according to most people , with regard to postponing aging .
we can think , really , that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like .
i have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology , the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life , starting before we &apos;re born .
the answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone , too .
so , why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality , when it is so advantageous , or is evolution just incomplete ?
it actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on ebay .
so we like to see profits , plus positive social and environmental benefits , when we invest .
and at one of the campaign sessions , she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn &apos;t become president -- she was a woman , and even half a woman .
and in fact , these are many of the half-vacant communities that you see today .
according to the center for disease control , fully one third of all children born after 2000 will get diabetes .
and then finally , in terms of driving , there &apos;s the issue of the single-largest killer of healthy adults , and one of the largest killers of all people , is car crashes .
if you look at any carbon map , because we map it per square mile , any carbon map of the u.s. , it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the u.s. , hottest in the cities , cooler in the suburbs , dark , peaceful in the countryside .
and it &apos;s very interesting to see that the highest-ranking american city , honolulu , number 28 , is followed by kind of the usual suspects of seattle and boston and all walkable cities .
we think that &apos;s probably what got this frog , and humans are spreading this fungus .
we used ultraviolet radiation to do that .
but it &apos;s also a tragic history .
that guy is going to eat all our sheep .
so we went back to these specimens and we started digging around , and particularly we looked into the teeth of skulls , hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers , and we found much better quality dna .
if the only nuclear dna that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine dna , that &apos;s the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil .
is that all we would do ? and this is an interesting question .
and the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on .
one of the things we asked them recently was what &apos;s their top issue .
it is all the resources that were taken from africa , including human , that built these countries today !
now i put my sister on my back -- burning -- and i walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back .
these are people who are productive agents in the economy .
we also have private citizens now who have a lot of money -- some of them in this audience , with private foundations .
each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best .
in fact , the chinese minister of finance said to me , when i asked him what are we doing wrong in nigeria .
but i want you to realize that resources in the hands of african women is a powerful tool .
and most of our audience was representative of the 82 percent african-american population in the city at that time .
now , there &apos;s a third wave of migration happening in detroit : a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs .
i &apos;ve done most of this work at johns hopkins university , but also at the national institute of health where i was previously .
when an area of the brain is active , meaning a neural area is active , it gets blood flow shunted to that area .
and i &apos;ve listened to that solo 200 times , and i still like it .
he &apos;s in there . you can see his legs up there .
this is the control condition . this is what they memorized .
musician and researcher charles limb wondered how the brain works during musical improvisation -- so he put jazz musicians and rappers in an fmri to find out . what he and his team found has deep implications for our understanding of creativity of all kinds . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
someone always asks the math teacher , &quot; am i going to use calculus in real life ? &quot; and for most of us , says arthur benjamin , the answer is no . he offers a bold proposal on how to make math education relevant in the digital age .
it doesn &apos;t require any scalp preparation , no conductive gel or paste .
so let &apos;s see if evan can actually try and imagine pulling .
and moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world , with robots and simple machines , for example -- in this case , flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking &quot; lift &quot; with your mind .
we &apos;ve got a different solution .
that &apos;s great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they don &apos;t have health care systems .
so this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond .
you then have to introduce the mosquitoes , and you have to model that and how they come and go .
what if we could do that ?
eric johanson : what we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage .
i want to take something rather humble to discuss .
this is powered by wind . all of the lights are daylight bulbs .
three compost bins -- go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week -- really good , makes fantastic compost .
very advanced , no air-conditioning -- i love it .
if we don &apos;t stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food , think about the sustainable nature of it , then we may fail .
&quot; two boys hit me today in school .
we needed proof .
i know , i was like this , i was shocked .
some 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag , while the opposite hashtag , # oslohero , there was like a handful of tweets written .
it used to be haram , forbidden , by the previous grand mufti .
so if i live to see 80 years of age , i &apos;m going to have a five-hour video that encapsulates 50 years of my life .
personally , i &apos;m tired of forgetting , and this is a really easy thing to do .
thank you .
one of the biggest enemies are the storms .
it was the first dna phage , dna virus , dna genome that was actually sequenced .
it turns out , the dna in the bacterial cell was actually methylated , and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme , from digesting the dna .
so in the remaining information , in the watermarks , contain the names of , i think it &apos;s 46 different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds ?
but every time i thought i was beginning to get a handle on the koran -- that feeling of &quot; i get it now &quot; -- it would slip away overnight , and i &apos;d come back in the morning wondering if i wasn &apos;t lost in a strange land , and yet the terrain was very familiar .
old-fashioned orientalism comes into play here .
nobody tells anybody what to do .
then , as soon as the ants -- the first group of ants -- emerge , they &apos;re larvae . then they &apos;re pupae . then they come out as adult ants .
and that &apos;s the process that i call task allocation .
when the foragers come in with food , they just drop it into the upper chamber , and other ants come up from below , get the food , bring it back , husk the seeds , and pile them up .
here it is about 40 minutes later .
but the foragers somehow decide not to come out .
and we &apos;ve just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads , and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .
for a long time in my life , i felt like i &apos;d been living two different lives .
and we have a tendency , as a society , to look at that and go , &quot; so what ? &quot;
it &apos;s very real , and if you think that it isn &apos;t , ask yourself this : would you rather make your next facebook status say you &apos;re having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you &apos;re having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you &apos;re depressed ?
the world i believe in is one where we &apos;re measured by our ability to overcome adversities , not avoid them .
so this is the next step from there to here , and this is getting commercialized today .
yesterday you heard about molecular biology , which fundamentally computes to build .
do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream , but you can &apos;t because you &apos;re at work , or you &apos;re in a classroom , or you &apos;re watching your children , or you &apos;re in any number of situations where it &apos;s just not permitted ?
so , in place after place we saw this same progression : that we &apos;d open one of these fab labs , where we didn &apos;t -- this is too crazy to think of .
they were tens of thousands of dollars , hard to use , but they brought computing down to work groups , and everything we do today happened there .
so , we &apos;re just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication , where the output of computation programs the physical world .
and it continues .
so when somebody says , &quot; let &apos;s go more nuclear , let &apos;s go wind , let &apos;s go solar , &quot; fine ; i &apos;m for anything american , anything american .
natural gas will fit all of those .
and yet , we have no energy plan .
it &apos;s my life .
i can tell you it will be a failure .
never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else .
yeah , sure , i &apos;m game for it .
and the parallels between the gold rush and the internet rush continue very strongly .
and they didn &apos;t plan right .
you know , it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power .
now , not all these things were highly successful .
that was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances -- because it didn &apos;t make any sense .
but the good thing is , with innovation , there isn &apos;t a last nugget .
i think it &apos;s probably the case that , in the human evolutionary lineage , even before there were homo sapiens , feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way into the gene pool , and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened .
basically it &apos;s just like , if you &apos;re my enemy , if you &apos;re my rival -- if you &apos;re not my friend , if you &apos;re not in my family -- i &apos;m much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you .
so , there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life .
certainly , a couple of things are that , first of all , there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world .
but , nobody ever said that doing god &apos;s work was going to be easy . thanks .
nevertheless , alice stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in the lancet in 1956 .
that means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
so , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
once upon a time , i did a book called &quot; how buildings learn . &quot;
we looked at mesas in new mexico .
january 7003 . there it is .
and then , based on that principle , he started looking around at the various trees at timberline , and realized that the bristlecone pines -- he found some in the white mountains that were over 4,000 years old .
way more interesting than monterey even today .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; be careful , be careful , be careful . &quot;
this is danny hillis , and he &apos;s figuring out a design problem .
they say , &quot; pin peya obe &quot; -- welcome to the mountain .
although we flew straight over this bridge , we imaged it in 3d , captured its color in just a few seconds .
red is extremely high carbon stocks , your largest cathedral forests you can imagine , and blue are very low carbon stocks .
and then we can digitally remove the forest and see what &apos;s going on below the canopy .
thank you .
rous discovered this in 1911 .
but how does context signal ?
but before we do that , i &apos;d like you to think that at any given time when you &apos;re sitting there , in your 70 trillion cells , the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus , the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix and this is how your balance is kept and restored .
they are the future and i try to make them not be afraid of being the cat and being told , don &apos;t think outside the box .
you believed in your principles .
and they &apos;re aimed at protecting the relationships .
what does technology do to deception with those folks ?
in fact , they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch , what we say in the lab as &quot; strong rounding up . &quot;
a lot of humans have lived since then .
and how many of you think that b is ?
now , if we bring it back to deception , there &apos;s a couple of take-away things here .
man 9 : google , say &quot; delicious &quot; in thai .
it was like cell phones strapped to your head .
i don &apos;t know where inspiration comes from .
because it &apos;s mortifying , and yet it feels ...
because it &apos;s all of these things that i love all kind of in one place .
i forgot that i said that . but it &apos;s really true .
thanks . bye .
i learned how to use email from the extremist organization that i used .
the old mentality with a capital o , as represented by the nation-state , not yet fully into the age of behavior , not recognizing the power of transnational social movements , got left behind .
that we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that -- we associate believing in the universality of our values -- with extremists .
and what &apos;s needed is a genuine transnational youth-led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture -- which is necessarily more than just elections .
because now that media is increasingly social , innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we &apos;re all in this together .
every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well , because the same equipment -- phones , computers -- let you consume and produce .
and then this happened .
relatively sparse number of producers .
i understand where you are coming from .
it &apos;s actually a wind-chill factor which is lower than a summer day on mars .
it &apos;s the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall .
a storm blew in that no one was anticipating .
we really had no idea what was going on during that storm .
they picked the name for their baby .
and beck told me that story very quietly , but i was absolutely stunned by it .
he &apos;s beginning to focus , he can concentrate now .
let me talk about india through the evolution of ideas .
what is unique about this demographic dividend is that india will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend .
and really there are four things here .
then we have what i believe are the ideas in conflict .
why does what &apos;s happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you ?
number two , they were going to be based at lsa anaconda , so i knew they would have internet access .
george w. bush : the world &apos;s newest democracy .
you know , i can answer questions about my movie , but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time .
sp : it just looked like , you know , someone had thrown a quarter through a guy , and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds .
the way i learned about taji was steve pink sent me an email , and in it , attached a photo of that burned body out at the car .
and usually , the first questions are , &quot; oh , what kind of cameras did you use ? &quot;
deborah scranton : an iraq war movie crowd-sourced from soldiers
only 18 percent of italians and 15 percent of greeks believe that their vote matters .
all this was very much under attack .
these days it &apos;s very popular to believe that this push for transparency , this kind of a combination between active citizens , new technologies and much more transparency-friendly legislation can restore trust in politics .
and this is goethe , who is neither bulgarian nor a political scientist , some centuries ago he said , &quot; there is a big shadow where there is much light . &quot;
so we find some investors , and they pay for a set of services , and if those services are successful , then they improve outcomes , and with those measured reductions in re-offending , government saves money , and with those savings , they can pay outcomes .
investors have put in 3.1 million pounds .
this leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change .
i go , &quot; you &apos;re the driver , you should know . &quot; he goes , &quot; no , i just arrived , sir . &quot;
hello , habibi . just don &apos;t move . just stay there please .
the next time you &apos;re on an airplane in the u.s. , just speak your mother tongue .
look at this , mom ! i made it !
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;d like to introduce you to a very special friend of mine , one of the greatest double bassists i know .
we got our first panel out on december third .
so my hope is that when you leave ted , you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it .
and you know also about lithotripsy -- breaking kidney stones .
&quot; on june 20th , &quot; if you can read it , &quot; 2011 . &quot;
but the point is we are right on target .
pain is something that can make your life miserable .
and doing that in the u.s .
and in 2010 , she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby .
well , yeah .
the courts have said over and over again , &quot; you don &apos;t need any more intellectual property protection . &quot;
he came up with this bowden-wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium ; if you make it from some sort of cheaper material , it &apos;ll actually crack in two .
a person can come in and take somebody else &apos;s gown , cut off three inches from the bottom , go to the e.u. and register it as a new , original design .
fireworks displays , the rules of games , the smell of perfume : no .
he &apos;s smart , he &apos;s smart .
and then a few days later , we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream near our campsite , where the fish were so abundant that you could literally reach into the stream and grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands .
it also happens to be male and , in theory immortal .
this is something called an underground forest .
it &apos;s my hope that , by going to find these organisms , that i can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future .
that means it &apos;s completely remixable . it also means there &apos;s no proprietary software . all you need is a web browser .
we call this value-based healthcare .
so they in fact spent two years debating , &quot; so what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;
the united states has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in oecd .
next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
in the hands of the ted community , these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world , but in the hands of suicide bombers , the future can look quite different .
and the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in pakistan , where they monitored the bbc , al jazeera , cnn and indian local stations .
ten people brought 20 million people to a standstill , and this traveled around the world .
every time a new technology is being introduced , criminals are there to exploit it .
and to hackers , dna is just another operating system waiting to be hacked .
for those of you who follow me on twitter , i will be tweeting out the answer later on today .
if we all do our part , i think we &apos;ll be in a much better space .
and as a woman who didn &apos;t get married until i was a lot older -- and i &apos;m glad i waited -- -- and has no children , i look at these young people and i say , &quot; your job is not to be perfect .
and i sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands -- beautiful rhythms -- as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them , wearing these beautiful silk colors .
my own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive .
and so i asked jawad , &quot; how do you guys navigate ? this is a really diverse community .
my final story is about a young , beautiful man named josephat byaruhanga , who was another acumen fund fellow , who hails from uganda , a farming community .
his contemporaries made faces , like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters .
what was the age of leonardo at the time ? does that fit ?
by this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities .
now in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context .
and yet now it &apos;s represented in substantially finer grain .
i &apos;m going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity-based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and , thereafter , as a reader .
and you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants .
you can look down in the brain of a child in a variety of tasks that scientists have at stanford , and mit , and ucsf , and ucla , and a number of other institutions .
what you did in the early marriage days , you tried to impress your wife . i did the same .
but even sisters , wives , they &apos;re not ready to support in the research .
what if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one ?
like that , i never chased mahalakshmi .
what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world , and show me just how fragile the world is .
it couldn &apos;t be further from the truth for me .
a number of years ago , he tried to ski all the way to the north pole .
and so i now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice .
and equally , when it comes to climate change , every single country is going to have to make cuts .
so oil is playing a less significant role every year .
very specialized material that the abalone self-assembles , millions of abalone , all the time , every day , every year .
sixties , seventies , eighties and nineties .
this was not a devastating stroke , but it did affect his speaking and so forth .
and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that george abbott actually could talk .
and i thought , this is going to be a piece of cake , because i always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes .
and the way she died -- she had , toward the end , a brain tumor .
and i asked him one question .
she wasn &apos;t about to make up for this occasion .
here &apos;s the thing , everybody loves a beautiful baby .
so recognition is fantastic .
so we started with them saying , &quot; well what do you want ?
from a phototherapy standpoint , maybe not the best behavior .
so the idea here is we say , you want to make it hard to use wrong .
i &apos;ve since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world , you have to design outcomes .
we are not talking about 50,000 dollars here , or 100,000 dollars there , or one million dollars there .
this is what these other cultures demand .
so , we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself .
i choose a painting . it might just be one painting in 50 .
a servant , a lovely servant .
and in fact , he painted four versions of this painting , different boys building houses of cards , all concentrated .
you put all those together , and you &apos;ve got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back .
&quot; congratulations on your upcoming nuptials , james .
and it really was a place where i learned to walk .
action .
you &apos;ll crack your ribs .
move it .
the nigerian filmmakers really , really , are doing what they like .
i think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers , and i think that the nigerian filmmakers really have proved this .
there are challenges . there are challenges .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m talking to you today about the age of design , and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture , is still posters , is still fast cars , what you see at moma today .
last week , guardian art critic blah blah suggested that games cannot qualify as art . but is he right ?
and you know , the amount of work -- yeah , alexey pajitnov was working for the soviet government and that &apos;s how he developed tetris , and alexey himself reconstructed the whole game and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube that makes it look slightly bombed .
it was a playstation game , but mostly for japan .
we have street fighter ii , because martial arts are good .
time . the way we experience time in video games , as in other forms of interaction design , is really quite amazing .
and the same with the &quot; @ &quot; sign that we acquired a few years ago .
i tried to be inclusive , to include the buildings in the neighborhood , whether they were buildings i liked or not .
it was pretty hard .
i play with funny people like &#91; claes &#93; oldenburg .
like a morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life .
i mean , it &apos;s kind of a trite thing to say , but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be , where the people would come and where the people working would interact .
in boston , we had that old building on the left .
it &apos;s kind of like a whole built town .
burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built , and so we followed .
left -- it &apos;s my right .
these are the early studies , but they have to sell furniture to normal people , so if i did the building and it was too fancy , then people might say , &quot; well , the furniture looks ok in his thing , but no , it ain &apos;t going to look good in my normal building . &quot;
and i keep thinking , &quot; this is going to be the last fish . &quot;
it &apos;s actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff .
we finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls , which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they weren &apos;t , but now we have them .
we cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel .
it leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation .
so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes .
and he &apos;s looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal .
these are the solutions that we need to find .
amy smith : simple designs to save a life
max has kindly donated his photograph to me .
how long did you spend looking in the mirror every day , practicing your sardonic look , practicing your serious look , trying to look like sean connery , as i did , trying to raise one eyebrow ?
but over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations , as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly .
they don &apos;t feel different .
and beauty doesn &apos;t equate to goodness , and certainly doesn &apos;t equate to contentment .
we then bent a plate up to it .
we &apos;ve got mouth cancer to solve .
we now live in a country where most of us don &apos;t decide , by and large , what we eat . we see big businesses , monsanto and dupont , who brought out agent orange and stain-resistant carpet .
and we spend 35,000 dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison , and school districts spend 500 dollars a year feeding a child .
everything came in plastic , in cardboard .
or the generation after , to be able to think like this if they &apos;re not nourished .
because , you know what , many of us are sort of at the end of our careers , and we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids , the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet .
and just remember , at very least tacitly , this is what we &apos;re teaching children as what they should be doing .
thank you .
ok , because i &apos;m going to do it very quick .
we just don &apos;t know how to show this . &quot;
so when you come to tedglobal , you can check it out .
more hemp houses -- it &apos;s a theme in japan apparently .
cs : we started architecture for humanity with 700 dollars and a website .
so let &apos;s take those ideas , adapt them and we can use them .
these clouds can grow so big , up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere .
they all have an idea for a video game , even if they &apos;re not experts .
not a single one of those cells is conscious ; not a single one of those cells knows who you are , or cares .
&quot; he merely makes you think that he does . &quot;
that &apos;s the detail part .
how many of you rotated the one on the right ? ok .
but there &apos;s still a sort of filling in , as we can tell if we look at this .
2.9 seconds .
it exists in basically all of the cities all around the world , which is a little bit surprising when you think about it .
now , stockholm is a medium-sized city , roughly two million people , but stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges , old bridges -- which means lots of road congestion .
now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know , but i would say that the most surprising slide here i &apos;m going to show you today is not this one . it &apos;s this one .
it &apos;s an unfortunate reality in nearly every major city — road congestion , especially during rush hours . jonas eliasson reveals how subtly nudging just a small percentage of drivers to stay off major roads can make traffic jams a thing of the past .
what do we know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in balkh ?
here , just for historical authenticity , is a picture of me in that year .
he said , &quot; yeah , we &apos;re going to need to do a ct scan of your chest . &quot;
how does that happen ?
very quickly they told me , &quot; kidney cancer is an uncommon disease .
the punch line is that a year and a half later , i was there when this magnificent young woman , my daughter , got married .
and i saw , &quot; aha , that &apos;s the kidney and the soleus muscle . &quot;
what she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data .
we take the water from the sea and we apply pressure .
who here thought of a bat ?
really , of course the famous book &quot; dracula , &quot; written by a fellow northside dubliner bram stoker , probably is mainly responsible for this .
now when we &apos;ve been doing this , we &apos;ve realized that there &apos;s variations within our genome .
but we are going to have to understand it a bit better .
emma teeling : the secret of the bat genome
so , total reversal of trade policy .
so gdp goes up a lot -- fantastic ! that &apos;s the short run .
it &apos;s called the extractive industries transparency initiative .
my wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks , and the blog comment said , &quot; collier is not charismatic -- -- but his arguments are compelling . &quot;
we do about five million of these in the united states and maybe 20 million of these worldwide .
and i think that we can develop some tools to do so .
maybe we have something to learn as well .
students may display captions in their native language .
i was an unlikely person to be doing this .
for two years , i searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
so i contacted noaa , and i asked if they &apos;d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
and i worked in mines . and i realized that this was a world unseen .
i &apos;ve always had stage fright , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit .
and this is not the good kind of vibrato , like an opera singer has , this is my whole body just convulsing with fear .
would it be okay if i played the stage fright song for you ?
if he can see this pattern in his own brain , he can learn how to control it .
and , consequently , most people -- i think most people probably here -- think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; what is worth living for ? &quot;
even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality -- his rather unfortunate personality -- is the product of his brain .
as we just heard from michael specter , it has changed over the years .
now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; wrong &quot; in boston or palo alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
so , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one &apos;s time .
we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
sh : well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
and what is the natural enemy , the biologically controlled agent , or the good bug , that we are talking about ?
and here you can see this parasite in action , like in an acrobatic maneuver .
no harm to the developing fruit . no harm to the fruit set .
so the impact is very strong .
so i think my last slide is : all we are saying , we can actually sing it : give nature a chance .
but the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man .
the copy , which you can &apos;t see because it goes on and on for several pages , says that steerage passengers can &apos;t get their to bunks before the voyage is over , and it &apos;s so safe it carries no insurance .
it was perfectly clear . i didn &apos;t do any thinking about it .
in their final years , jim and shirley faced cancers , fractures , infections , neurological illness .
don &apos;t assume the natural choice is your spouse or child .
obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor . if anyone tells you that there is a single-factor explanation for societal collapses , you know right away that they &apos;re an idiot . this is a complex subject .
easter , of all pacific islands , has the least input of dust from asia restoring the fertility of its soils . but that &apos;s a factor that we didn &apos;t even appreciate until 1999 .
but still , you &apos;re not representing the overall population of the earth .
and here you see me in a small , provincial town in china , lijiang -- about two million inhabitants .
now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me , for everyone on this earth .
and a pig disease , a pig virus , and a human virus can both proliferate , and because of their kind of reproduction , they can combine and produce a new virus .
i gave you at least four arguments in favor .
so we have to get used to the idea of eating insects .
but i am not as nervous as i was five weeks ago .
i would still be on my bad hip . that was so disappointing .
it &apos;s gonna be so great when the pain stops . ow ! &quot;
so , an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today &apos;s world .
this is a rule device . and on the back are some other devices , measuring tools and scales , to be able to make some calculations . okay ?
as you glance at your ipod to just check out the time .
every technology is transformed and moved by others .
you &apos;re using your built-in dynamics , the physics of your body , just like a pendulum .
so , in this video we &apos;re using an approach called the reactive approach .
also for search and rescue applications as well .
the problem is they &apos;re just too expensive , tens of thousands of dollars .
so , this does not have any sensors .
what you see over here , this is the beautiful louis vuitton cup trophy .
and then i think , &quot; ah this is cool . &quot;
so , there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition .
bertie county is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural america .
so to say that the public education system in bertie county is struggling would be a huge understatement .
the initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with dr. zullinger -- that was why we were there .
it &apos;s a vocational training path .
ultimately , design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers .
now , because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter , when we damage soils , you give off carbon .
you have changed the microclimate .
when i first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much-vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification , i was faced with a real dilemma .
and look at the amazing change in this one , where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature , and once more , we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying .
&quot; desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert , &quot; begins allan savory in this quietly powerful talk . and it &apos;s happening to about two-thirds of the world &apos;s grasslands , accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos . savory has devoted his life to stopping it . he now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert .
the prakash , the overall effort has three components : outreach , to identify children in need of care ; medical treatment ; and in subsequent study .
so , hers is just a truly inspiring story -- unknown , but inspiring story .
doctor : what are their shapes ?
the way we test dylan is by giving it inputs , as i said , of the same kind that a baby , or a child in project prakash would get .
looking ahead , if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we &apos;ve treated so far , this is the magnitude of the problem .
and so i decided to give this a shot : heart pounding , i ran my first race and i beat the national record-holder by three hundredths of a second , and became the new national record-holder on my first try out .
and i went out there and made it to the big east , which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season .
i tried to get it out of anybody i could , you know , &quot; who am i running against here ? &quot;
ss : you know , show us more than one set of legs .
so when i stand in these legs , my hamstring and my glutes are contracted , as they would be had i had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet .
&quot; no , no , no , no . i &apos;ve got these special feet that need a two-inch heel . i have a three-inch heel .
so eric would have won . he was the first person to pin my thumb .
any other thumbs ?
you lost both your thumbs .
now rather than just argue about this number , a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he &apos;ll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the westin , and then to mars ...
it &apos;s the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated .
well actually , i think the answer is staring us right in the face : use computers .
turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form .
so we better be damn sure -- and by the way , they didn &apos;t even have fun doing it , most of them -- so we better be damn sure that we know why we &apos;re doing that and it has a real purpose .
i don &apos;t think so .
now , of course , like any great tool , they can be used completely mindlessly , like turning everything into a multimedia show , like the example i was shown of solving an equation by hand , where the computer was the teacher -- show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand .
and we open up so many more possibilities .
how many years of protection do i need ?
they argued with my wife for me , and they read my son bedtime stories .
so i decided , what if you really did take the bible literally ?
you know , i could spend a year not killing , but spending a year not gossiping , not coveting , not lying -- you know , i live in new york , and i work as a journalist , so this was 75 , 80 percent of my day i had to do it .
this became very , very clear , early on .
this was one of the great things about my year , doing the sabbath , because i am a workaholic , so having this one day where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life .
and i would say , &quot; but that &apos;s crazy . &quot;
it &apos;s like the land and the king they &apos;re inseparable , they are one .
and that means input and output are in the same space enabling stuff like this .
now , if these ideas seem familiar or perhaps even a little dated , that &apos;s great ; they should seem familiar .
and now , if we want to select stuff , 3d , space , the idea that we &apos;re tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in , not in 2d , not in fake 2d , but in actual 3d .
so collaborative work , whether it &apos;s immediately co-located or distant and distinct , is always important .
but does that mean that , at your desk or in your home , you need projectors , cameras ?
and okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on .
the media landscape in the 20th century was very good at helping people consume , and we got , as a result , very good at consuming .
so before i talk about what is , i think , the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi , i want to talk about their shared source .
they were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones .
we can use it to crack each other up , and we &apos;re going to do that .
or you could play many games in one small patch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
india didn &apos;t want to play the t20 world cup .
but was india ready for it ?
and all of a sudden , indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .
can you imagine ?
what india was doing , though , was benchmarking itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand .
and surely , if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times , that would be a tremendous gift .
for example , when americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways -- these are estimates of number of deaths per year per 200 million u.s. citizens .
leroy has nine tickets ; there &apos;s one left .
this tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal . in other words , a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal .
if you &apos;re a smart retailer , then , you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf , because suddenly the $ 33 wine doesn &apos;t look as expensive in comparison .
when you go to buy groceries with it , it doesn &apos;t go , i &apos;m the money saved on the car stereo , or , i &apos;m the dumb money saved on the car . it &apos;s money .
that is , they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars .
we have time for some questions for dan gilbert . one and two .
people died ; so be it .
&apos;theme and variations &apos; is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity , because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind .
i &apos;m going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster .
and one day i woke up and i said , &quot; well , suppose that &apos;s not true ? &quot;
i mean -- you &apos;ve got to be confident ; if you don &apos;t believe in your work , who else is going to believe in it ?
now this says , &quot; note to the viewer : i thought i might use a visual cliche of our time -- magritte &apos;s everyman -- to express the idea that art is mystery , continuity and history .
okay , turn back , if you didn &apos;t look .
the way that we measured this was by a scale that was constructed by some other psychologists that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations how likely they are to feel disgust .
let me give you an example of what i mean by harmless but taboo sexual practice . we gave them scenarios .
my mum wanted to , couldn &apos;t afford it .
marcus : simple . what do you rap about ?
what , what , what , what about , what ?
cs : this is the gun .
i &apos;m interested .
war is a crime , yes , but i did not start it .
that was a very moving piece .
we can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power .
and the glass -- luckily i turned around -- i had it all in my back and i was about 15 feet away .
i was visiting with an artist , michael heizer , out in the desert near las vegas somewhere .
fg : i don &apos;t really know .
fg : i knew you &apos;d ask that question .
rsw : what &apos;s his schedule on that ?
i met them in bilbao .
and i think that &apos;s the issue , you know ; it &apos;s the &quot; then what &quot; that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren &apos;t hiring architects for that .
&quot; you &apos;re not going to have dinner at all ? &quot;
well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry , it &apos;s become pretty clear to me that we don &apos;t necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults .
most of it &apos;s incinerated or landfilled .
this is a photo i took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in mumbai , india .
i don &apos;t know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way .
this is the same material that you would get from oil .
this rebirth of grass . and then i went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape .
but there &apos;s this consequence out there .
so what you see here is the three gorges dam , and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man .
there were no parks ; there were no green spaces .
and so they &apos;re holding off until they get a deal with them .
right now that &apos;s all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago -- and high-rises are now going up into that central spot .
the machines are all running , absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are .
this is certainly connected to california and silicon valley .
so we &apos;re looking at this as trying to build out .
and they &apos;re going to push that up , from the bottom -- up into , i believe , into the households . and parents will be reacting to it , and trying to help them with the projects .
this means that your great , great , great great , great , great -- with about five million &quot; greats &quot; in there -- grandmother was probably the same great , great , great , great grandmother with five million &quot; greats &quot; in there as holly up here .
the question is : is this anything like human money ?
so we said , this looks bad .
and this means that sometimes we &apos;ll actually switch our preferences to avoid this .
the guy on the right is the risky loss .
so that &apos;s the bad news . the question is : is there any good news ?
that &apos;s a wonderful thing .
but if you take that wood and you put it into a building or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy , it actually has an amazing capacity to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration .
but to build a fire , you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up , and eventually you can add the log to the fire , and when you do add the log to the fire , of course , it burns , but it burns slowly .
it just happens to be that mother nature holds the patent , and we don &apos;t really feel comfortable with it .
then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy ?
what this shows is that people who walk are third-class citizens while those who go in cars are first-class citizens .
we have had cities for 8,000 years , and children could walk out of home and play .
but unfortunately , reality is not as good as my dreams .
for mom said , &quot; to be family , is to care and share and to look out for one another .
and , like chief seattle said , &quot; we did not spin the web of life .
i saw it when the dalai lama came to the riverside church while i was a pastor , and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world .
to be a pastor is to care for these individual needs .
well , when i got to the white house in the beginning of 2009 , at the start of the obama administration , the white house was anything but open .
sure , we invest plenty in innovation . we invest in broadband and science education and science grants , but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning the institutions that we have .
created after the post-election riots in kenya in 2008 , this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble , whether it &apos;s after the earthquakes in haiti , or more recently in italy .
and transparency , by itself , is not reducing the flow of money into politics , and arguably , it &apos;s not even producing accountability as well as it might if we took the next step of combining participation and collaboration with transparency to transform how we work .
thank you .
and that is that those museums are usually passive , they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience , as the receiver of information .
where would it go ?
it &apos;s basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction .
but it can &apos;t be more lit than the capitol or some of the monuments .
there is no newspaper to cover her pain , and what she wants to change in this society .
but my story is huge .
as a child so young and tender , words i can &apos;t forget i still remember .
so what &apos;s happening here ?
they only get the food that drops from the sky , from the u.n .
are you guys ready to celebrate emma ?
the third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding .
and they went from chapter three in the late 1980s to chapter two in the mid-1990s . and beginning in the mid- to late-1990s , they began to focus on chapter one of the story .
now , during each of these five chapters : when his mother was pregnant with him ; in his early childhood years ; when he was in elementary school ; when he was in middle school and then high school ; and when he was in the juvenile justice system -- during each of those five chapters , there were a wide variety of things that society could have done .
some of the people in the room might be old enough to remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial .
and my father smiled and said , &quot; well , you know what that means , don &apos;t you ? &quot;
it was too late for me , but maybe i could help someone else , someone who could use the information .
one day , two mormon missionaries came to my door .
all but one guy , this guy named mormon , who managed to survive by hiding in the woods .
and i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want it back . i &apos;m happy without it . &quot; gosh .
a deer freezes very , very still , poised to run away .
it &apos;s not nearly as important as health .
they are the u.s.a. , other western countries going across in those triangles and a few gulf states in there actually .
they have one of the highest literacy rates in latin america and in the world .
i think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing .
the fastest way out of a bad mood : step outside , go for a walk , turn the radio on and dance .
and not only that , we need to create a great transition to get there , and we need to pave that great transition with good things .
then i realized that what i was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit -- that i felt good about myself .
when we focus on ourselves in any activity , we do turn that part of ourselves off if there &apos;s another person .
but all it took was that simple act of noticing , and so i &apos;m optimistic .
so we move along linear routes and our mind straightens streets and perceives turns as 90-degree angles .
but when you explore a foreign and new public transport system , you will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way .
in this map , i &apos;m including each transport mode , so rapid transport , bus , dart , tram and the likes .
and he , the positive soul that he is , said , &quot; no , this is just a hiatus , a hiatus during the treatment , and you &apos;ll get back to doing what you do best . &quot;
durga , the epitome of creative feminine energy , or shakti .
and so he gave me the time to code it up .
i asked everybody , more or less , to put their documents -- i said , &quot; could you put your documents on this web thing ? &quot;
so , i can go ahead and look that thing up .
in fact if you &apos;re responsible -- if you know about some data in a government department , often you find that these people , they &apos;re very tempted to keep it -- hans calls it database hugging .
scientists are totally stymied at the moment -- the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems .
so , linked data -- it &apos;s huge .
so i think this is amazing living proof of progress that more people should know about , but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news is probably the subject of a different tedtalk .
and if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment , and that comment turned into a commitment , we could crowdsource a force of 300 million people around the world to help see these goals through .
but i &apos;m confident , with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one , i think we can get this and other goals done .
jamie drummond : let &apos;s crowdsource the world &apos;s goals
and i think if you start a business without financial backing , you &apos;re likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line .
i mean , what are the numbers on this ?
do you like to be called sir richard , or how ?
well , i got pulled out of the sea i think six times by helicopters , so -- and each time , i didn &apos;t expect to come home to tell the tale .
the years -- and until i stopped looking at the polls , you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the u.k. and elsewhere .
rb : she was , you know , she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age .
and he said , &quot; look , bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever .
and i think it &apos;s important that the individuals , who are in that fortunate position , do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats , and bigger and bigger cars , but , you know , use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world .
no , i just want to live life to its full .
i think you should study in a school of art .
what i did here , i just put like 10 feet &#91; of &#93; paper then put a coconut rope , and just burnt it .
if you look at this piece of paper , this is the breadth and this is called length .
please come for the show . &quot;
and what i &apos;d like to tell you is we don &apos;t see shadow , and we don &apos;t see light too ; we see the source of the light .
so that hole actually makes the air come out and go in .
so let &apos;s start off with plain old telephone service .
second , these are pretty large errors . for four quantities whose average value is less than 10 percent , you have people guessing three , four times that level .
because , in some sense , it &apos;s the ideal kind of technology to think about . theoretically , it makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door .
if we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one , we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the rio summit 20 years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on .
in this short , image-packed talk , marisa fick-jordan talks about how a village of traditional zulu wire weavers built a worldwide market for their dazzling work .
the act of observation changes it .
if we go back 20 years , the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand .
the hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings , like the bow of a violin , to produce music .
because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity , and we know that because there &apos;s all this language in english that seems to be talking about baseball but that &apos;s really talking about sexual activity .
and when you get together to play baseball , immediately you &apos;re with two opposing teams , one playing offense , one playing defense , somebody &apos;s trying to move deeper into the field .
and even if you &apos;ve had pizza with somebody for a very long time , don &apos;t you still say things like , &quot; should we get the usual ? &quot;
so what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education ?
and then you just focus on this person .
and my final question was always the same .
for every trend on this planet , there &apos;s a counter-trend .
we now know the brain circuitry of imagination , of long-term planning .
so we &apos;re seeing there &apos;s a real extension of middle age .
they want to commit suicide or kill somebody else .
but i want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate .
but i was committed to making sure that i could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable . i brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee .
this is called fuel partitioning in the lingo .
so now , when insulin says to a cell , i want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe , the cell , in effect , says , &quot; no thanks , i &apos;d actually rather store this energy . &quot;
what if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong ?
i know it &apos;s tempting to want an answer right now , some form of action or policy , some dietary prescription -- eat this , not that — but if we want to get it right , we &apos;re going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription .
by birth and by choice , i &apos;ve been involved with the auto industry my entire life , and for the past 30 years , i &apos;ve worked at ford motor company .
my other great passion is the environment .
when we look at the population growth in terms of cars , it becomes even clearer .
and up above , you &apos;ve got a series of pedestrian walkways .
companies , entrepreneurs , venture capitalists , they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity , as well as an enormous social problem .
charlie ledbetter , yesterday , i thought , talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers , to bring people into the process of creating things .
it &apos;s not about huge , ridiculous things that we need to do .
this was a device that a nurse uses when they &apos;re doing a spinal procedure in hospital .
we sort of assume that because there &apos;s a pole in the street , that it &apos;s okay to use it , so we park our shopping cart there .
so what is this ? i hear you all ask . no , i don &apos;t .
we feel that this is an important gesture .
and that can &apos;t happen in a classroom .
then 30,000 children in ahmedabad , and growing .
k girls and boys in hyderabad , going out , pretty difficult , but they did it .
how far you can anticipate , what follows from it , what are the threats , what are the possibilities , the challenges , the opportunities ?
in other words , as i might seek to demonstrate , if you could achieve the impossible , the equivalent of perpetual motion , you could design a carbon-free house , for example .
in 2001 , this building received an award .
so if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in germany , and here you can see the guy with his computer screen , and those points in space are communicated .
but meanwhile , as you know , wonderful protagonists like al gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature , set in the context of that , interestingly , those buildings which are celebratory and very , very relevant to this place .
so it also has the ability , all the time , regardless of the direction of the wind , to be able to make the building fresh and efficient .
and the challenge here is a building that will be green , that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel , is about friendly , is coming back to that starting point , is very , very much about the lifestyle .
he meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun .
and he coined three terms , which are &quot; focal glow , &quot; &quot; ambient luminescence &quot; and &quot; play of the brilliants &quot; -- three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience .
and that is how , maybe in the near future , light can help hospitals to make people better sooner , recover them quicker .
because the new technologies , they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments .
can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness ?
in architecture , it works just the same .
i tried to convince myself that , &quot; no , no , i have worked for the policy changes .
so , obviously , you cannot have two principles of justice , one for yourself and one for others .
just do it 10 times ; you will realize the pain in this shoulder .
please do not ever think that only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment .
a lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground .
you know ? but here in this clay hot plate , it will never go into your stomach .
and we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio , will invest in the portfolio , where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities , and yet , the overall platform of the model will become viable .
and this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms , rather than only a few , because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her &#91; unclear &#93; would climb on that .
these three people in the village sat down and decided to think , &quot; how do we elongate the life of this girl of our village ? &quot;
this morning , the world &apos;s experts from i guess three or four different companies on building seats , i think concluded that ultimately , the solution is , people shouldn &apos;t sit down .
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities .
or snowmobiles . you don &apos;t need the snow .
he agreed . we went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat , carrying 70 pounds of stuff . they love it .
we &apos;ve got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense , rich , green-space environment , without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it .
we need water .
however , while it &apos;s easier to think of us , the citizens , the police , the army , as the good guys , and them , the narcos , the carteles , as the bad guys , if you think about it , the latter are only providing a service to the former .
so what they currently run is truly and quite literally a franchise business .
like any other multinational would , they protect their brand by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model , like for example , when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations , they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them , and they try to separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this .
and this is one way to do technology forecasting : get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn .
they &apos;re not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they &apos;re just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods .
and finally , free . free is really , really interesting .
and their policy prescription is to make government more accountable , focus on the capital markets , invest , don &apos;t give anything away .
they were creating subsidies either for large farms , or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use , rather than that the farmers wanted to use .
and they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for africans around the world .
that these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day , provide real pathways to hope .
i know it works .
you may have heard about rathergate , which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the &quot; th &quot; in 111 is not typesetted on an old typewriter ; it &apos;s on word .
and i won it . i reached all of these people , and i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday .
i &apos;m like , i don &apos;t want to write this anymore , and i slowly and slowly -- and i did tell personal stories from time to then .
but then it gets better . day 96 he goes home .
i showed a norman rockwell painting before , and this one i grew up with , looking at constantly .
and i remember instantly : i am in germany in this -- i had to go for a one-day trip .
it &apos;s actually got a naked skin for most of its body , so it reduces friction with the water .
this tuna symbolizes what &apos;s the problem for all of us in the room .
what is it that they &apos;re happy with ?
and so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag .
so we can then predict where management places should be .
the tuna team from topp has done the unthinkable : three teams tagged 1,700 tunas , bluefin , yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out , pick up juvenile tunas , put in the tags that actually have the sensors , stick out the tuna and then let them go .
and now with google &apos;s oceans , we can actually put a white shark in that ocean .
so let me show you a little of that .
i was like , &quot; no , no . i &apos;m pretty certain there were no explosives .
so they &apos;re looking at me really odd .
so you can see , delta 1252 going from kansas city to atlanta .
and then sometimes you get this .
so on december 4th , i went here .
so in a way , i &apos;m glad that i &apos;m completely obsolete .
it &apos;s no different than checking an email .
this image here is from 2008 .
now , collaborative consumption is creating the start of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand , but it &apos;s also a part of a massive value shift underway , where instead of consuming to keep up with the joneses , people are consuming to get to know the joneses .
i actually came across this fascinating study by the pew center this week that revealed that an active facebook user is three times as likely as a non-internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy .
what i mean by this is , say he started selling second-hand books on amazon . why should he have to start from scratch ?
now the interesting thing is , reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be generated from , and its applications , are far bigger than this space alone .
if you &apos;re an average sort of person , 36 percent of your life will be spent asleep , which means that if you live to 90 , then 32 years will have been spent entirely asleep .
well , most of us anyway .
it &apos;s really hugely attenuated .
well , thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep , because that &apos;s what your brain is craving .
so there &apos;s a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain .
it &apos;s the worst thing we can possibly do before we went to sleep .
so what &apos;s going on ?
if you have good sleep , it increases your concentration , attention , decision-making , creativity , social skills , health .
the measure we &apos;ve used , because it &apos;s easy to understand and you can download it , is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country .
i &apos;m going to show you some of the separate bits of our index .
there &apos;s a about a tenfold difference there , log scale up the side .
japan is rather different though .
and of course , those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society .
and indeed , people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes .
chances are , if you &apos;re living on less than four dollars a day , and you &apos;re an amputee , you &apos;ve lost your limb in a vehicle accident .
and we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market .
we have fit over 5,000 amputees , and one of the big indicators we &apos;re looking at , of course , is , does it improve lives ?
so we &apos;re experts in physical thinking already .
so just have a little watch about how they &apos;re , how they &apos;re accessing this and what they &apos;re doing , and i &apos;m just going to take this letter &quot; t , &quot; the letter &quot; e , &quot; and the letter &quot; d , &quot; to make something . okay . here goes .
so basically i &apos;m going to make a duet .
okay , not bad . a little bit more ?
i now decide where i &apos;m going to be in that space , so i &apos;m down on this small part of the bottom rib of the letter &quot; e , &quot; and i &apos;m thinking about it , and i &apos;m imagining this space that &apos;s really high and above . if i asked you to reach out — you don &apos;t have to literally do it , but in mind — reach out to the top of the &quot; e , &quot; where would you reach ?
thank you . thank you .
and there &apos;s very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there &apos;s a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be .
i mean , it &apos;s just wonderful .
instead of saying , &quot; you got 73,000 results .
it actually affects the way the brain works .
you get a little problem , you say , &quot; ah , i &apos;ll figure it out . &quot;
this is a kohler shower , a waterfall shower , and actually , all those knobs beneath are also showerheads .
this is a clear don norman watch .
it did not correlate with the poverty levels . it did not correlate .
about eight hours later , we found this kid .
and as soon as they saw me they said , &quot; we need a faster processor and a better mouse . &quot;
and over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer .
but other examples are traffic jams , stock market , society and disaster recovery , terrorism and insurgency .
and it serves you the 404 page .
dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page .
i was born unable to see most colors .
it was really interesting .
secondly , the government had ignored all available alternatives to war , which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still .
18 people were killed .
that was the origin of the thing that became independent diplomat , the world &apos;s first diplomatic advisory group and a non-profit to boot .
the personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing , and i recommend it .
me and my colleagues at independent diplomat went around the u.n. security council .
you &apos;ve got to look at the outputs , and you got to say to yourself , &quot; what can i do to produce that particular output ? &quot;
now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic primal instincts .
and on a factual basis , over 80 percent of the u.s. &apos; s most popular shows are exported around the world .
this is rising . comfort stays whole .
it can change us ?
we had 9 / 11 .
but let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .
and then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides .
so when my students were first learning this , why did they hate it so much ?
and that guy &apos;s like , &quot; actually , it was 87.3 miles . &quot;
leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point .
one of the most exciting to me is this young man , stephen bradley , had an encounter , he thought , with jesus in 1820 .
&quot; i &quot; passes insensibly into a &quot; we , &quot; &quot; my &quot; becomes &quot; our &quot; and individual faith loses its central importance .
is it a product of natural selection , like our hands ?
i mean , these things sound trite , but they are deep evolutionary truths .
once several wasps were all together in the same hive , they had no choice but to cooperate , because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives .
this is why politics is so tribal .
psychologist jonathan haidt asks a simple , but difficult question : why do we search for self-transcendence ? why do we attempt to lose ourselves ? in a tour through the science of evolution by group selection , he proposes a provocative answer .
and there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside .
and so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do , and who they were .
and how does it work ?
opportunity is the gift within every gift , and we have this saying , opportunity knocks only once .
so how can we find a method that will harness this ?
and then we can also open our hearts , our hearts for the opportunities , for the opportunities also to help others , to make others happy , because nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy .
i actually find them a lot more emotional -- -- and personal , and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work , unlike powerpoint and some other programs .
i took some photos , and this is a billboard in florida , and either they hadn &apos;t paid their rent , or they didn &apos;t want to pay their rent again on the sign , and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down , so they just teared out sections of it .
more importantly , it doesn &apos;t mean it communicates the right thing .
and also , surprisingly , it was done in kind of a cheap metal , and it had completely rusted through , and water everywhere , and spiders .
i did some work for microsoft a few years back .
this is an opener for brian eno , and it &apos;s just kind of my personal interpretation of the music .
this is my desktop .
that &apos;s pretty high for most occupations .
he says technology is anything that was invented after you were born .
each one of these organisms that we &apos;ve described -- that you &apos;ve seen from jamie and others , these magnificent things -- what they &apos;re doing , each one of them , is they &apos;re hacking the rules of life .
like those chloroplast cells -- they &apos;re completely surrounded by other life .
in fact , this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that i began to think about what happens with old technology .
and what technology is really about is better ways to evolve .
our humanity is actually defined by technology .
that &apos;s because the way humans resolve conflict shapes our social landscape .
but there &apos;s a second powerful incentive pushing decision-making away from humans and onto machines , and that &apos;s electromagnetic jamming , severing the connection between the drone and its operator .
now it &apos;s typically used to market goods and services to targeted demographics , but it &apos;s a dual-use technology , because targeting is used in another context .
each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed i.d. burned in at the factory that can be used to track its movement through public spaces .
the octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing : it landed on the bottom in the rubble and -- fwoosh ! -- vanished right before my eyes .
anyway , one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef .
and as you go down , the washing machine at the surface calms down .
you might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent , which you think at the time has to be on another planet .
and a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay .
and that i do .
this is a joint effort between me and french artist jr .
and my task is to stand there , trying to be still , setting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant and drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body on the front of my body . if the background is simple , i usually have to stand for three to four hours .
instead , she knew what i needed , and she bought me a book of cartoons .
and then i thought -- in my 40s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos;t i do something ?
here &apos;s some numbers .
is microsoft a great big anthill ?
this is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us , particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner : hockey sticks .
so is london a scaled up birmingham , which is a scaled up brighton , etc . , etc . ?
just to show you what we plotted , here is income , gdp -- gdp of the city -- crime and patents all on one graph .
so the image is that we &apos;re not only on a treadmill that &apos;s going faster , but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster .
and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher , stored it in the only portable memory he has , which is inside his own head , and take it with him , because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world .
we could walk there . we didn &apos;t even have to pay for the buses .
go create . go figure it out .
and what i want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn &apos;t , and where we are clinically today , and where we might go tomorrow , and what some of the hurdles are .
in 2010 , two workers per retiree in the u.s .
how can we do that ?
if the horse was in pain , i wouldn &apos;t show you this slide .
if you give them stem cells as well as their bypass , for these particular patients , they became asymptomatic .
the japanese government were perhaps the first , when they decided to invest first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field .
but then what ?
not only , of course , the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities .
but anyway , you know , i just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people -- literally , some of you , the architects building our brighter future .
like , i love everything about this . it &apos;s amazing .
in fact , the older lady you just met : very , very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother &apos;s side .
my daughter -- my daughter wrote that , she told me , &quot; always start your speech with humor . &quot;
so , for my daughter &apos;s sake , i thank you for your ideas worth spreading .
well , you have to let me say this .
and it &apos;s also something that resides in each of us , to close what i think are the two big calamities in the world today .
and i asked him what he felt was the best thing i could do , or anyone could do , to make a difference in the long-term issues facing humanity .
we ended up with 11 oscar nominations for these films .
everything we do looks at the major issues in the world .
and by the time i was an intern house officer , i could barely afford to maintain my mother &apos;s 13-year-old car -- and i was a paid doctor .
you remember all that oil ?
that &apos;s mike , mike comes out from mississippi .
at 67 percent oxygen saturation , the normal is about 97 .
and guess what , if it all fails , if you can find a car that &apos;s still got a live battery and you stick it in , it will still work . then you can customize it .
and so i committed -- when i left south africa , when i left capetown , i told myself , &quot; this is going to be something that i have to talk about .
at this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown aids and had pneumonia .
we have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies .
so we assume that the internet is a border-busting technology .
but then he goes and champions laws like the infamous &quot; three-strikes &quot; law that would disconnect citizens from the internet for file sharing , which has been condemned by the u.n. special rapporteur on freedom of expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens &apos; right to communications , and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens .
and so when 425 million people finally won the right to choose their own governments , i was ecstatic , but i was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall .
the european union , which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization , transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history , eventually comprising some 500 million people .
sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution , and if the police intervened , they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning , rather than chasing the bad guys .
since the beginning of globalization , the global narcotics market has expanded enormously .
and these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient .
that one is a naked biped . why ?
he said , &quot; everything i &apos;ve been telling you for the last 20 years , forget about it . it was wrong .
all his colleagues said , &quot; this is outrageous .
do you think that &apos;s significant ?
how do they react when i say these things ?
&quot; yeah well we don &apos;t talk about that . let &apos;s talk about something interesting . &quot;
&quot; horizon , &quot; which takes its cue from the academics , won &apos;t touch it with a barge pole .
i quickly made an arrangement with a red cross relief worker , who used his official van to transport the money to lungi airport , freetown , although he did not know the real contents of the box .
and they said that i could just type in &quot; what was i going to say next ? &quot;
and so , this year , chris sent us a ted conference simulator .
so i try to -- -- i try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves , and , hopefully -- whoa , i &apos;m like -- on the page , but it doesn &apos;t exist .
what we need to understand is : what drives the political creature ?
now , i &apos;m going to give you a four paragraph format to work with .
i got this letter when i was first elected , and i still carry it to every council meeting i go to .
db : yes . of course . i love you .
and so you can imagine that , as people are performing inside of the museum itself , you get this sense of this emotional connection , this way in which our face connects with the thousands and tens of thousands of years .
and so we created this idea of an opening gallery called we remember .
and we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable , the types of questions that 9 / 11 itself draws forth for all of us .
three generations ago , we had to actually get people to go out and capture the stories for common people .
and i called it the muttering hat , because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you , but you could detach them and share them with somebody else .
they &apos;re both shrinking and retreating -- and some of them have disappeared altogether .
this is what a five-meter rise in sea levels would look like .
no , i &apos;m not even going to look up . no . &quot;
we begin separating everything into good versus evil .
that &apos;s actually not so bad . if you go back to the carter and even reagan administrations , they were rating the other party 43 , 45 . it &apos;s not terrible .
but beginning in the 1990s , first the house of representatives changed its legislative calendar so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week .
but it &apos;s not just money . it &apos;s also stability versus chaos .
this is something we can do .
living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world , through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism .
so , bottom-up materials actually exist today .
so , you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light , toward the dark foundations .
i was gaunt . i walked as though my legs were wooden .
occasionally , i have hallucinations , like one time i turned around and saw a man with a raised knife .
back inside , i asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as i was .
they strangle , they aspirate their vomit , they suffocate , they have a heart attack .
tell them not to kill me . what have i done wrong ?
american prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer from severe mental illness , and many of them are there because they never received adequate treatment .
we built the hardware and the software .
thank you .
the problem is that all over the west now it looks like this .
but they have no incentive to do so .
rob harmon : how the market can keep streams flowing
so i said on my blog that i wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing , their photography , whatever , to be a member of our staff .
actually , he was meditating on compassion .
it starts with a small group of googlers taking the initiative to do something .
there is the affective component , which is , &quot; i feel for you . &quot;
or , how can you further serve the greater good ?
what does that mean ?
first is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide .
and with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .
and the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid .
it took me a while to understand it , but when i discovered around 24 years of age that i was much more comfortable with objects than with people , i finally decided to really embrace this passion .
and new york has another kind of knack for contemporary art .
what they do best is make a synthesis of human needs , current conditions in economy , in materials , in sustainability issues , and then what they do at the end -- if they are good -- is much more than the sum of its parts .
tony dunne and fiona raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia , like this hideaway furniture that &apos;s made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away ; or even better , the huggable atomic mushroom , which got me an article on the bulletin of atomic scientists of the united states -- i don &apos;t think it ever happened before at moma ; or this faraday chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations .
especially the good ones , not all of them .
now , when i was born , they realized they had a pretty smart kid , and they didn &apos;t want me to go to the neighborhood school , which was free .
the first time he got sick , he recovered .
he was like , i try and i make .
but i walked away from that , because my passion was here , and because i wanted to do things that were fulfilling .
i believe in the power of ideas .
that &apos;s all i needed was a push to go to the next level .
more than that , how do you convince people to run a distance of 26.2 miles at a time they were not even familiar with the word &quot; marathon &quot; ?
we include everyone : the young , the elderly , the disabled , the mentally challenged , the blind , the elite , the amateur runners , even moms with their babies .
this is a place where my friend , abhishek sen was interning .
in india this is called an asha worker .
my business plan is very simple .
now , when i got this , i was -- press caps lock -- absolutely freaked out , okay ?
she &apos;s going to be four years old , and anyone who knows a four-year-old knows that they love to ask , &quot; why ? &quot;
so let &apos;s move to chapter two : the oil era .
the interesting part is that we continue to grow 15 percent every year for the past five years without water .
so a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders .
our objective is to be a millennium city , just like many millennium cities around : istanbul , rome , london , paris , damascus , cairo .
how long was mubarak in power ? 31 .
you have 100,000 people in a nonviolent march , and one idiot or agent provocateur is throwing stones , guess what takes all the cameras ? that one guy .
what will they do ? arrest us ? we are nowhere to be seen .
this is one more reason to look at this phenomenon .
and i said , &quot; let me ask you something . &quot;
vulnerability is not weakness .
at this point parents are , like , pulling their children close .
you can &apos;t fix that problem without addressing shame , because when they teach those folks how to suture , they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful .
it is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles .
it &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
but you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters ? &quot;
brené brown : listening to shame
we have a split wing .
he started this with no money .
and then , with all these results , the doctor makes a final diagnosis , and then prescribes a line of treatment , and if they need a pair of glasses , they are available right there at the camp site , usually under a tree .
the revenues increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy margin while you &apos;re treating a large number of people for free .
it is ourselves we are healing .
so if i download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well , they could be thin , right -- but if it has 500 pages , i want to feel that &quot; harry potter &quot; -- it &apos;s thick .
so , that &apos;s very intuitive , and that &apos;s what we want .
it showed that an arts practice can remake one &apos;s identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar .
this year , whole earth catalog has a supplement that i &apos;ll preview today , called whole earth discipline .
cable tv , water , the whole gamut , all gets stolen .
we should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world , because if we don &apos;t , they will go toward the criminal world .
people get into town .
so and then when you compare the lifetime emissions of these various energy forms , nuclear is about even with solar and wind , and ahead of solar -- oh , i &apos;m sorry -- with hydro and wind , and ahead of solar .
despite their best efforts , genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history .
there was so much ice in 1992 , the following year , that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs who were known as the pinatubo cubs .
i &apos;ve been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the gulf of mexico , because i &apos;m canadian , and i can draw no ancestral ties .
a range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now , like &quot; greed . &quot;
it is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do .
it means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal , the likes of which we haven &apos;t yet seen .
but , of course , our secular religion is technology .
nice show . man , that was good !
bf : first try ? once on purpose ?
dh : wow , you &apos;ve been working out .
dh : wow ! boy !
or a virgin for a sacrifice ?
dh : whenever you &apos;re ready .
bf : nice .
dh : whenever you &apos;re ready there , big guy .
every one of these circles is a cog , a stack of cogs , and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive .
you &apos;re not just going to have that , so , first of all , you had sound . you had a bell , so if anything went wrong — — or the machine needed the attendant to come to it , there was a bell it could ring .
when you say she &apos;s a programmer , she did do some , but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much , much more than this .
but in between that we &apos;re going to do a simulation .
and so just to give you a picture of what this looks like , the human genome project : 3 gigabases , right .
so unfortunately , this doesn &apos;t help this woman , but it does have severe , profound if you will , implications to her family .
and what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five , 10 , 20 years just because of this one thing .
so anybody who &apos;s here today with your significant other , just turn over to them and swab their mouth , send it to the lab and you &apos;ll know for sure .
richard resnick : welcome to the genomic revolution
and our team members developed this technology .
unlike us , a hyper-intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics .
but physics does tell us what particles can be produced .
but if we plot them out according to their charges , some beautiful patterns emerge .
in a strong interaction , a strong force particle , such as this one , interacts with a colored quark , such as this green one , to give a quark with a different color charge -- this red one .
however , if we work in eight-dimensional charge space , then we can assign unique new charges to each particle .
and as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the large hadron collider , we may be able to see whether nature uses this e8 pattern or a different one .
that &apos;s right . the reason it &apos;s got a few people at least excited is because , if you &apos;re right , it brings gravity and quantum theory together .
you hear it going from one side of the valley to the other , from one group of nests to the next .
unfortunately , they , like us , have a dark side to their nature .
what &apos;s happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages , instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way , many of the staff are now tanzanian -- but when we began the tacare program , it was a tanzanian team going into the villages .
the mangroves are being cut down ; the effects of things like the tsunami get worse .
and every group chooses , between them , three different kinds of project to make this a better world , recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other .
do we care about the planet for our children ?
so i &apos;m really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again , with everyone at ted .
they had not slept .
we need to strengthen k-12 .
every foundation makes the difference in the next level .
whether you &apos;re talking about artists producing artists or you &apos;re talking about people getting into the social sciences , whatever the discipline -- and especially in science and engineering , as in art , for example -- you need scientists to pull the students into the work .
many students , k-12 and in universities , don &apos;t want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk .
i turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations .
whenever possible , refuse single-use and disposable plastics .
but if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors .
in this case , the student is interested in cameras , etc .
aicha el-wafi : good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
but we were all so nervous .
phyllis rodriguez and aicha el-wafi have a powerful friendship born of unthinkable loss . rodriguez &apos; son was killed in the world trade center attacks on september 11 , 2001 ; el-wafi &apos;s son zacarias moussaoui was convicted of a role in those attacks and is serving a life sentence . in hoping to find peace , these two moms have come to understand and respect one another .
before lifesaver , the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about 200 nanometers .
today i &apos;m going to use a jug just to show you all . let &apos;s get a bit of that poo in there .
diseases spread . more resources are required .
it was said to echo in churchill &apos;s brain in the 1930s .
and if it is therefore the case , as i believe it is , that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power , then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space .
but that &apos;s not a usual case in history .
the west got together -- the bretton woods institution , world bank , international monetary fund -- the problem solved .
because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself , nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory , because the effects outside the nation state are now beginning to affect what happens inside them .
and so suddenly , ladies and gentlemen , what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy .
well , our approach to finding longevity was to team up with national geographic , and the national institute on aging , to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined .
it &apos;s a little bit like the days when we all had beatles albums or eagles albums and we &apos;d make a copy of that on a cassette tape , and let our friends copy that cassette tape , and pretty soon , with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage .
they have what we want .
typically in america we &apos;ve divided our adult life up into two sections .
this is a heterogeneous community .
i &apos;m probably the only person you &apos;ll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the sahara desert without sunscreen .
they tend to eat a plant-based diet .
in the case of this little example i &apos;m holding , we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light .
the biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment .
catarina mota : play with smart materials
stop looking where you &apos;re going , turn , check your blind spot , and drive down the road without looking where you &apos;re going .
that guy &apos;s been on the road probably for the last half hour .
that guy could be a problem .
those of you who know me know how passionate i am about opening the space frontier .
well , we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this .
x prize founder peter diamandis talks about how he helped stephen hawking fulfill his dream of going to space -- by flying together into the upper atmosphere and experiencing weightlessness at zero g .
this little guy is called the kinesin , and he pulls a sack that &apos;s full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it &apos;s needed in the cell -- whether it &apos;s to a membrane , whether it &apos;s to an organelle , whether it &apos;s to build something or repair something .
and i sweated .
then the professor listened to my story and he said , &quot; you have a job . you have hope .
and i &apos;m not here to be the poster girl for the homeless .
no , we decided to do a bit more .
and the kids were doing it in school too .
you could call it the coca-cola approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing .
and then we went down one more step .
so you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people .
otherwise they &apos;ll never get out of poverty .
thailand &apos;s &quot; mr. condom , &quot; mechai viravaidya , walks us through the country &apos;s bold plan to raise its standard of living , starting in the 1970s . first step : population control . and that means a lot of frank , funny -- and very effective -- talk about condoms . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so i can see everything that romo sees , and i get a robot &apos;s-eye-view of the world .
that girl can take her iphone , put it on the robot , send an email to grandma , who lives on the other side of the country .
there &apos;s a jewish saying that i love .
heart is what drives us and determines our fate .
she walked elegantly , like a giraffe on the african savannah , holding the flag on her shoulder . i jogged behind -- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm , so that my head was actually under the damn flag .
we had a memorable fight . feminism is dated ?
it is so swollen that you can &apos;t even see the eyes .
they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power , in the voluminous botero style .
and as more of us move into cities , more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it &apos;s soybean fields in mato grosso in brazil -- in order to feed us .
this is no accident , because agriculture and cities are bound together . they need each other .
everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port .
it used to be a social event , buying and selling food .
it can either mean a good place , or no place .
we need to be thinking more about permaculture , which is why i think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing .
some of these will sound familiar because you probably are thinking that way . i &apos;m using my brain theory to see .
so they &apos;re smart , but poor .
the twist is that one player , on the left , is informed about how much on each trial there is .
very complicated . the right brain schematic is the uninformed person , and the left is the informed .
this is a young chimp . the young ones are better than the old ones , just like humans .
now they get three apple cubes .
something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence .
and i want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate compassionate thinking .
weeks from the charter for compassion launch , karen armstrong looks at religion &apos;s role in the 21st century : will its dogmas divide us ? or will it unite us for common good ? she reviews the catalysts that can drive the world &apos;s faiths to rediscover the golden rule .
and i began to think about how i could communicate this in book form .
over the spanish steps we go .
waiter catches on , but it &apos;s too late .
now that &apos;s one drawing , so i thought maybe it &apos;s time for piranesi to meet escher .
&quot; pigeon &apos;s progress &quot; struck me as a catchy title .
and it becomes necessary and possible , at this point , to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving .
i believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling , replicating and repairing themselves .
each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that , checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor .
so you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one .
recently i visited beloit , wisconsin .
the first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information .
thank you .
it &apos;s so dark that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you , and that star were to explode as a supernova , and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you , you still wouldn &apos;t be able to see even a glimmer .
that physical objects , as unlike each other as they could possibly be , can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time .
in those galaxies , you &apos;ll be able to do astrophysics , and learn the laws of physics .
now the lesson of that seems clear to me , and i don &apos;t know why it isn &apos;t informing public debate .
what kinds of rules ?
when they separated , they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules .
in the 1950s , hong kong was a place where millions of people could go , from the mainland , to start in jobs like sewing shirts , making toys .
the city can be built .
they want to get out .
their kids can get an education .
if we can keep innovating on our space of rules , and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules , so we don &apos;t get stuck with bad rules , then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place , so that people like nelson and his friends don &apos;t have to study any longer under the streetlights . thank you .
the other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light , and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence .
but it turns out the environment is very critical for this , and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what &apos;s in the environment .
this is derived from an organism , deinococcus radiodurans , that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed .
we delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species .

maps matter .
so what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment .
so if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements , which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back .
how do you remember where you parked your car ? how do you know if you &apos;re moving in the right direction ? neuroscientist neil burgess studies the neural mechanisms that map the space around us , and how they link to memory and imagination .
but very , very few people or organizations know why they do what they do .
all i did was reverse the order of the information .
it &apos;s also responsible for all human behavior , all decision-making , and it has no capacity for language .

so health leads was born of these conversations -- a simple model where doctors and nurses can prescribe nutritious food , heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they prescribe medication .
it &apos;s just a set of choices that people make .
but mostly we all just sit there forever , waiting .
so mia lozada is chief resident of internal medicine at ucsf medical center , but for three years as an undergraduate she was a health leads volunteer in the clinic waiting room at boston medical center .
rebecca onie : what if our healthcare system kept us healthy ?
it &apos;s a $ 10-billion-a-year discontinuity in the global transport system .
we also see a very strong insurgency embedded there .
they are hospital ships .
it &apos;s a perfect evocation of that great population survey , the six largest nations in the world in descending order : china , india , facebook , the united states , twitter and indonesia .
my thesis for you is that by combining international , interagency , private-public , strategic communication , together , in this 21st century , we can create the sum of all security .
