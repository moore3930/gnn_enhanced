we have great examples of that , unfortunately .
there &apos;s other ways of breaking the pyramid .
in 2009 , the picture is dramatically different .
we &apos;re living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24-hour business , shift work .
an actor struggles to die onstage , but a puppet has to struggle to live .
ak : it &apos;s about a boy who falls in love with a horse .
and we sent it off to the national theatre , hoping that they believed that we created something that worked .
joey , come here .
ak : you want to say something about the breathing ?
so we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly .
this is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
the third category is represented by warren buffet , which i call aggregated giving .
if we don &apos;t develop the stamina to stick with things -- whatever it is you pick , stick with it -- all of this stuff is just going to be , you know , a fad .
i keep this photograph close by to me -- it &apos;s in my office -- because i &apos;ve always felt a mystical connection to these two men , both of whom i never knew .
academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists , but fundamentally people chat with two , three , four -- anyway , less than five .
but what is really exceptional is the setting .
people have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations .
i find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like head start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future .
and if anyone should be clinging to the former glory of the coal mining history , and of the town , it should be judy .
and i just find it so bizarre that she &apos;s suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from .
fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs -- but after many years , the city wanted to build a jail .
and i call it &quot; hometown security . &quot;
so i &apos;m not that unhappy about that .
we need to work together to embrace and repair our land , repair our power systems and repair ourselves .
if you look at the picture , you &apos;ll see they &apos;re stacked up .
whether we sell , it doesn &apos;t make any difference whatsoever .
most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design , cheap labor , cheap components , and making a cheap laptop .
he did do it . the tender had nothing in it that related to us , nothing specific about sunlight-readable , mesh-network , low-power , but just a vanilla laptop proposal .
and we hope if you have eg two years from now , or whenever you have it again , i won &apos;t have bad breath , and i will be invited back , and will have , hopefully by then , maybe 100 million out there to children .
and window farmers in finland have been customizing their window farms for the dark days of the finnish winters by outfitting them with led grow lights that they &apos;re now making open source and part of the project .
on the right there is another robot doll , who you could get a couple of years ago .
but we had to make it fairly robust , much more robust than the robots we build in our labs .
but robots like this , they &apos;re a little hard to program .
it looks for highly saturated colors , from toys .
you &apos;re such a cute little robot .
robot : oh , cool .
and the second question is , will the machines want to take over ?
one of the most early work was done in automotive design -- some very exciting work was done there .
everybody likes it , but some like it more than others .
i watch what people do .
so a lot of it tends to be extrinsic .
it &apos;s not about the shapes , it &apos;s how the shapes reflect light .
so that &apos;s okay , isn &apos;t it ?
and the great thing is , this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it &apos;s green technology and it &apos;s good for you and it &apos;s light and it &apos;s all part of the future .
what aspects of religion should atheists adopt ? alain de botton suggests a &quot; religion for atheists &quot; -- call it atheism 2.0 -- that incorporates religious forms and traditions to satisfy our human need for connection , ritual and transcendence .
education is going to give us , not only commercial skills , industrial skills , it &apos;s also going to make us better people .
so get on your knees and repeat it . &quot;
so if you go to an african american pentecostalist church in the american south and you listen to how they talk , my goodness , they talk well .
that &apos;s why a very common feeling when you &apos;re in a museum -- let &apos;s admit it -- is , &quot; i don &apos;t know what this is about . &quot;
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists , the poets -- are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
atheism shouldn &apos;t cut itself off from the rich sources of religion .
carved above their door is , &quot; free to all . &quot;
i think that &apos;s one of the reasons why the kindle is so great .
so the books were in the library . we could get it to people , if they &apos;re digitized , but we didn &apos;t know how to quite get them digitized .
the chinese did over a million , and the egyptians are about 30,000 .
and we &apos;re starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright into the out-of-print world .
the rock &apos; n &apos; rollers had a tradition of sharing , as long as nobody made any money . you could -- concert recordings , it &apos;s not the commercial recordings , but concert recordings , started by the grateful dead .
so anyway , television is , i would suggest , within our grasp .
and as i said before , i &apos;ll end with something that &apos;s carved above the door of the carnegie library .
and most of the experiments , telescopes that i went to see are in some way addressing this question , these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy .
and the line of black dots that you see in the background , that &apos;s the ice camp where the physicists are working .
the reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert .
and that process takes about two hours .

this is the agriculture .
we had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost .
they also pollute their next-door neighbors .
it also connects us in time .
and there are actually more species of bees than there are mammals and birds combined .
in another part of the same story , all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark , so birds , livestock and wild animals .
this is interesting because this sleeping machinery , it &apos;s perfectly conserved .
because they evolved for the same reason : to survive predation .
i &apos;m trying to do this in english .
but actually i did .
you whistle the same tone as me .
they think this is the funniest thing they &apos;ve ever seen before .
a high school kid in texas wrote me in 2006 and said , &quot; you should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a best buy and stand around . &quot;
or listening to the same mp3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park , or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical , or diving into the ocean in coney island wearing formal attire .
to test water , you simply insert a sample and , within seconds , it either displays a red light , indicating contaminated water , or a green light , indicating the sample is safe .

it needs the help of mother , or a foster mother , to survive .
what they have sweated so far has no meaning .
in spite of a very tragic life , one is happy in moments which are very few and far between .
when you relate to the world , the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is , what we say , love .
you &apos;ll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion , and slowly , perhaps if you get the right teaching , you &apos;ll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself , which is oneness , wholeness , and that &apos;s what you are .
for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics .
now i am making films .
it brought a lot of attention to all those iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy .
they told me that one of their residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things , and they wondered if she &apos;d gone bonkers or , because she was an old lady , whether she &apos;d had a stroke , or whether she had alzheimer &apos;s .
she said she didn &apos;t recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations .
he &apos;d had cataract surgery .
a lot of them had to do with a car .
there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations .
around 1970 , it was found that there were not only parts of the brain , but particular cells .
finally , i think they are infinitely interesting and valuable , for giving one some insight as to how the brain works .
the khan academy is most known for its collection of videos , so before i go any further , let me show you a little bit of a montage .
you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin , without feeling like they &apos;re wasting my time .
assuming he was good . we don &apos;t know .
in a traditional classroom , you have a couple of homework , homework , lecture , homework , lecture , and then you have a snapshot exam .
it &apos;s like one plus one is equal to two .
now i come from a very data-centric reality , so we don &apos;t want that teacher to even go and intervene and have to ask the kid awkward questions : &quot; oh , what do you not understand ? &quot; or &quot; what do you do understand ? &quot;
in our mind , the relevant metric is student-to-valuable-human-time- with-the-teacher ratio .
sk : los altos , it was kind of crazy .
no , no reason why it really can &apos;t happen in every classroom in america tomorrow .
and the first thing you &apos;re going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across .
that chin barbel is flashing .

so dna &apos;s entering the production line from the left-hand side , and it hits this collection , these miniature biochemical machines , that are pulling apart the dna strand and making an exact copy .

everything that &apos;s cased in blue is an area where we &apos;ve taken imagery on the ground as well .
so , we &apos;re going to head over to the dumpsters , where it &apos;s traditional , after a long day at the market , to go out for a break , but also stare up at the sky .

jose antonio abreu : my dear friends , ladies and gentlemen , i am overjoyed today at being awarded the ted prize on behalf of all the distinguished music teachers , artists and educators from venezuela who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years in founding , growing and developing in venezuela the national system of youth and children &apos;s orchestras and choirs .

and another advantage , of course , of using fingers is you have 10 of them .
each frame of the movie has information about itself .
that child was very articulate and showed us and even dealt with the things he couldn &apos;t do automatically with that manual . it was just absolutely fantastic . &quot;
but rooted in that , little did she know how much knowledge she was acquiring about geometry and just math and logic and all the rest .
because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it .
and it &apos;s the whole field that we &apos;ve been trying to work on for the last 10 years at intel .
this is a map of the entire world .
and it was reflected in our architecture , it was reflected in the way that we taught students , and this mainframe mentality persists today .
how do we get a personal baseline about what &apos;s going to work for you ?
there is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play kind of legos that you can do to capture , in the wild , in the real world , things like tremor , gait , stride length and those kinds of things .
we need to drive a national , if not international , framingham-type heart study of independent living technologies , where we have 10,000 elderly connected households with broadband , full medical characterization , and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies that the universities fund , to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies .
and i have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests , the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones .
but this one died at the age of 16 .
&quot; fix the chicken . &quot;
we want to stop that tail from resorbing .
if they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you .
and the way the internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places , and this one processor , because of a broken card , decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time .
so i think that , if people understand how much we &apos;re starting to depend on the internet , and how vulnerable it is , we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist , and i think if enough people say , &quot; yeah , i would like to use it , i &apos;d like to have such a system , &quot; then it will get built .
now , as humans , we make maps of places that we seldom even go , which seems a little wasteful of time .
that &apos;s a little more flowing . hikuleo sounds like a kind of a leonardo dicaprio 17 syllable thing .
the first consideration , make it clear , simple and unambiguous .

what i &apos;m going to try and do now is to square , in my head , four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators , even using the shortcut method .
457 squared is 205,849 .
now , i would attempt to square a five-digit number -- and i can -- but unfortunately most calculators cannot .
i think you left out the number 3 ?
february what ? audience : sixth .

clifford stoll captivates his audience with a wildly energetic sprinkling of anecdotes , observations , asides -- and even a science experiment . after all , by his own definition , he &apos;s a scientist : &quot; once i do something , i want to do something else . &quot;
having said that , i outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
just two weeks ago i made -- you know , i &apos;ve been making small , medium and big klein bottles for the trade .
i realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
and that &apos;s one of the things i thought i &apos;d do right now .
but , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink -- we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to -- not bad . pretty good .
i &apos;m looking out and i &apos;m seeing the cops bashing students &apos; heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .

i know i don &apos;t need it .
and norbert rosing , a german photographer , is there on scene , making a series of photos of these huskies , who are tethered .
and this image is , for humans , the beginning point of play .
and social play is part of what we &apos;re about here today , and is a byproduct of the play scene .
and this is one of the ways you can study play -- is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram .
and you can trust it .
and although i think he certainly had the capacity for play -- because i do know something about that -- he wasn &apos;t as empowered , i think , as he now is by paying attention to what is his own passion and his own inner drive , which i think has its basis in all of us in our play history .
stuart brown : so i would encourage you all to engage not in the work-play differential -- where you set aside time to play -- but where your life becomes infused minute by minute , hour by hour , with body , object , social , fantasy , transformational kinds of play .
i mean you don &apos;t hear about anything that &apos;s like cancer or heart disease associated with play .
the reality is that covering britney is cheaper .
br : that &apos;s not it , though .
virus hunter nathan wolfe is outwitting the next pandemic by staying two steps ahead : discovering deadly new viruses where they first emerge -- passing from animals to humans among poor subsistence hunters in africa -- before they claim millions of lives .
and so we &apos;ve been studying people like this individual .
they show us filter paper they &apos;ve used to collect the animals &apos; blood .
we have a whole range of challenges about this work .
that gave us a tremendous amount of hope .
golan levin , an artist and engineer , uses modern tools -- robotics , new software , cognitive research -- to make artworks that surprise and delight . watch as sounds become shapes , bodies create paintings , and a curious eye looks back at the curious viewer .
so again , people discover their creative agency in this way .
and in this project we &apos;ve developed a form of intelligent real-time subtitles .
there is just a little test screen that shows that it &apos;s working .
i &apos;m at carnegie mellon ; we &apos;ve got a great robotics institute there .
one of the guys i hired was an engineer named jack dorsey , and a year later we were trying to decide which way to go with odeo , and jack presented an idea he &apos;d been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends .
twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium : you send one message and it goes out to everybody , and you receive the messages you &apos;re interested in .
it &apos;s totally intimidating .

what if my roommate knew about contemporary nigerian music , talented people singing in english and pidgin , and igbo and yoruba and ijo , mixing influences from jay-z to fela to bob marley to their grandfathers .
we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives , and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions .
but what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps , that within these camps , a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition , that experts move with the prevailing winds , often hero-worshipping their own gurus .
it seems that they &apos;ve somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world &apos;s population are women .

we saw earlier that hiv is highly variable , that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus .
so far , animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease , although you might get a mild case .

daniel didn &apos;t get anything about the protests in egypt at all in his first page of google results .
in a broadcast society -- this is how the founding mythology goes -- in a broadcast society , there were these gatekeepers , the editors , and they controlled the flows of information .
i &apos;ve got brown eyes ; you might have blue or gray .
and so now you can see why i proposed this hypothesis : i am my connectome .
in the 17th century , the mathematician and philosopher , blaise pascal , wrote of his dread of the infinite , his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space .
and with the stream , i would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity .
philosophers know this game very well .

zk : as we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about how you could apply these , or how they &apos;re being applied currently -- he was telling us that , in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed -- and then , when they &apos;re out on the field , erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base .
all right , well thanks for coming up .
now , to think about the potential for this , think of all the places ink is supplied : on business cards , on the back of cereal boxes , board games . any place you use ink , you could change the way you interact with it .
ks : so that was the six we had for you today , but i hope you &apos;re starting to see why we find these things so fascinating .

that is , until i went to eduardo &apos;s farm in extremadura , 50 miles north of seville , right on the portugal border .
so he got rid of the electricity , he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside , so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators .
bright yellow .
imagine -- i don &apos;t know , imagine a hog farm in , like , north carolina , and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and decides to stay .
with eduardo it &apos;s about the expression of nature .
mega-farms , feed lots , chemical amendments , long-distance travel , food processing .

and i remembered a line from the mahabharata , the great indian epic : &quot; what is the most wondrous thing in the world , yudhisthira ? &quot;
but first , compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering .
another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what &apos;s called neural integration .

i was doing a pathetically slow speed of about 1.3 knots , and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4 : it was like two snails in a mating dance .
and then that story changed .
and it &apos;s very difficult to be happy on a planet that &apos;s racked with famine and drought .
this is a guy named carlos finlay . he had a hypothesis that was way outside the box for his time , in the late 1800s .
we just have better statistics .
and it &apos;s getting worse .
and there &apos;s been a lot of talk about commonses , right , here , there , everywhere , right . a commons is nothing more than a public good that we build out of private goods .
and if you &apos;d like to build corporate structures on top of it , that &apos;s okay too . that &apos;s all in the consent , so if you don &apos;t like those terms , you don &apos;t come in .
it &apos;s a beautiful song written by a guy called martin evan , boo hewerdine , thomas dolby , thank you very much for inviting me . it &apos;s been a blessing singing for you .
at the point where you can weaponize your buildings , you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way .
everyone here must own one , or at least they craved one the moment they saw one .
it doesn &apos;t see any excess cost . it doesn &apos;t spend any extra time .
now , lest you think that this is only for the light at heart , or just temporary installations , this is the same firm working at the world trade center , replacing the bridge that used to go across west street , that very important pedestrian connection between the city of new york and the redevelopment of the west side .
in the guardian tower of new york , converted to a w union square -- i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the union square into the building itself .
well , there &apos;s analog and digital . thought that was appropriate here .
for example , you could plot the flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem , or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in yosemite national park .
okay , some of you are looking a little bit skeptical .
and number five : i wish i &apos;d lived a life true to my dreams , instead of what others expected of me .
my doctor told me that in order to heal my brain , i had to rest it .
that lasted for more than a year , and it was the hardest year of my life by far .
now , does this sound familiar ?
don &apos;t give up .
looking good , looking good .
margaret wertheim leads a project to re-create the creatures of the coral reefs using a crochet technique invented by a mathematician -- celebrating the amazements of the reef , and deep-diving into the hyperbolic geometry underlying coral creation .
and then some people in chicago came along and they said , &quot; in late 2007 , the theme of the chicago humanities festival is global warming . and we &apos;ve got this 3,000 square-foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef . &quot;
why not chisel a coral reef out of marble ?
it &apos;s a definition really of euclidean space .
then our mathematicians come along and said , &quot; there &apos;s this thing called a sphere , and the lines come together at the north and south pole . &quot;
it turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders .

this picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about 100 patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky .
we depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure .
in fact , some years ago , bill joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over , etc .
as i should have shown this earlier , it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun ; it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria .
or will the biosphere stabilize ?
maybe it &apos;s something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics .
ss : this is kanzi and i , in the forest .
it means &quot; star &quot; in swahili .
now she comes up to dr. sue and starts writing again .
dr. sue thinks it &apos;s important to allow such curiosity to flourish .
&lt; transcript &gt;
they basically went out on a date , and he says at the end that he didn &apos;t &quot; achieve &quot; her up till now .
so we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team .
last year here at ted i asked you to give me your data , to put your data on the web , on the basis that if people put data onto the web -- government data , scientific data , community data , whatever it is -- it will be used by other people to do wonderful things , in ways that they never could have imagined .
here focusing in on haiti .
but just three days later , on a day they called red monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their sputnik rocket as an ibm missile .
my name is joshua walters .
so it wasn &apos;t all the good side of the illness .
it extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos .
each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers .
now , your pacemaker is not a single cell .
you &apos;re used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top .
think of the bridge as being like this platform .
they &apos;re all having some difficulty walking .
now , imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a great dane .
so it &apos;s not necessary , thank god , that the fowler apple is the best apple in the world .
it &apos;s two breeding cycles for maize .
in this place there .
we need to collect the remaining diversity that &apos;s out there .
this is male blogging posture sitting , and the result is , men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women , when working on laptop .
and then our next talk , our next ted if you invite me will be why you should not carry a cell phone in your pocket .
and i think that the inspiration begins when you &apos;re very young : three-year-olds , up to 12- , 14-year-olds .
and there &apos;s a lot of them that i actually can &apos;t show you on this chart .
we know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now , do it safe enough -- at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done .
paul allen , elan musk , richard branson , jeff bezos , the ansari family , which is now funding the russians &apos; sub-orbital thing , bob bigelow , a private space station , and carmack .
i think what we &apos;ll do is we &apos;ll see a successful , very successful , private space flight industry . whether we &apos;re first or not really doesn &apos;t matter .
and these are the vessels of life , and , as i &apos;ll show you , they can also be the vessels of death .
and , in fact , cancers don &apos;t start out with a blood supply .
so , a few years ago , i asked myself , &quot; can we take this one step further and treat other cancers , even in other species ? &quot;
so i started asking myself , &quot; why haven &apos;t we been able to do better ? &quot;
so here are four different teas that we &apos;ve tested .
and , in fact , some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines .
and there are many clinical trials .
you can create one out of legos .
well , let &apos;s first of all simplify the vases illusion , make the thing on the right .
everybody now considers themselves a creator , and not just a viewer .
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl .
i want to say that i think the powers that be know that empire-building is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building .
but i also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24 , they are they key , really , in the developing world , as well as in the whole world , to the future of humanity .
and through her self-defense , she grabbed their adam &apos;s apples , she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car .
agnes took her in , and agnes loved her , and agnes supported her for the year .
i &apos;m an emotional creature ! &quot;
i know that one kiss could take away all my decision-making ability .
and this blew his mind . literally . he checked into a sanitarium .
so i got a fulbright scholarship to just travel around africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals , which is a great job if you can get it .
and i started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
and i measured out the lengths of straw , put it on a log-log plot , got the scaling exponent , and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook .
george boole took leibniz &apos;s binary code and created boolean algebra , and john von neumann took boolean algebra and created the digital computer .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so if i put this inside this water here , you can see a silver reflective coating around it , and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that &apos;s protecting the water from touching the paddle , and it &apos;s dry .
and then the pilot didn &apos;t go and i was so sad , but i kept remaining a fan of yours .
sobule : i sing . sweeney : i tell stories . together : the jill and julia show . sobule : sometimes it works . sweeney : sometimes it doesn &apos;t . together : the jill and julia , the jill and julia , the jill and julia show . &lt; / transcript &gt;
mt : his great idea was alternating current .
we are still asking the question .
what we discovered was that two- , four- , six- and eight-legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move .
it just bends by itself beautifully .
rf : here &apos;s it going down a pathway .
there &apos;s the bulldozer version . now , it doesn &apos;t use pressure-sensitive glue .
so , in conclusion , i think the message is clear .
but it was kind of an interesting thought .
190 heads of state -- nine are women .
what are the messages we tell our daughters ?
you don &apos;t know anything . &quot;
this is the complication .
i think there &apos;s a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking -- and i see this all the time -- with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving .
thank you .
even from the same maker or based on the same model .
it &apos;s a problem that manifests itself in diabetes , obesity , many forms of heart disease , even some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking .
they had a low-fear population , where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation , all based in science , but told them that , if you didn &apos;t brush and floss your teeth , you could get gum disease . if you get gum disease , you will lose your teeth , but you &apos;ll get dentures , and it won &apos;t be that bad .
except , maybe we do .
you &apos;ve seen them all around , especially these days as radars are cheaper .
who among us would actually say that people read this ?
they &apos;re packed with information .
so that &apos;s our general blood work test .
quest diagnostics and labcorp , the two largest lab testing companies -- last year , they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively .
and this information is out there .
and that bee , no doubt , assumed that it had decided , &quot; i &apos;m going for that apple tree , i &apos;m going for that blossom , i &apos;m going to get the nectar and i &apos;m going to leave . &quot;
which is , does it make us better citizens of the biotic community ?
and that &apos;s really what i do as a writer , as a storyteller , is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually help us think ecologically .
and the reason he &apos;s waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day , those larvae will hatch and he &apos;ll have a huge fly problem .
and what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species , take account of the soil , that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea -- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences , which are so cheap they could be all over africa in no time -- that we can take the food we need from the earth and actually heal the earth in the process .
but i thought it &apos;d be neat for the square to respond to me , and my kids were small then , and my kids would play with these things , like , &quot; aaah , &quot; you know , they would say , &quot; daddy , aaah , aaah . &quot; you know , like that .
so you might want to , for instance , get a heads-up display on how you &apos;re interacting with them .
there we are in monterey -- hopefully i can get it right .
they run google ads , and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know .
but it &apos;s just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes .
and so that &apos;s basically what we &apos;ve done since we instituted that a few years ago , and i think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well-organized .
and these ads are generated automatically -- like in this case , on the washington post -- from the content on the site .
i wanted to end just by saying that there &apos;s a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with google , and one of those is that we &apos;re able to make money largely through advertising , and one of the benefits that i didn &apos;t expect from that was that we &apos;re able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about , you know , places that don &apos;t have as much money .
if you &apos;re not , too bad . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
but this could also be used for good .
this is used all over the place , including linkedin , where i am an un-whole individual .
it &apos;s also used in things like mcdonald &apos;s monopoly , where the game is not the monopoly game you &apos;re playing , but the sort of cottage industries that form to try and find boardwalk , right .
important ? not so very .
it may integrate technology and economics , but it starts with what humans need , or might need .
so william beveridge , when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942 , created what became britain &apos;s welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well-being .
we teamed designers and investment experts up with 11 water organizations across india .
&quot; i understand , &quot; i said , &quot; that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea , but i &apos;d like to put some sugar in my green tea . &quot;
the first group came in , and they were greeted by miss smith , who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles .
so bring it on , walmart , with 100,000 different products , and amazon , with 27 million books and match.com with -- what is it ? -- 15 million date possibilities now .
we do not need everything that is there . &quot;
right outside chicago , a young couple , susan and daniel mitchell , were about to have their first baby .
in her essay , &quot; the white album , &quot; joan didion writes , &quot; we tell ourselves stories in order to live .
thank you .
so as far as i can tell , a rose by any other name probably does look different and maybe even smells different .
what if the entire boat becomes a point of control ?
we have the people so we need to protect each other , yes , and we &apos;re a technology company , and profit is necessary to make this happen .
that &apos;s when i leave graduate school , and i can &apos;t work in new york on kind of entertainment and technology because i have to be exiled to california , where the remaining jobs are , almost to the sea , to go to work for apple computer .
but it gives you the kind of power that people have , that the audience has , and the reasons these transformations are happening .
it &apos;s the era of big business and data centers for computing .
that &apos;s like a dick cheney speech .
but it &apos;s not a joke . this is a real headline .
and i used three criteria : the first was , i thought i &apos;d talk about real design within reach , design that &apos;s free , not design not quite within reach , as we &apos;re fondly known by our competition and competitors , but stuff that you can find on the streets , stuff that was free , stuff that was available to all people , and stuff that probably contains some other important messages .
i find these little vignettes , these little accidental pieces of design , to be refreshing .
i &apos;ve often wondered why italy is really a leader in modern design .
we go there for stimulation in art and all those other things .
but this was real romance to me .
and i went into art because they appreciated drawing .
and the loose ideas had something to do with what i knew happened with people in the office , at the work place -- people who worked , and used task seating , a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long .
so i spent a long time .
and you need it in a different position when you &apos;re upright , then when you &apos;re reclined .
because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
they manufacture plastics . they use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
there are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
these programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information i &apos;ve shared here with you today .
hang left at cranky , right at preoccupied , u-turn on silent treatment , all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin &apos; .
we can interfere with the interface .
it &apos;s our prejudgment that it &apos;s underground .
they &apos;re going to eddy in lagos .
what i thought i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that &apos;s tracked by architecture .
so , symmetry wasn &apos;t the sign of order and organization -- which is what i was always understanding , and as is an architect -- symmetry was the absence of information .
it turns out it &apos;s not rocket science to design a sacred space .
so , we designed a system here of eight curves that could be swapped , very similar to that housing project i showed you , and we could recombine those together , so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way .
but again , you can see this , kind of , organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole , but breaks down into smaller parts , but in an incredibly organic way .
if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility , then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms .
so the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission , thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact , or person-food-person contact -- both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission .
you &apos;ve got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance , so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance .
like , you know , just as you get into the malaria zone , sub-saharan africa .
and actually , i spend as much of my time in clinic dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients as with the physical disability .
what do you do ?
muscles will amplify the nerve signals about a thousand-fold , so that we can record them from on top of the skin , like you saw earlier .
his brain is thinking about his arm .

boghuma kabisen titanji : ethical riddles in hiv research
also , research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty , endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems .
i think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended .
you could call it tedistan .
let &apos;s zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world , eastern eurasia .
again , like mongolia , china isn &apos;t conquering russia . it &apos;s just leasing it .
the asian free trade zone , almost free trade zone , that &apos;s emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the pacific .
the reason is kurdistan .
it even had an offshoot running to haifa in what is today israel , on the mediterranean sea .
silk road connotes independence and mutual trust .
so what &apos;s next ? where are we going to see borders change and new countries born ?
&lt; / transcript &gt;
but what is really amazing , because of this deepness here , emperor penguins can go down more than 500 meters and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes .
what i found out i was studying is really the difference in how the galapagos changes , the most extreme variation .
and also , we know that it &apos;s not only galapagos penguins that are in trouble , but magellanics and many other species of penguins .
so that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs , the other one is out there foraging , and the longer they have to stay gone , the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back .
so penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats .
it &apos;s a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what &apos;s happening .
it talks about the candidates -- written very well -- but no information , no follow-up , no websites for the campaigns , no information about when the debates are , where the campaign offices are .
charitable status : groups who have charitable status in canada aren &apos;t allowed to do advocacy .
but scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible .
you &apos;re going to see , in just two weeks , the normal worms are old .
okay , so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell ?
and just like any population , most of the people live to be about 70 or 80 , but some live to be 90 or 100 .
these animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do .
and there are certain forms of the foxo gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100 .
ck : ah , so the kinds of drugs i was talking about would not change the genes , they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity .
it &apos;s more like , say , if you were a dog .
but as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs , the gift of life was then extended from living , related donors to now living , unrelated donors .
and this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells .
i was about to start a robotic operation , but stepping out of the elevator into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room , i realized that my left visual field was fast collapsing into darkness .
as we speak , the world &apos;s first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway and in the u.k. , neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial .

i mean , josh rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things .
may god forgive you .
we see that there are palestinians who suffered a lot , who lost children , and still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation .
this amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together , to cross borders and have people feel like they &apos;re having a communal experience .
ladies and gentlemen , jehane noujaim .
so kaluza said to himself , einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space -- in fact , space and time , to be more precise .
in our era , a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself , many others around the world , it &apos;s called superstring theory , as you were indicating .
these are numbers like the mass of the particles , like electrons and quarks , the strength of gravity , the strength of the electromagnetic force -- a list of about 20 numbers that have been measured with incredible precision , but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do .
but here &apos;s how the experiment will go .
i was in copenhagen in december like a number of you in this room .
volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .
so that trip just ended , and i can &apos;t show you too many results from that right now , but we &apos;ll go back one more year , to another drilling expedition i &apos;ve been involved in .
and these plants need sunlight , so we know when we find that sediment there &apos;s no ice overhead .
when these things die , immediately , organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface .
imagine that .
we do similar things with ice cores .
the main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .
and to win this game , all you have to do is see the reality that &apos;s in front of you as it really is . all right ?
now , can any of you see the predator that &apos;s about to jump out at you ?
it &apos;s what we do with that information that matters .
now , when i tell you , i want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes .
so you see it that way .
the answer to this question is no .
and the answer to the question is no . those are actually blue flowers .
and this is one of those images .
the question is , &quot; is that an illusion ? &quot;
we &apos;re speaking about the fact that across the terrace , the next tower is the ministry of finance , and there &apos;s a lot of connection with us today , so we &apos;re speaking within your temple today . okay ?
so it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place .
people are telling us it &apos;s just like wall street . it &apos;s not just like wall street .
so in fact , you can &apos;t ask them anything , and they don &apos;t have to answer anything .
we have an integrity in public life act as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation &apos;s interest .
discard the first myth ; it is a crime .
and you can make your own decision , and then you &apos;ll decide whether the invasion was worth it .
one way to think of it is that we &apos;re highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in small family groups in the east african highlands in 100,000 b.c .
we respond to stories more than data .
enough real world examples helps .
we couldn &apos;t have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them .
so an example might be , if you go back 100 years ago when electricity was first becoming common , there were a lot of fears about it .
i have a very relativistic view of security .
we &apos;re terrible at models that span 80 years .
the second , more honest way is to actually fix the model .
it turns out when a baby &apos;s born now , they put an rfid bracelet on the baby , put a corresponding one on the mother , so if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward , an alarm goes off .
and people like us want to do things that destroy plants , and their habitats .
and they go back when their seeds have arrived .
so in habitats that have already been damaged , like the tall grass prairie here in the usa , or in mined land in various countries , restoration is already happening because of these species -- and because of this collection .
some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .
she should not go into banking , for example , or work at a cash register .
and then it was abandoned .
there &apos;s a point , you can stand here and see buildings by frank gehry , jean nouvel , shigeru ban , neil denari .
and we struggle with how to deal with them .
and sometimes military intervention is necessary .
and you don &apos;t have to agree when you sit down with the other side .
now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups .
we need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can take problem-solving forward .
the diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication .
this is a gentoo penguin . and she was still skeptical .
and , one thing that isn &apos;t a mystery , actually , was when i grew up -- because when i was a little kid , i &apos;d seen these pictures -- and i thought , &quot; well , why that look on the face ?
not a joke .
and these happen to be my eyes , by the way .
she is risking her professional life on something that her own calculations show may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever .
and there &apos;s some stuff poking out . so , you look at that , and you look up close , and you say , &quot; well , gee , that &apos;s kind of interesting . what are all of these pieces ? &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the orcas come , they &apos;re right by the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .

the illusion of speech follows incidentally .
at tedxusc , david logan talks about the five kinds of tribes that humans naturally form -- in schools , workplaces , even the driver &apos;s license bureau . by understanding our shared tribal tendencies , we can help lead each other to become better individuals .
but here is the point . if you believe and you say to people in your tribe , in effect , &quot; my life sucks .
stage four tribes can do remarkable things .
tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are .
danny hills makes a case for the next frontier of cancer research : proteomics , the study of proteins in the body . as hillis explains it , genomics shows us a list of the ingredients of the body -- while proteomics shows us what those ingredients produce . understanding what &apos;s going on in your body at the protein level may lead to a new understanding of how cancer happens .
so the list of ingredients does tell you something , and sometimes it tells you something that &apos;s wrong .
and in fact , thanks to kary mullis , you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients .
and applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems , and i didn &apos;t think this was a very likely one to call back , so i kept on giving him to the delay list .
and you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump , bump , bump , bump , bump .
we know that that works .
and it sounds silly , but that &apos;s basically what we do .
and so i believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future .
it is organic , across our religious , spiritual and ethical traditions , and yet it transcends them .

in a culture where being social and outgoing are prized above all else , it can be difficult , even shameful , to be an introvert . but , as susan cain argues in this passionate talk , introverts bring extraordinary talents and abilities to the world , and should be encouraged and celebrated .
shyness is about fear of social judgment .

in fact , personally , i &apos;ve never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money .
so , the good life is not about looking good , feeling good or having the goods ; it &apos;s about being good and doing good .
until you read the whole psalm , the whole chapter .
and god says , &quot; throw it down . &quot;
so it &apos;s a symbol of his identity , and it &apos;s a symbol of his income .
these things shape you .
because i really think , when i look back at how i actually ended up in this accident , technology played a big role in that .
and to me , that is very , very critical .
now , one of the things i &apos;d like to explain &#91; about &#93; 50x15 , which i think is really critical , is that it is not a charity .
those of you that might be familiar with mexico -- michoacan is a very colorful state .
it &apos;s got to be that someday i can look back , and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make .
thirty-one countries in total are involved , and in the case of uruguay , half the children already have them , and by the middle of 2009 , every single child in uruguay will have a laptop -- a little green laptop .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
i think this is a problem .
so this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
and she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? &quot;
that is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
the theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
so you take something like this , you burn it , you put it under pressure , and likely as not , you get this . although , again , i stress : we don &apos;t know .
last point , last graph . one of the things that we &apos;ve got to do is to stabilize oil prices . this is what oil prices look like , ok ?
well , my name of my company , joie de vivre -- so i started getting these letters from places like alabama and orange county saying to me that they were going to boycott my company because they thought we were a french company .
but the king was serious .
i like it .
he stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years , and he &apos;s loyal to the property because of the relationship that vivian and her fellow employees have created with him .
so oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem where there &apos;s a spill ; they &apos;re a problem where there &apos;s not .
i think in our minds we imagine somebody &apos;s going to take the little bottle , say , &quot; oh , little bottle .
and it &apos;s the idea that we don &apos;t have disposable anything .
that should be the goal .
well , when you start working on issues like plastic , you realize that the whole thing is connected , and luckily most of us are blessed to have two arms .
this is a little bit earlier version of it , that &apos;s why it &apos;s given the x designation , but it &apos;s a four-passenger aircraft that could take off vertically , like a helicopter -- therefore it doesn &apos;t need an airfield .
after all , i &apos;ve been spending 60 years here believing it &apos;s going to happen tomorrow .
a vertical-takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system -- that &apos;s essential .
if one of those fails , you still have a second chance .
eric giler demos wireless electricity
think about that .
and the other thing that &apos;s pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency .
how many people want to hang them on the wall ?
&lt; / transcript &gt;
i think there &apos;s a better solution .
these capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly , a kind of second skin , which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms .
but we want to use our brain !
we made it all freely available on the web , just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause .
yasheng huang : does democracy stifle economic growth ?
and you need a strong government to do that , because you cannot respect private property rights .
country 2 , that has fewer telephones , is china .
in fact , country a is democratic india , and country b is pakistan -- the country that has a long period of military rule .
china was during the cultural revolution .
it &apos;s very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern .
and they have increased the security with long-term land leases .
but i believe that india has the momentum .
and you can imagine what that would be like , right , in your own life -- and i know this is true of some of you -- if you were drinking all day , and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life , you would have better ideas .
a wonderful guy named timothy prestero , who has a company called ... an organization called design that matters .
this is hogarth &apos;s famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern , but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then .
and what gruber found was that darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany , reading malthus in october of 1838 .
and so guier and weiffenbach go back to weiffenbach &apos;s office , and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking , as we might call it now .
and now , i guarantee you certainly half of this room , if not more , has a device sitting in their pocket right now that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space .
but i mean , why would they respond to a 14-year-old , anyway ?
but then again , this fact that the metastases didn &apos;t go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely .
if those diseases where tissues are deteriorating -- for example alzheimer &apos;s , where the brain , the brain cells , die and we need to restore new brain cells , new functional brain cells -- what if we could , in the future , use cancer ? a tumor -- put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells ?
so there i was , i couldn &apos;t speak a word of korean , and this is the first night i met hyun-sook .
they would actually cover the windows every night , so that light couldn &apos;t be seen , because the south korean government has said for years that the north koreans may invade at any time .
because i hadn &apos;t told them what i was doing , because i was so upset with the story they &apos;d run .
i said , &quot; but you know , i bought an airline ticket , and i &apos;m stuck here for a week . &quot;
he had three women helping him take care of these kids .
so , my friend gene flew over with his son , tim .
so , we try to get to the door , and we run to the door , and we open the door and it &apos;s like walking into a blast furnace .
gene ended up using his coat , and his fist in the coat , to break open a liquor cabinet .
gene and gail know everyone in atlanta -- they &apos;re the most social couple imaginable .
and i always thought that was a very annie hall kind of outfit .
&quot; what is life ? what is the origin of life ?
but up until , literally , 15 years ago , that was all we knew about planets .
we can find what they &apos;re made of , would their atmospheres have water , carbon dioxide , methane .
and that deeper , underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it .
if that was the age of the universe , then this is the age of life on earth .
in asia , the first country to be heavily infected was thailand -- they reached one to two percent .
i will split tanzania in five income groups , from the highest income to the lowest income , and here we go .
vodka , midsummer &apos;s eve -- new partner for the fall .
one , the red line , is the ratio of british to indian per capita income .
and you know what , it was also being asked at roughly the same time by the resterners -- by the people in the rest of the world -- like ibrahim muteferrika , an ottoman official , the man who introduced printing , very belatedly , to the ottoman empire -- who said in a book published in 1731 , &quot; why do christian nations which were so weak in the past compared with muslim nations begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious ottoman armies ? &quot;
that is so right and so cool .
meanwhile , there &apos;s no scientific revolution anywhere else .
finally , the work ethic .
the second question is , does the sequencing of the download matter ?
thanks very much .
spiders are truly global citizens .
the frame and radii of this web is made up of one type of silk , while the capture spiral is a composite of two different silks : the filament and the sticky droplet .
this is the kind of sequence that i love looking at day and night .
the 21 species are indicated here by this phylogeny , this evolutionary tree , that shows their genetic relationships , and i &apos;ve colored in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders .
thank you .
delicious is a social bookmarking service .
and this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems .
you can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted . here &apos;s how heavily : if you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system , they account for three quarters of the photos taken -- just the top 10 percent most prolific photographers .
you can hire those people as employees , you can coordinate their work and you can get some output .
the fact that a single programmer can , without having to move into a professional relation to an institution , improve linux once and never be seen from again , should terrify ballmer .
that has sent the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization .
this is a social map of the hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the 9 / 11 attack .
because whole grain -- it &apos;s easy with white flour to make a good-tasting bread . white flour is sweet .
everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is &quot; mise en place , &quot; which is just a french way of saying , &quot; get organized . &quot;
proofing means to prove that the dough is alive .
but what &apos;s wheat ? wheat is a grass that grows in the field .
and we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call &quot; leaven . &quot;
it &apos;s starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is dough , what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive , comes out dead .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
i can understand the question , though . &quot; but is it music ? &quot;
so in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
the first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
there &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
and it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the reverend thomas bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
oh .
so what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
that technology is simulating humans .
the tricky bit is now to put an ai controller in it that actually makes it work .
we hired a team of physicists , software engineers and biologists to work on this , and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body , basically .
now , just a fun thing : what happens if you put that character -- this is now a wooden version of it , but it &apos;s got the same ai in it -- but if you put that character on a slippery surface , like ice .
i &apos;m not quite sure why , but we &apos;ve done it anyway .
but i particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds , like there , for example , that tom melcher has shown us .
thanks .
i have to tell you about my childhood .
and my argument &#91; is &#93; that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage .
and you &apos;ll get paid for it . you can think about it , if you want .
mm-mmm . your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a cd .
but what &apos;s the alternative ? microsoft actually did this experiment . they said , &quot; well , wait a minute . everyone complains that we &apos;re adding so many features .
already , we can see that apple and microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design .
i &apos;m like , &quot; you &apos;re a what ? &quot; he goes , &quot; well , jeff hawkins , the ceo , says , &apos; if any task on the palm pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus , it &apos;s too long , and it has to be redesigned . &apos; so i &apos;m the tap counter . &quot;
there &apos;s the old one , responsible for windows and office .
but it turns out i was wrong , right ? because the ipod came out , and it violated every bit of common wisdom .
but the point is : i can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word and having it write out a much longer thing . so if somebody sends me a fan letter , i &apos;ll say , &quot; thanks for that . &quot;
we started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century , and how they &apos;d been improved , and very simple things turned out .
the bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power .
but i wanted to share with you three areas that i &apos;m particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that i was talking about in the wired article .
they conduct heat along their length but not across -- well , there is no width , but not in the other direction if you stack them up ; that &apos;s a property of carbon fiber also .
vaccines that are broad spectrum .
we may not be able to stop it , but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem .
there &apos;s now ample evidence that hardy rodenstock is a con man , and that the jefferson bottles were fakes .
and then i was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that , you know , their purpose had been served , and so i &apos;m afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me .
i don &apos;t play golf , so i couldn &apos;t actually road test these , but i did interview a guy who owns them .
i got to drive this with a chaperone from the company , a professional race car driver , and we drove around the canyons outside of los angeles and down on the pacific coast highway .
there were some people who were a little less impressed .
and so i think that that holds together a great deal of the work that people in this audience approach .
so , with all of these things put together , i think that the chances of life are much greater than i would &apos;ve ever thought .
these organisms we now bring into the lab , and you can see some of them growing on petri plates , and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves .
so , we &apos;re talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave , foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology , various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies .
but when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it , psychologists have found that it &apos;s called a &quot; social reality . &quot;
and i got from global security policy to food because i realized when i &apos;m hungry , i &apos;m really pissed off , and i &apos;m assuming that the rest of the world is too .
understanding how to produce protein in a way that &apos;s healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers .
now if we look at what &apos;s going on in someone &apos;s head when they are being engaged , two quite different processes are occurring .
but we don &apos;t just do that either .
and fifth , the element of uncertainty .
we can reward effort consistently as everything fields together .
blog posts , photographs , thoughts , feelings , opinions , all of these things were being expressed by people online , and leaving behind trails .
&quot; i &apos;ve kissed numerous other boys and it hasn &apos;t felt good , the kisses felt messy and wrong , but kissing lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual . &quot;
that was the first concept here .
this is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping .
but you know , even holding one balloon is like , kind of happy .
a 24-year-old road sweeper . i caught her on her lunch break .
i asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there , you know .
joshua prince-ramus believes that if architects re-engineer their design process , the results can be spectacular . speaking at tedxsmu , dallas , he walks us through his fantastic re-creation of the local wyly theater as a giant &quot; theatrical machine &quot; that reconfigures itself at the touch of a button .
if we are so good at our craft shouldn &apos;t we be able to conceive of an architectural manifestation that slides seamlessly through the project &apos;s and the client &apos;s constraints ?
but imagine the freedoms if you could take this further , that in fact you could consider a wagnerian entry , a first act in thrust , an intermission in greek , a second act in arena , and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits .
you can see the winspear opera house on the right and the dee and charles wyly theater on the left .
the second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who-knows-what in a table in a market .
and here you simply burn it .
i &apos;ll show you in a moment , that &apos;s actually quite useful .
they &apos;re everywhere , six billion a month in india .
but that is , in principle , the way you solve the &quot; fever of unexplained origin &quot; problem , because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease , and this will work in due course .
so , let me finish by saying that we &apos;ve thought about this as a kind of engineering problem .
and the answer , of course , that we keep being given is as follows : we &apos;re told that we went into afghanistan because of 9 / 11 , and that we remain there because the taliban poses an existential threat to global security .
and we had progress in the free media .
beginning in 2004 , every general came in saying , &quot; i &apos;ve inherited a dismal situation , but finally i have the right resources and the correct strategy , which will deliver , &quot; in general barno &apos;s word in 2004 , the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
and there was not a single pashto speaker .
because when people talk about intervention , they imagine that some scientific theory -- the rand corporation goes around counting 43 previous insurgencies producing mathematical formula saying you need one trained counter-insurgent for every 20 members of the population .
if you compare how obama did against how john kerry had done four years earlier -- democrats really like seeing this transition here , where almost every state becomes bluer , becomes more democratic -- even states obama lost , like out west , those states became more blue .
one simple question they asked is , &quot; does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood ? &quot;
a few months ago , a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where i live , and she was brought in confused .
and a woman comes in with a child , and conan doyle describes the following exchange .
and basically everything we know about percussion , which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day -- organ enlargement , fluid around the heart , fluid in the lungs , abdominal changes -- all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript &quot; inventum novum , &quot; &quot; new invention , &quot; which would have disappeared into obscurity , except for the fact that this physician , corvisart , a famous french physician -- famous only because he was physician to this gentleman -- corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work .
i &apos;ve gotten into some trouble in silicon valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who &apos;s in the computer .
they had her scanned inside out .
and when i was done , the patient said to me with some awe , &quot; i have never been examined like this before . &quot;
i remember so many patients , their names still vivid on my tongue , their faces still so clear .
some people call us debunkers , which is kind of a negative term .
or that the &quot; world weekly news &quot; makes stuff up ?
religious iconography .
it was in the top five in 2005 , called , &quot; nine million bicycles in beijing . &quot;
unfortunately i couldn &apos;t go .
and within just a couple years , san francisco became the first no-kill city , running no deficit , completely supported by the community .
and if i can just get enough money to tell enough people , i &apos;ll sell enough . &quot;
that people on the fringes can find each other , connect and go somewhere .
what would happen if , when you &apos;re using your kindle , you could see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment .
you just need a few people -- -- who will look at the rules , realize they make no sense , and realize how much they want to be connected .
my friend red maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes .

throughout its history , islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern .
give me comfort , give me edge .
because sometimes , as proust says , mystery is not about traveling to new places , but it &apos;s about looking with new eyes .
but more importantly , for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark , what sustains desire , i had to go back to the original definition of eroticism , the mystical definition , and i went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma , which is the other side , and i looked at it looking at the community that i had grown up in , which was a community in belgium , all holocaust survivors , and in my community there were two groups : those who didn &apos;t die , and those who came back to life .
it starts very young . it continues into our sex lives child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time .
this is not talking heads , in the picture anyway .

but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there .
but i was on an airplane in the east some years ago , and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte , north carolina .
the introduction of iron , in some ways , had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation .
our problem is that we are separated from our creator , which we call god , and we need to have our souls restored , something only god can do .
and i &apos;ll be asked the same questions that i was asked the last few times i &apos;ve been there .
unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us .
i &apos;ve talked to them .
pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization .
and there were 20 of them that i had -- that i was responsible for , and i worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies .
i will not dance to that beating .
what &apos;s up ted people ? let me hear you make some noise .
all colors run , none of us solid .
faced with absence .
i &apos;d like all of you to pause for a moment , you wretched weaklings , and take stock of your miserable existence .
the third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance .

our 27 percent obesity rate is high , even for this country , and diabetes comes with it .
many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding .
they provide opportunities to be more physically active , as well as local economic development .
in the post-katrina era , we have still more in common .
fellow tedsters bill mcdonough and amory lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that .
help me fight for environmental and economic justice .
things are changing and today , on the united nations statistic division home page , it says , by first of may , full access to the databases .
we &apos;ll swap the axis .
but we have to bring united states forward quite a while to find the same health of the united states as we have in the philippines .
i think it &apos;s the best way of verifying historical statistics .
this we can call dollar street .
get us a mill so that we can mill our flour , then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves . &quot;
economic growth to me , as a public-health professor , is the most important thing for development because it explains 80 percent of survival .
it &apos;s a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious .
it &apos;s done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft .
we don &apos;t really have a problem talking about love .
but right now it &apos;s in dealing with our own people , our own teams who are doing the creating . so , to my story .
we wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for bmw .
and one was hoping that these two teams would get together , and this collusion of incredible creativity , under these incredible surroundings , and these incredibly stressed-out engineers , would create some incredible solutions .
so we went to lunch -- and i &apos;ve got to tell you , this was one seriously quiet lunch .
and i hope that you too find that there &apos;s more to design , and more towards the art of the design , than doing it yourself .
and the very unsatisfying , yet scientific , answer is it &apos;s too hard .
and so we approached this patient and asked if he would collaborate with us .
so what next ?
&lt; transcript &gt;
because if there had been , they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole .
so he says -- i &apos;m not going to do the accent -- he says , &quot; for some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy content , and since then the entropy has increased .
space may be finite or infinite , but because the universe is accelerating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see .
he says , the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can &apos;t live there .
if the universe is not a fluctuation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?
maybe there is something that naturally , through the growth of the laws of physics , gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations .
what i got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars .
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand .
so , pranav , first of all , you &apos;re a genius .

the landscape shows the presence of water directly in view , or evidence of water in a bluish distance , indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally -- get this -- a path or a road , perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline , that extends into the distance , almost inviting you to follow it .
for us moderns , virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies , to express intense emotions with music , painting and dance .
so that overmatched capability creates problems -- catastrophic successes the white house calls them .
we did it so fast we weren &apos;t prepared for their collapse .
but we have trouble accessing our outcomes .
what would an a to z system look like ?

using robotics , laser rangefinders , gps and smart feedback tools , dennis hong is building a car for drivers who are blind . it &apos;s not a &quot; self-driving &quot; car , he &apos;s careful to note , but a car in which a non-sighted driver can determine speed , proximity and route -- and drive independently .
so over here , you can see how the computer understands the environment , and because you cannot see the vibration , we actually put red led &apos;s on the driver so that you can see what &apos;s happening .
mark riccobono : yes .

among layma &apos;s friends was a policewoman who was muslim .
and the women of liberia then mobilized in support of ellen johnson sirleaf , a woman who broke a few taboos herself becoming the first elected woman head of state in africa in years .
we can use our tradition to navigate change .
and if that doesn &apos;t seem fanciful enough , where do you think we &apos;re going to go ?
and if there was a big emphasis at the time to separate men from women , the rituals around the kaaba could have been designed accordingly .
but also the non-muslim communities of north africa -- the animists , even some christians and even a jewish tribe in north africa is known to practice female circumcision .
islam actually , as a monotheistic religion , which defined man as a responsible agent by itself , created the idea of the individual in the middle east and saved it from the communitarianism , the collectivism of the tribe .
similarly , in the arab world , there was what the great arab historian albert hourani defines as the liberal age .
there was one country , though , which was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle .
but this is a promising era in the muslim world .
the moon was closer ; things were different .
fish tried amphibian life . frogs adapted to deserts .

in georgia , after years of stalemate , we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence in august , 2008 .
this certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed .
the core institutions that were put in place in 1998 and their modifications in 2006 and 2008 were highly innovative and allowed all conflict parties to see their core concerns and demands addressed .
so even in situations where outcomes are less than optimal , local leaders and international leaders have a choice , and they can make a difference for the better .

i met sanghamitra eight years ago when i was in bangalore organizing a workshop with leaders of different ngo &apos;s working in some of the hardest aspects of society .
they &apos;ve pioneered a different approach to villages .
so , from commissioning slightly larger than life bronze statues of the heroes of the sino-japanese war , including those chinese who then fought with each other and left mainland china to go to taiwan , to commemorating all the unknown , ordinary soldiers who survived , by asking them to take prints of their hands , he is making sure -- one man is making sure -- that history is not forgotten .
we can &apos;t wait for the next generation , the new joiners , to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need .
it &apos;s emotional . it &apos;s personal .

you will discover that within infinite myths lies the eternal truth .
i mean , no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore .
because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone , for your house .
excuse me one second .
and then in five seconds , they send you back the complete weather forecast for that town .
&quot; which actors have played james bond ? &quot;
and by the way , they don &apos;t always get the words right , because it &apos;s over the phone and all that .
it was when in the fall of 2006 , i explained why apple would never do a cellphone .
these programs can use all the components of the iphone -- the touch screen .
sorry , that was mean .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
the radiologists were , in turn , criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest .
but what else could i offer her ?
shortly after her visit , i was introduced to a nuclear physicist at mayo named michael o &apos;conner , who was a specialist in cardiac imaging , something i had nothing to do with .
but the mbi image shows that tumor much more clearly , as well as a second tumor , which profoundly influence that patient &apos;s surgical options .
but you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo .
it is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations .
marketing people have never been able to do that .
it &apos;s too in silence .
and we build the project to the end .
and i remember an exhibition design i made for john maeda , and for the foundation cartier in paris .
and this is exactly the same at home .
so i designed , for an american scientist based in paris , a very stimulative , brain-stimulative office .
we &apos;ve got to get our hero , captain willard , to the mouth of the nung river so he can go pursue colonel kurtz .
i think about world war ii -- some of our great technologists then , some of our great physicists , studying nuclear fission and fusion -- just nuclear stuff .
terrifying , because we have stronger opinions about our hand-held devices than about the moral framework we should use to guide our decisions .
he says something &apos;s just . she says something else is just .
if you don &apos;t think that way , well , you have a lot of company in the history of western philosophy , because the tidy idea , you know , people criticized it .
and compared to the little pain that it &apos;s going to cause -- because it &apos;s going to be embarrassing when i &apos;m looking on his phone and seeing that he has a farmville problem and that whole bit -- that &apos;s overwhelmed by the value of looking at the phone .
and that &apos;s uncomfortable .
do it over lunch .
we determine how this will all end .
highly addictive -- the high was very short .
now , the group i really want you to think about , though , are the ones at the bottom , the foot soldiers .
it &apos;s exactly this concept .
you can see the skydiver with the red suit , he &apos;s in a stand-up position .
or here -- everybody was freezing , pretty much , except me , because it was very cold in austria where we did this filming .
what is the -- there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit . was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing ?
the other two are dr. tsunemi kubodera and dr. steve o &apos;shea .
but even more incredible was the footage shot from the triton submersible .
&quot; the sleepy giant , &quot; which is the song that i just sang , is one of his poems .
at the time , he was teaching classics at trinity college in dublin .
it &apos;s like , if we don &apos;t act now , it &apos;s too late forever , for 10 years now .
they have graphic designers . what ?
what ?
bjorn lomborg sets global priorities
that was actually the problem that was asked in davos in january .
imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card , but you have no idea what the price is .
they basically came up with a list where they said there were bad projects -- basically , projects where if you invest a dollar , you get less than a dollar back .
and that is really why it becomes a bad project .
one is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
or as schelling put it , imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be -- a rich chinese , a rich bolivian , a rich congolese , in 2100 , thinking back on 2005 , and saying , &quot; how odd that they cared so much about helping me a little bit through climate change , and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather and my great grandfather , whom they could have helped so much more , and who needed the help so much more ? &quot;
and they &apos;re not necessarily , you know , great ways of looking at the entire world .
then this january , my mother died , and pursuing a film like that just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me .
we become what we really are interested in .
working on projects that actually have visible impacts , like a book for a deceased german artist whose widow came to us with the requirement to make her late husband famous .
and along with that , some acetic acid .
i can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation .
this is one of the jackets you grew ?
&lt; / transcript &gt;
the children are virtual prisoners ; they cannot leave , they cannot go home .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting .
again , not buildable in any other way .
can you imagine going online -- this is a reality -- and finding that spare part from a database of geometries of that discontinued product and downloading that information , that data , and having the product made for you at home , ready to use , on your demand ?
here &apos;s the product being built .
and it &apos;s known for prostitution , violence , drugs : a hard place to grow up .
and by many definitions she is no longer poor .
is there something you &apos;ve always meant to do , wanted to do , but just ... haven &apos;t ? matt cutts suggests : try it for 30 days . this short , lighthearted talk offers a neat way to think about setting and achieving goals .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with big , crazy challenges .
first , the coursework at caltech .
first of all , there was a lot of new manufacturing techniques , not to mention really cheap miniature motors -- brushless motors , servo motors , stepper motors , that are used in printers and scanners and things like that .
we looked at a way to break up a parabola into individual petals that would track .
so , because it went into mass production , costs were reduced , 100 years of refinement , emissions were reduced , tremendous production value .
what about if i put a thermal sponge in the middle , in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold ?
the way the unit works is , when the sun comes out the engine will start and you get power out here .
this is the map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a birthright to just use that up as fast as we are , i think .
and the premise of m &amp; amp ; co was , we don &apos;t know anything , but that &apos;s all right , we &apos;re going to do it anyway .
and the books are really journals of my life .
&quot; would , could , should , or would , should , could . &quot;
you don &apos;t even know .
this man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase , and basically -- you know , i guess onions are a theme here .
and then i photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street .
and in each one of these research areas , of which there are even more , there are phd students , like me , and we study incredibly narrow topics , things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules .
we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering .
we can make the circuitry of the right computational power , but we can &apos;t actually put them together to make something that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems .
so , initially nothing happens , they &apos;re just flipping around there .
i was separated , largely , from my family , including my mother and father .
so i think that , in this way , it &apos;s always possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better .
at the end of last christmas only 13 countries had seen h5n1 .
alright , so i &apos;ve got you nervous .
these are in hong kong ; we have nothing like that here .
and then you &apos;re on your own because the pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months .
if you expand that out to think of a whole community , or all your employees in your company , you begin to realize how limited the tamiflu option might be .
it takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory , in highly skilled hands .
a unique ecosystem of plants , birds and monkeys thrives in the treetops of the rainforest . nalini nadkarni explores these canopy worlds -- and shares her findings with the world below , through dance , art and bold partnerships .
they grow in tropical forests like this one and they also grow in temperate rainforests , that we find in washington state .
here in 2009 , you know , it &apos;s not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist , gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer them .
i saw the power of duke &apos;s song with urban youth -- an audience , you know , i as a middle-aged professor , i don &apos;t have a hope of getting to -- in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands .
we gave talks once a month , and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons -- organic gardens , worm culture , recycling , water catchment and beekeeping .
it was taken 18 years ago .
the problem happens when you start to go underwater .
and it was fine and dandy , and it allowed us to go down and find new species .
in our applications , we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply , because it &apos;s a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen .
and those fishes that you see right now are new species .
so sharks aren &apos;t quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be .
well , it turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds , one pebble at a time .
because once you &apos;re dead , you really can &apos;t enjoy anything after that .
and another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant , allowing us to provide a much more accurate of the child &apos;s symptoms .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
what if , out there , others are asking and answering similar questions ?
but those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe .
we are not the determined product of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning .
if you look very hard here you can see the signal from the voyager 1 spacecraft , the most distant human object in the universe , 106 times as far away from us as the sun is .
we &apos;d like to tell our story better , and engage young people , and thereby change their perspective .
they play off each other in a wonderful way .
you know he &apos;d be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him .
he is not a political man , but in this guise he has given us the institution for democracy , from where we can rise .
this past january , i traveled to a place called wais divide , about 600 miles from the south pole .
from this , we can detect an extraordinary number of things .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
thank you frans de waal , wherever you are , i love you and i &apos;d give anything to meet you .
these are pictures the girls themselves never saw , but they gave to us this is the stuff those reviewers don &apos;t know about and aren &apos;t listening to and this is the kind of research i recommend to those who want to do humanistic work .
rockett : hi miko ! what &apos;s going on ?
but we &apos;re really , really happy about who they are .
but he didn &apos;t confess to treason .
and when that was discovered , it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum .
it &apos;s very simple : pour it from an expensive bottle .
people have murdered those that they loved , believing that they were murdering an imposter .
and the answer is a fair amount -- more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn &apos;t adore .
when this came out on television , the value of her art dropped to nothing .
and they gave them a series of painful electric shocks .
here are some of the things they say prevents cancer : crusts , red pepper , licorice and coffee .
and anybody who &apos;s done school biology remembers that chlorophyll and chloroplasts only make oxygen in sunlight , and it &apos;s quite dark in your bowels after you &apos;ve eaten spinach .
now can anybody spot a flaw in this design ?
20 years ago , a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in and the promise was that they would have fewer side effects .
in fact , 76 percent of all of the trials that were done on this drug were withheld from doctors and patients .
we had the first world war , the great depression , the second world war and the rise of the communist nations .
incomes at that time less than $ 1,000 per year .
common , the common -- i think that &apos;s absolutely right , and why ? because there are more drugs to treat common diseases than there are to treat rare diseases .
i &apos;m going to focus on scientists and engineers because i have some data on that , and i &apos;m a data person .
we need a greater demand for ideas -- those larger markets i was talking about earlier -- and a greater supply of ideas for the world .
if you &apos;d been a little more optimistic -- say , based upon the roaring twenties -- you &apos;d have said this .
spread the ideas . spread the light .
and the chinese gave this small ruling elite loads of military weapons and sophisticated technology in order to ensure that people like me would not speak out against this relationship .
you want a better life for yourself .
something else you see that you talk about -- americans don &apos;t talk about this , but you do .
they &apos;re christians .
it &apos;s a holy war against muslims .
i mean , these christians , they &apos;re nuts . how would they do this to their little kids ? &quot;
step outside of your shoes that you &apos;re in right now and step back into your normal shoes .
can you feel that you just want to take these guys and wring their necks ?
and this is what i tell my students : step outside of your tiny , little world .
one day when i was only seven years old and fishing , i pulled a &quot; pinfish , &quot; they &apos;re called , with sharp dorsal spines , up too hard and fast , and i blinded myself in one eye .
to take an example close to home : there are over 500 species of bacteria now known -- friendly bacteria -- living symbiotically in your mouth and throat probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria .
h is for habitat destruction , including climate change forced by greenhouse gases .
it is an encyclopedia that lives on the internet and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world .
i was the cousin oliver of the sitcom of the krosoczka family , the new kid who came out of nowhere .
and to this day , i still can do karaoke to &quot; ice , ice baby &quot; without looking at the screen .
draw the way you &apos;re drawing and keep at it , because you &apos;re really good . &quot;
and for him , it &apos;s only his second .
architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these .
i am forced to ask myself a question .
noise goes up , heart rate goes up .
i love that phrase .
i wanted to have humor , beauty , simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas .
zero is zero , a little hero of the 21st century , and zero can touch so many more people than i possibly could .
he gave entertainment , pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most .
&quot; promise anything to her , &quot; &quot; promise her anything , &quot; and so on .
likewise , we use &quot; force &quot; to indicate not only physical force , as in , &quot; rose forced the door to open , &quot; but also interpersonal force , as in , &quot; rose forced sadie to go , &quot; not necessarily by manhandling her , but by issuing a threat .
nothing ventured , nothing gained .
in low-fat butter , or actually in many low-fat products , when you take the fat out , you actually take the taste and the texture out .
this is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the united states .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and they said scaling , which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes .
and the context is the earth -- the same context that we &apos;re trying to solve our problems in .
really quick syllabus .
on the left , this is a brittle star ; it &apos;s covered with lenses that the people at lucent technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever .
the one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air , does not drink fresh water .
when they &apos;re involved in foreplay , they &apos;re thinking about something very , very important -- and that &apos;s having their genetic material remain , 10,000 generations from now .
and it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs . so it &apos;s not mutually exclusive .
for example , one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine .
or worse , you let it run until it &apos;s warm to rinse out your towel .
and he said that was impossible .
but the researchers had a problem .
in fact , that &apos;s old hat for crows .
and so this goes on for some time .
anna deavere smith : four american characters
well , some of you are laughing . everybody laughs when i say that , but not on this train . silence .
but since this was called &quot; risk taking , &quot; i &apos;m doing somebody who i never do , because she &apos;s so unlikeable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in .
and so he put her in the bathtub , and i was in the bedroom with the baby .
and so i went to both -- two race riots , one of which was the los angeles riot . and this next piece is from that .
he is the only model for black community ; i don &apos;t care jesse jackson .
i mean , you know , i mean , it &apos;s like my wife , jolene , her family &apos;s always saying , you know , you ever think he &apos;s just a born loser ?
but the good thing was , once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out , i could breathe , and i hadn &apos;t been able to breathe since i broke my nose in the high school rodeo . &quot;
i &apos;ll get , &quot; baby , just give me the frickin &apos; tv guide . &quot;
everybody gets heard .
now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways -- you have certain taste , that you like certain things .
it turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution .
&quot; bonk &quot; author mary roach delves into obscure scientific research , some of it centuries old , to make 10 surprising claims about sexual climax , ranging from the bizarre to the hilarious .
but afterwards she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside .
it was called the &quot; upsuck &quot; theory .
so uh , okay .
however , the record holder landed just shy of the eight-foot mark , which is impressive .
i know john &apos;s story very well because i &apos;m john .
now as it turns out -- thank you .
i &apos;m from a completely different cultural area , maybe you noticed ?
i would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced .
everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning .
in the end , one has a list with which one then can arrange .
and it &apos;s not done , as many people imagine , with the computer , otherwise it would look like this .
but before leaving i would like to show you , i &apos;m working right now on another -- in a related field with my tidying up art method . i &apos;m working in a related field .
we &apos;re emulating all the major facial expressions , and then controlling it with the software that we call the character engine .
so we put his writings , letters , his interviews , correspondences , into a huge database of thousands of pages , and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him .
so if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words , you don &apos;t need more than six words for a tedtalk .
and i would only pay $ 99.50 -- so stay even below a hundred dollars for it .
female voice : squashing a snail may not seem important , but remember , even this choice will affect how milo develops .
now is the time when we open that portal and allow you to talk to milo .
this is how war starts .
people don &apos;t want to believe it &apos;s coming , so they don &apos;t leave , they don &apos;t leave before they can .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
but by comparison , we can learn .
we &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft , if language really is the conduit of our cooperation , the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas , in our modern world , we confront a question .
many of you have been there . it &apos;s not the real china .
in the 19th century , it was slavery .
20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol , tobacco , sugary drinks -- and prostitution and festivals .
let me tell you about mahabuba .
pretty soon she had 30 women in the village working for her embroidery business .
you know , the criticism is fair ; it isn &apos;t easy .
join the movement .
no , this is really important to have this sense of scale .
but it clearly cools down .
but when climate became , politically , a hot topic -- if i may make the pun -- in the last 15 years , this became so un-pc , we couldn &apos;t talk about it .
we can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere , in principle solving the ozone problem .
but what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this .
we might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy , that it &apos;s a lot better than not geo-engineering .
and it &apos;s time to begin thinking about it , even if the reason we &apos;re thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn &apos;t do it .
so i create these two poles .
and part of the work that i hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can &apos;t find any discernible formula in how these things -- they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security -- and you can &apos;t completely understand how information is being distributed .
this is at fort campbell in kentucky .
and a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory , if there ever was an actual memory .
i photographed him at the scene of arrest in chicago .
now another way we try to increase our happiness is we medicate ourselves .
i also put in here the stress response .
people have also wanted to deconstruct .
so they assumed this must be , you know , the brain &apos;s orgasmatron .
because when you think about it , people are happiest when in flow , when they &apos;re absorbed in something out in the world , when they &apos;re with other people , when they &apos;re active , engaged in sports , focusing on a loved one , learning , having sex , whatever .
so if you look at questions like this , life satisfaction , you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income .
thank you .
there , the animal finds a mine .
there &apos;s a number of mines placed blindly , and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets .
this is how it works , and really , this is a generic technology .
here is a first prototype of our camera rat , which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on .
so , here is a neuron that fires when i reach and grab something , but it also fires when i watch joe reaching and grabbing something .
and this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense .
that &apos;s about a 50th of a millimeter .
a different pollen signature , if you like , or a different pollen fingerprint .
if we were to remain sexist , and that was not right , but if we were going to go forward and be sexist , it &apos;s actually a woman &apos;s disease .
and right around that time , in the 1980 &apos;s , that we saw women and heart disease deaths going up , up , up , up , up , she wrote an editorial in the new england journal of medicine and said , the yentl syndrome .
you &apos;re going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology .
and again , 50 years of good non-invasive stress testing , we &apos;re pretty good at recognizing male-pattern disease with stress tests .
so we hypothesized that female stem cells might be better at identifying the injury , doing some cellular repair or even producing new organs , which is one of the things that we &apos;re trying to do with stem cell therapy .
women participate .
well , the heart beats , rhythmically , tirelessly , faithfully .
and on this day , at this moment , we walked into the house with our first child , our beautiful baby boy .
so he didn &apos;t just learn water .
and there &apos;s video analytics that are tracking our movements .
three of the key people in this project , philip decamp , rony kubat and brandon roy are pictured here .
and there are fascinating dynamics at play .
this is the first time our son took more than two steps at once -- captured on film .
these sketches brought to life the key ideas , the portraits , the magic moments that we all experienced last year .
so , for example , when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around , to selectively create a visual logic .
and this can be enhanced and augmented with some emerging digital technology .
even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars .
we don &apos;t know of any other house , &quot; and so forth and so on .
so i can show you an object you &apos;ve never seen before .
so the way the apollonian personality takes a picture , or hangs a picture , is they &apos;ll get out a transit and a laser level and a micrometer .
the fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials .
after a year , you can &apos;t get insurance on everything you have in it , only on 70 percent .
and we get sucked into that faster than anything .
human beings are like that .
what don &apos;t you do this , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
but the students are not there . the problem for me was not ignorance ; it was preconceived ideas .
your yellow ones here are the arabic countries , and they get larger families , but they -- no , longer life , but not larger families .
of course it &apos;s a logarithmic scale here , but our concept of economy is growth with percent . we look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase . if i change this , and i take gdp per capita instead of family income , and i turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product , and i take the regions down here , the size of the bubble is still the population .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china , and brought them into the mainstream again .
it &apos;s not the new database you need . we have wonderful design tools , and more and more are added up here . so we started a nonprofit venture which we called -- linking data to design -- we call it gapminder , from the london underground , where they warn you , &quot; mind the gap . &quot; so we thought gapminder was appropriate .
in this software , we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily .
so early on , i heard of charles darwin .
so i wanted to work with him , but he didn &apos;t want a former birdwatcher , and i ended up in cambridge , england .
if dna is that important , linus will know it .
we weren &apos;t the best chemists in the room .
so there &apos;s a picture of francis and i before i met the girl , so i &apos;m still looking happy .
so the dna is really badly mucked up , whereas if you have a chance of surviving , the dna isn &apos;t so mucked up .
and yet , in the controls there were three .
and the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive to cut apart the vehicle to extract the body of the driver .
we create an eye -- and the eye that evolves through all of our history .
if i talk about migraine , 40 percent of the population suffer episodic headaches .
this is a gamma radiation spec scan that uses gamma radiation to map three-dimensional function within the brain .
that &apos;s when i was discharged from the system .
and when i underwent it and found solutions , this is the interrelationship between the tmj and the teeth .
communication , the next c. this is critical .
and i whispered the good news through my broken jaw , which was wired shut , to my night nurse .
that little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on .
you &apos;d think , there &apos;s plenty of paralyzed people in the world , but the audience is too small , and the amount of research , the time it takes , the payback time is too long for v.c. to be interested .
and they started settling out .
now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they &apos;re able to recover in settlements .
&quot; lucky for you he calls at all , &quot; said jasmine .
so the girls thought for a moment , and one girl suggested , &quot; why don &apos;t we just take the dance in the jail ? &quot;
because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought : what type of woman am i preparing to put in the world ?
there was no cure , and there was no vaccine .
now all of these outbreaks that i just showed you , these are under control now , and it looks like they &apos;ll probably stop very , very quickly .
and polio eradication , in many ways , is even tougher , and there &apos;s a few reasons for that .
now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years , much longer than it should have -- but once it was built , the results were striking .
umar was paralyzed for life .
the new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had , and we immediately started using this .
we have a new vaccine , we have new resolve , and we have new tactics .
well , hopefully we &apos;ll get the word out , and the governments will keep their generosity up .
we called her legadema , which means , &quot; light from the sky . &quot;
dj : it was amazing , because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name , he &apos;s focused on this hyena , and he is going to get it .
these are precious to us , these divides .
but i have to tell you -- everybody always asks , &quot; what happened to the baby baboon ? &quot;
bj : and you have to know that , when a male lion is killed , it completely disrupts the whole pride .
&quot; queerer than we can suppose &quot; comes from j.b.s. haldane , the famous biologist , who said , &quot; now , my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose , but queerer than we can suppose .
as an evolutionary biologist , i &apos;d say this : our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at . we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms .
steve grand points out that you and i are , ourselves , more like a wave than a permanent thing .
perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals smell in color . and the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats .
what we say -- and i include the most austerely mechanistic among us , which is probably me -- what we say is , &quot; vile monster , prison is too good for you . &quot;
he actually coined the term cymatics .
and think about the immense sound of the universe forming .
rory stewart : why democracy matters
the point about democracy is not instrumental .
they explained that the galvao bird is a rare and endangered parrot that &apos;s in terrible , terrible danger .
next to japan , it &apos;s the second most represented by population .
we &apos;re heading to the future of bits , where everything is speedy , it &apos;s weightless .
and our media is less global by the day .
and we forget that most of the time we &apos;re checking boston red sox scores .
i &apos;m also guessing that most of you don &apos;t even speak chinese -- which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represented language on the internet .
she has one of the hardest jobs in the world .
dhani jones , who is the middle linebacker for the cincinnati bengals , has a slightly different approach to the off-season .
but it has to be technological , so i &apos;ll talk about electroshock therapy .
well , i have the following from a firsthand observer , who told me this about 35 years ago , when i was thinking about these things for some research project of mine .
i was , in the 1960s , in a marriage . to use the word bad would be perhaps the understatement of the year .
i rarely bathed . i sometimes didn &apos;t shave . it was dreadful .
i really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression , and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it .
and things got better and better , and within three or four months , i was discharged from that hospital , and i joined a group of surgeons where i could work with other people in the community , not in new haven , but fairly close by .
accidents happen . something from childhood comes back to haunt you .
what is this ?
i guarantee you , general tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life -- and indeed , that actually was a picture of general tso .
this is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late 1800s , and if you see , under the word &quot; clears &quot; -- very small -- it says , &quot; they must go , &quot; which refers not only to the rats , but to the chinese in their midst , because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us .
they actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of illinois , right ?
but , you know , it &apos;s very easy to overlook the smaller characters -- oops -- for example , like lem sen , who introduced chop suey , chef peng , who introduced general tso chicken , and all the japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies .
and so in the reverse engineering process that we know about , and that we &apos;re familiar with , for the textile industry , the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things .
or you can do beautiful things that , if the camera can capture , you can make .
which means that all the devices that you &apos;ve seen before and all the formats , in principle , can be implanted and disappear .
in this first-of-its-kind demo , heather knight introduces data , a robotic stand-up comedian that does much more than rattle off one-liners -- it gathers audience feedback and tunes its act as the crowd responds . is this thing on ?
if you like what &apos;s going on , show the green .
the other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911 .
for 30 years of his life , he made false papers -- never for himself , always for other people , and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed .
he was laughing so hard , he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand .
his parents were of russian descent .
now , of course , the man was very impressed with this young man of 17 who could immediately give him the formula , so he recruited him .
of course , there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that i understood much later .
my father made false papers for the american deserters who did not wish to take up arms against the vietnamese .
we live on a human-dominated planet , putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on earth .
the forth pressure is surprise , the notion and the evidence that we need to abandon our old paradigm , that ecosystems behave linearly , predictably , controllably in our -- so to say -- linear systems , and that in fact , surprise is universal , as systems tip over very rapidly , abruptly and often irreversibly .
now , if we have evidence , which we now have , that wetlands , forests , &#91; unclear &#93; monsoon system , the rainforests , behave in this nonlinear way .
in the &apos; 60s already , through the green revolution and the haber-bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere -- you know , human &apos;s today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole .
so crisis leading into opportunities .
now , science indicates that , yes , we can achieve a prosperous future within the safe operating space , if we move simultaneously , collaborating on a global level , from local to global scale , in transformative options , which build resilience on a finite planet .
it was very -- actually , it was a very good study , and got me a job in an ad agency .
actually , the idea came out of an argument that i had at starbucks , that i insisted that i wasn &apos;t having colombian coffee ; the coffee was actually pre-columbian .
and the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings .
&quot; paparazzi . &quot;
i was more interested in the things in between , you know , because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there .
but before doing that , i just briefly want to remind you about what you already know : that our genomes , our genetic material , are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of dna , which is this famous double-helical molecule .
moreover , almost all these genetic variants we see outside africa have closely related dna sequences that you find inside africa .
it means that when we look at people and see a person from africa and a person from europe or asia , we cannot , for a single position in the genome with 100 percent accuracy , predict what the person would carry .
we would expect there to be no difference , because neanderthals were never in africa .
in the west , there were neanderthals ; in the east , there were denisovans -- maybe other forms of humans too that we &apos;ve not yet described .
he checks you out , he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed , your shoulders are crushed down , and , of course , he &apos;s tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well .
the first guy goes , and you &apos;re just in line , and you just kind of lumber to the door .
and i was hooked again on the importance of what i did .
and i saw my battalion commander , because i had let him down .
it was men , women , young , old -- not just from military ; from different organizations , many of them detailed to us just from a handshake .
think about watching your brother , father , daughter , son , wife in a firefight in real time and you can &apos;t do anything about it .
this isn &apos;t easy stuff .
what was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator , as a catalyst , for this dialogue .
in 1975 , muhammad ali gave a lecture at harvard university .
so the last iteration of this project has been called flow , with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world ; really looking , not so much from harlem and out , but looking across , and flow looked at artists all born on the continent of africa .
moreover , i &apos;ve come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success .
and we can see world-changing values in something as humble as a cell phone .
that &apos;s understandable and important .
now , all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis .
&lt; transcript &gt;
he said two interesting things , &quot; a teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be . &quot;
and i set myself and impossible target : can tamil speaking 12-year-old children in a south indian village teach themselves biotechnology in english on their own ?
she said , &quot; what &apos;s that ? &quot;
i have further results , which are almost unbelievable , of scores which go up with time .
the children looked at it and said , &quot; what ? &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
so , blue , blue , everything became blue .
it essentially raises charitable funds from individuals , foundations and corporations , and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans in both for-profit and nonprofit entities that deliver affordable health , housing , energy , clean water to low income people in south asia and africa , so that they can make their own choices .
this is samuel . he &apos;s a farmer .
and so , anuj and acumen have been talking about testing the private sector , because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that , look , in a country like tanzania , 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day .
it shouldn &apos;t be that difficult .
so we were excited by this idea , and we started talking about exactly what it would look like .
it took us 85 takes to get it on film of those 85 takes , only three actually successfully completed their run .
the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that &apos;s a problem .
&lt; transcript &gt;
going forward , imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue .
it gives new meaning to models against animal testing , doesn &apos;t it ?
and then , the size of the earth . somehow making these all compatible with the earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with .
humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous in providing replenishable energy . sailplanes have flown over 1,000 miles , and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet .
all right .
every 25 years i do a picture . here &apos;s the one -- tries to show that the world isn &apos;t getting any bigger .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and the next image i &apos;m going to show is quite gruesome .
that &apos;s why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat .
but how can a cancer spread in a population ?
it &apos;s the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of .
40 percent of all post-conflict situations , historically , have reverted back to conflict within a decade .
it &apos;s not the politics first ; it &apos;s actually the politics last .
the donors provide post-conflict aid .
and so we need a post-conflict compact .
governments in post-conflict situation often respond by puffing up the civil service .
and to date , there has been a sort of a schizophrenia in the donor community , as to how to build basic services in post-conflict sectors .
but , if we put money into the core budget , we know that there aren &apos;t the budget systems with integrity that mean that money will be well spent .
when we talk about power transition , we often talk about the rise of asia .
it &apos;s worth noticing that a non-state actor attacking the united states in 2001 killed more americans than the government of japan did in 1941 .
but in fact , what we &apos;ve seen is none of those were true .
is this just a game that diplomats and academics play ?
there are balancers -- the u.s. , europe , china , japan can balance each other .
and that &apos;s the good news i have . we can do that .
t : i don &apos;t want to let myself down .
is english a tsunami , washing away other languages ? not likely .
her name is pam moran in albemarle county , virginia , the foothills of the blue ridge mountains .
and i guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor , her name was anna aro , said i had the job teaching gifted children .
what i saw was my teachers coming through me .
there are many people on this stage right now .
i throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
i say , &quot; i &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot;
and we were very upset .
i &apos;ll show you what my friend david says about this .
there was no way they could win .
and on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders i &apos;m standing , thank you . thank you . thank you .
i joined telco , made tata trucks , pretty close to pune .
you just need a ton .
and this is a hundred-year-old toy .
this program started with 16 schools and spread to 1,500 government schools .
and this fiber turns a wire attached to an led .

it was a hell of a challenge , and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues .
and one of my favorites is called the cardboard to caviar project by graham wiles .
it may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago .
this photograph was taken on completion day , and just one year later , it looked like that .
when you evaporate seawater , the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate .
stephen wolfram , creator of mathematica , talks about his quest to make all knowledge computational -- able to be searched , processed and manipulated . his new search engine , wolfram alpha , has no lesser goal than to model and explain the physics underlying the universe .
they &apos;re called cellular automata .
its purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine that computes answers to questions .
and , in fact , there &apos;s been an interesting coevolution that &apos;s been going on between wolfram alpha and its human users , and it &apos;s really encouraging .
i mean , anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language .
and each possible rule , in a sense , corresponds to a candidate universe .
my guess is that some great simplifications of what i &apos;m doing may actually have considerable resonance with what &apos;s been done in string theory , but that &apos;s a complicated math thing that i don &apos;t yet know how it &apos;s going to work out .
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , as well as the teachers who taught me , to hiv / aids .
my day started at 5 in the morning , milking the cows , sweeping the house , cooking for my siblings , collecting water , firewood .
i did . the ceremony happened .
i wanted to do something .
and sometimes it comes down to something as simple as , their core wound is their father died without ever saying he &apos;s proud of them .
we talk about world peace .
what is your strategy in your household ?
so we &apos;re starting to pay for things with money that we have .
first things is we see something must be happening when p. diddy vows to tone down his bling .
and , as a result , businesses must provide not only value , but values .
we also see a big diy movement .
and then they did a recent report i thought was fascinating .
and the chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin .
many people visited my grandmother , people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands .
i was constantly telling stories at home , which was good , except i told this to imaginary friends around me , which was not so good .
in my mid-twenties , i moved to istanbul , the city i adore .
but instead of settling down , i went to arizona .
there &apos;s a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the western world are lumped together .
identity politics is made of solid bricks .
we usually distrust those areas that fall in between things .
2004 . brian burton , aka danger mouse , takes the beatles &apos; &quot; white album , &quot; combines it with jay-z &apos;s &quot; the black album &quot; to create &quot; the grey album . &quot;
that is &quot; when the world &apos;s on fire , &quot; a very old melody , in this case performed by the carter family .
now , can someone own this idea ?
thank you . thank you .
but by measuring the way that europa interacts with the magnetic field of jupiter , and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around , we &apos;ve inferred very strongly that there &apos;s an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of europa .
it &apos;s part of that galaxy , and it &apos;s shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it .
to me , it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot;
just look at google maps here . there &apos;s block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
and the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this is also continuing to go grow .
now like most of you , i actually start my day going online and checking email .
privacy is not an option , and it shouldn &apos;t be the price we accept for just getting on the internet .
and the journey , i believe , is a metaphor for all of our journeys .
and so i did .
and in those two years , i graduated with my first degree -- a bachelor &apos;s degree .
i explained , with a friend who could interpret my sign language , that i was john francis , i was walking around the world , i didn &apos;t talk and this was the last time this person &apos;s going to be here interpreting for me .
and on earth day , 1990 -- the 20th anniversary of earth day -- that &apos;s when i began to speak .
and the informal level -- i learned about people , and what we do and how we are .
i had no idea i would have a ph.d .
my subject today is learning .
how can we know this ?
what this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat .
by the beginning of may , the nation &apos;s carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted .
and their higher rates of obesity , diabetes and heart disease are the result .
marco tempest : a magical tale
because the best stories always have a happy ending .
today , thanks to technology , we can share those stories as never before , by email , facebook , blogs , tweets , on ted.com .
&lt; transcript &gt;
unfortunately , the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases , very , very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects , and equally , vast areas of activity , enormous mergers , can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all .
when composers write music for me , i ask them to forget what they know about the cello .
in keeping with the theme of ted2008 , professor stephen hawking asks some big questions about our universe -- how did the universe begin ? how did life begin ? are we alone ? -- and discusses how we might go about answering them .
under extreme conditions , general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space .
if we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy , we should make sure we survive and continue .
jessica jackley : poverty , money -- and love
i heard about disease , i heard about war -- they always seemed to be kind of related .
he also talked about , in particular , microlending , which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business .
and by the way , i was a philosophy and poetry major in school , so i didn &apos;t know the difference between profit and revenue when i went to east africa .
because as that happens , i think we can feel free to interact in a way that &apos;s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
and to close , i just want to say , look these are tools .
another example : have you ever been to venice ?
and the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines gives you already an idea of her significance , i think .
and i said , &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; because there were elephants and lions , and the people were scared and went somewhere else .
so , with all that information , the big question is -- what do we actually -- what does she tell us ?
so the knowledge that we had about our ancestors , on how they looked like , how they behaved , was kind of biased toward adults .
david gallo shows underwater astonishments
he takes a step back -- so he &apos;s keeping off the other males by splitting his body -- and comes up on the other side ...
kristina gjerde studies the law of the high seas -- the 64 percent of our ocean that isn &apos;t protected by any national law at all . gorgeous photos show the hidden worlds that gjerde and other lawyers are working to protect from trawling and trash-dumping , through smart policymaking and a healthy dose of pr .
and these include a sense of shared responsibility , common norms that bind people together as a community .
it &apos;s actually a bay .
these happen to go down to a vast south pacific gyre , where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this , or as bycatch .
we need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect .
carol coletta says , &quot; i would pay someone to do what i do . &quot;
which of course means &quot; criticism , rejection , assholes and pressure . &quot;
ao : yeah .
&lt; transcript &gt;
technology is amazing . people are innovative .
we &apos;ve had economic analysis pointing out that , not only can we afford it , it &apos;s cheaper to act early .
imagine our highly-tuned , just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying .
think about war .
we have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some 10,000 years ago .
he said he heard suspicious laughter .
but a young german doctor picks up archie cochrane &apos;s exercise book and says to his colleagues , &quot; this evidence is incontrovertible .
this is produced by the physicist cesar hidalgo .
you could count them in five minutes .
then the spray dries . it turns into powder .
that is a huge failure rate .
until then , until then i &apos;m going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the god complex .
but cochrane would do that kind of thing .
even as mega-banks topple , juan enriquez says the big reboot is yet to come . but don &apos;t look for it on your ballot -- or in the stock exchange . it &apos;ll come from science labs , and it promises keener bodies and minds . our kids are going to be ... different .
but the problem with santa clause is , if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing and promising folks , it turned out that in 1967 , 38 percent was mandatory spending on what we call &quot; entitlements . &quot;
everything else is mandated .
and what &apos;s really important in this stuff is , as we cut , we also have to grow .
and you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn &apos;t , and where it was in the phase .
but , of course , for most of us , we know how to grow teeth , and therefore we can take adult stem teeth , put them on a biodegradable mold , re-grow a tooth , and simply implant it .
so , rosie runs around on skates and the other one ran on flat threads .
this is a group in germany that &apos;s beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark .
and that , of course , would be the ultimate reboot .
and it &apos;s not based on an a priori notion .
because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate , and as the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems .
and then , again , the building itself , middle of los angeles , right across from city hall .
and it &apos;s the reshaping of the earth to make it occupiable .
and talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together , and then where part of it is in the ground , part of it is oppositional lifts .
my journey to coming here today started in 1974 .
and so i decided to write a book , a memoir , about this decade of my life .
and the most dangerous part of this is that is creates &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them , &quot; &quot; right &quot; and &quot; wrong , &quot; &quot; good &quot; and &quot; evil . &quot;
of course not .
invisible -- everyone of us does it every day , so to speak .
sweet -- energy .
i took the three elements -- stomach , small intestine and colon .
if you have an empty stomach , your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin .
and finally , on your right side , you see a bubbly , cell-like structure appearing , from which the body will absorb the fat .
and these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged .
what is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth ?
you run down to the base of the sacred mountain , antakillqa .
so , 500 years after columbus , these ancient rhythms of landscape are played out in ritual .
there are four societies : the kogi , the wiwa , the kankwano and the arhuacos .
we were able to , because we had trained people in filmmaking , continue with our work , and send our wiwa and arhuaco filmmakers to the final sacred lakes to get the last shots for the film , and we followed the rest of the arhuaco back to the sea , taking the elements from the highlands to the sea .
and there is indeed a fire burning over the earth , taking with it not only plants and animals , but the legacy of humanity &apos;s brilliance .
today , we use a single feedstock , petroleum , to heat our homes , power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you .
this matrix self-assembles , growing through and around the particles , making millions and millions of tiny fibers .
and then one of two things will happen .
that turns out to be important .
that &apos;s one big project .
each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit .
and the second part of the explanation is that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event .
john la grou plugs smart power outlets
okay , two more points . every year in the usa , roughly 2,500 children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles . and this is crazy .
you can &apos;t just tell one side &apos;s story .
how to make it ? it &apos;s simple .
so when these 300 million people , microbloggers , even they block the tweet in our censored platform .
for example , they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard .
the server is in beijing .
sopa , pipa , acta , tpp and itu .
that process is entirely abstract and very , very unusual .
so it &apos;s not too surprising that there were no good treatments for hearing loss .
however , despite this incredible facility that some cochlear implant users display with language , you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can &apos;t hear music almost at all .
but it certainly wasn &apos;t the way the music was intended .
but beethoven composed music long after he lost his hearing .
truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant , because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time .
this is a computer program made of zeros and ones .
you can make a molecule that looks like this , and , you know , he likes to hang out with his buddies , right .
i chose this instrument .
their grim plans were evident .
but not only have i seen with my own eyes during my deployments in lebanon , sarajevo and &#91; unclear &#93; national as the netherlands &apos; chief of defense , this is also supported by cold , hard statistics .
this , ladies and gentlemen , is the rationale behind the existence of my armed forces .
because she wants a better world .
it took us 15 years to sequence hiv -- we sequenced sars in 31 days .
they were shrinking vacuum tubes , making them smaller and smaller .
a key revolution is that we &apos;re understanding our own biology in these information terms .
there &apos;s one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes . it &apos;s blood cell-sized .
we &apos;ll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain , 1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity .

you have to plan ahead to get to the top .
i came up with rule number nine after i actually didn &apos;t plan for a fall , and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib .
we believe all sorts of things .
you &apos;re more cautious . you &apos;re more vigilant .
because there &apos;s nothing in this . well , allegedly there &apos;s nothing .
and if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists , they go away .
maybe a little photoshopped .
here &apos;s some faces on the side of a rock .
i think it &apos;s the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism .
because it worked .
it &apos;s completely blind now , right ?
and reebok set up a foundation after these human rights now tours and there was a decision then -- well , we made a proposal , for a couple of years , about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists .
in my country , it was -- we had been looking at pictures of british soldiers beating up young iraqis ; we &apos;ve got abu ghraib ; we &apos;ve got guantanamo bay .
so i think it &apos;s safe to say i know a little bit about the process of pitching .
next up is knowledge .
you need to be coachable .
the upside means that if you &apos;re telling me that you &apos;re going to be out there , five years out , making a million dollars a year -- hmm . that &apos;s not really upside .
how many bullet points or headlines does steve jobs use ?
this helps to say you &apos;re bigger than just one little thing over here .
because i &apos;m following on .

there we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
the way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .

what are qualities of a bulgarian work ?
rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
it is a huge benefit .
he &apos;s going to think i &apos;m not working hard . &quot;
play increases productivity , not decreases .
first of all , you have to believe me .
what we need is a players &apos; uprising .
&quot; you &apos;ve got to make something good out of something bad , &quot; i started to say to my friends , neighbors , my sister .
i mean , this was 16-millimeter safety film .
i still have -- or did i use the word still ? i didn &apos;t mean that .
my first exhibition in the united states was at the sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 -- that the hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit .
and i got several answers , and i accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically , i thought , halfway to america .

i mean , i had to check the tags and make sure .
i felt incredibly connected to the community around me .
as i was working through that mourning process , i was amazed that i didn &apos;t want to see anybody .
so i &apos;m sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life , this chasm of happiness that we &apos;re driving our proverbial convertible straight into .
so where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this ?
john walker re-creates great performances
in fact , the theme isn &apos;t even the melody , it &apos;s the bass line .
i &apos;m talking about turn it into the data that it was made from , which is how it was performed .
every time i listen to that , i get goose bumps .
we don &apos;t know which experts to believe anymore .
we &apos;re now at another moment when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market .
and , after all this , as the great chinese sage lao tzu said , &quot; governing a great country is like cooking a small fish .
and he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists .
i think what this is all about , this whole movement which is growing from the margins , remains quite small .
the crisis is almost certainly deepening around us .
could there be a connection ?
now it can be dangerous to give too much power to a narrow segment of society .
and millions and millions of students take these tests every year .
and anyway , there was never enough kerosene , because what does a dollar a day buy for you ?
but then , got off on a vacation trip , and was studying bird flight , just for the fun of it , and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles , and measure the time , and estimate the bank angle , and immediately , figure out its speed , and the turning radius , and so on , which i could do in the car , as we &apos;re driving along on a vacation trip -- -- with my three sons , young sons , helping me , but ridiculing the whole thing very much .
humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on , are -- the red line goes up . that &apos;s the humans and livestock and pets portion .

tm : 12 , something like that .
30 years later , mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for 65 percent of bike sales in america .
and just look inside large organizations and you &apos;ll see why that is so .
these people over there will do everything they can to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding , because they &apos;re threatened by them .
let me just give you one final example of what that means .
and one of the reasons they do that is that they turn users into producers , consumers into designers .
and so he said , &quot; i &apos;m sick of all this . nobody &apos;s really living the doctrine .
and he becomes interested in this dog because it &apos;s so pathetic , and it &apos;s trying to attract his attention . and he sits down looking at the dog .
but , being human , he &apos;s immediately thinking of his next complaint .
i got mad . brothers can fight . parents and children can fight .
and so , we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings .
and you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy , even the enemy .
and you then feel you must act .
you can develop this . you can diminish the non-compassion , the cruelty , the callousness , the neglect of others , and take universal responsibility for them .
all of these are possibilities .
or i &apos;m going to use simple to mean reliable , predictable , repeatable .
you carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another , and they support weight .
have you started to do that ?
this is the same person -- top photo , james , bottom photo , &#91; jennifer &#93; .
and i was like , &quot; yeah , ray .
and when i feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry .
and i felt badly for not having done a good job .
they had other sorts of brain damage .
well she said , &quot; there is good news and bad news .
brian cox on cern &apos;s supercollider
and by everything i mean , of course , me and you , the earth , the sun , the 100 billion suns in our galaxy and the 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe .
one of the wonderful things , actually , i find , is that we &apos;ve discovered any of them , when you realize how tiny they are .
h stands for higgs particle .
i &apos;m glad you recognize margaret thatcher .
after about a few minutes , there was hydrogen and helium in the universe . that &apos;s all .
i still paint . i love art .
but to the second question , half of them that didn &apos;t like it , they wanted it to continue .
it &apos;s about system , it &apos;s about organization .
i gave you a very small example of how one thing , the use of color , can make change happen .
smiling is one of the most basic , biologically-uniform expressions of all humans .
smiling can help reduce the level of stress-enhancing hormones like cortisol , adrenaline and dopamine , increase the level of mood-enhancing hormones like endorphin and reduce overall blood pressure .
on street sides all over port-au-prince , entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations .
they are telling their own story , bypassing the official narrative .
stories that offer transformation , that lean into transcendence , but that are never sentimental , that never look away from the darkest things about us .
but her igbo wasn &apos;t too good .
their humanity never seems to matter very much to us .
and father mcgetrick was completely unflustered , just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said , &quot; it &apos;s all right daphne , i &apos;m scottish . &quot;
all it requires is to recognize among us , every day -- the few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people like the ones i &apos;ve told you .
they &apos;re not even autonomous .
so as a result , the angular acceleration , denoted by greek letter alpha here , goes as one over r .
so this robot minimizes snap .
there &apos;s no explicit communication .
so there is no global coordinate system .
so this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees , and that goes deep back for thousands of years .
why are bees doing better in the city ?
you can paint a hive to match your home .
unless you &apos;re on one of these californian low-carb diets , bread is standard .
it brought us power . it brought us mechanization , fertilizers .
but this is now this strange concoction of high calories .
we cannot just think that small-scale is the solution to the world food problem .
what you see is that we &apos;ve started in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture , which was sort of small-scale and low-control .
food is as important as energy , as security , as the environment .
i want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future : to these anonymous farmers , that first bred the first wheat varieties ; and to the farmers of today , who &apos;ve been making this . and you don &apos;t even know who they are .
and what we found was that , instead of getting worse and worse , in many cases it could get better and better , and much more quickly than people had once realized .
i like this slide , because it &apos;s a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change , and what doesn &apos;t .
on a low-fat meal , the blood flow doesn &apos;t go down -- it even goes up .
so , the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages -- these are not health foods -- but to go from &quot; bad carbs &quot; to what are called &quot; good carbs . &quot;
and more seriously , there are case reports now of 16-year-old girls who died after a few weeks on the atkins diet -- of bone disease , kidney disease , and so on .
just take a look at one study . this was done by david spiegel at stanford .
it &apos;s not only because we like to drink lots of it , and its marvelous derivatives , beer , wine , etc .
they are fascinated with snakes . they haven &apos;t got that steely thing that you end up either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way .
and our job is to convince the authorities that these forests have to be protected .
i mean , just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again .
and now &#91; these &#93; new elements of human intolerance for river creatures like the gharial means that if they don &apos;t drown in the net , then they simply cut their beaks off .
ed ulbrich : how benjamin button got his face
this is based on an f. scott fitzgerald short story .
i &apos;ll roll that for you now . this was the first test for benjamin button .
you can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers .
and this really became the template for moving forward .
skin displacement : another big deal .
these guys could go to jail for up to seven years if they were caught by authorities .
&lt; transcript &gt;
so as we talked , richard and i , i said , &quot; you know , maybe i should bring a camel .
in the pen beside him is jasmine .
camelot .
now it &apos;s not a lone nut , it &apos;s not two nuts -- three is a crowd , and a crowd is news .
and i decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire encyclopedia britannica from a to z -- or , more precisely , from &quot; a-ak &quot; to &quot; zywiec . &quot;
i had to put on sunscreen .
and i kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over .
so i basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes -- throw in some sunflower seeds .
given that it was such a vast civilization , you might expect to find really powerful rulers , kings , and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings .
here &apos;s a replica of one such seal .
in the rest of my talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about how i learned to stop worrying and love the challenge posed by the indus script .
there &apos;s a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol .
at the very top you find the uniformly random sequence , which is a random jumble of letters -- and interestingly , we also find the dna sequence from the human genome and instrumental music .
it &apos;s just like our english and dutch example .
and that could be translated into &quot; mey meen , &quot; which is the old dravidian name for the planet saturn .
all the young people , actually , from the city .
and everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception , a little bit , right ?
the dalai lama always likes to say -- he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion , it &apos;s because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence .
the human being is compassion because what is our brain for ?
how many of you here could describe the sound of a single planet or star ?
some of the crackles and pops were lightning , but the eerie whistles and curiously melodious chirps had a rather more exotic origin .
there was a glitch in their soundtrack .
but if you wanted to really do research , what do you have to do ?
it can run the same speed without even that segment .
you can see it here well on this debris .
so why not add a spine ? my colleagues did this at u. penn .
i did .
if we slow it down , they attach their feet at eight milliseconds , and detach them in 16 milliseconds .
here &apos;s the new project : we &apos;re trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot -- no suction or magnets -- that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces .
don &apos;t put it all in the brain , but put some of the control in tuned feet , legs and even body .
and ronald reagan said , &quot; i don &apos;t care what kind of communist he is ! &quot;
making people laugh .
and i &apos;m not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you &apos;re seeing , but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe , who can share their enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place .
as you can see at the top here , they share an up-sweep , like &quot; woop , woop , woop . &quot;
you sound very nearby .
but collision is a serious problem .
there &apos;s a 10 percent differential between getting ba &apos;s and all graduate programs , with guys falling behind girls .
drugs , you want more of the same -- different .
now , multi-touch sensing isn &apos;t completely new .
we have so much technology nowadays that these interfaces should start conforming to us .
in this passionate talk from tedxsanmigueldeallende that &apos;s already caused a sensation in mexico , emiliano salinas , son of former president carlos salinas de gortari , confronts the current climate of violence in mexico -- or rather , how mexican society responds to it . he calls on ordinary citizens to move from denial and fear to peaceful , community-based action . this is the first talk posted on ted.com that was delivered in a language other than english .
corruption ? poverty ? or is it something else ?
it &apos;s like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it &apos;s the flu and it will just go away .
recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public lynchings have been recorded so far in 2010 in mexico .
and for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head .
mahatma gandhi , one of the greatest civil fighters of all time , said , &quot; be the change you wish to see in the world . &quot;
and since richard put me on this whole thing with music -- i &apos;m supposed to actually be doing a project with tod machover with the mit media lab -- it relates a lot to music .
or you can go back and change the height . now , skill .
actually , let me put you in that area of learning , which is very insecure .
trying to figure that stuff out . but is it going to get you anywhere ?
to have a conversation with it . to speak . to listen .
they &apos;re not ideas , they &apos;re instincts .
that was a really good time .
there &apos;s a big display in the mirror , and you can turn around -- but there &apos;s a three second delay .
and my favorite feature , which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment , and then when you come back , it comes up to greet you , happy to see you .
approtec is a company started by dr. martin fisher , who &apos;s a good friend of mine . he &apos;s a ph.d. from stanford .
there &apos;s a world of invisibility there , isn &apos;t there ?
so , one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can &apos;t see we also can &apos;t understand .
we now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000 genes in the human genome .
but at the end of seven years , not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago .
five out of the 100 billion galaxies , with the naked eye , and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you &apos;ve got very good eyesight .
what we learned from 5 million books
since time immemorial , there have been authors .
well the individual n-grams measure cultural trends .
people realized that 1950 was going to happen , and it could be big .
and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person .
everyone can do it because three guys , jon orwant , matt gray and will brockman over at google , saw the prototype of the ngram viewer , and they said , &quot; this is so fun .
in our louder and louder world , says sound expert julian treasure , &quot; we are losing our listening . &quot; in this short , fascinating talk , treasure shares five ways to re-tune your ears for conscious listening -- to other people and the world around you .
and you &apos;re aware of how many people are around you because of the micro-noises you &apos;re receiving .
just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again .
i wrote a whole book about it . so i live to listen .
and before i tell you about that , i just have to tell you this one little picture of graffiti there i picked off the web the other day .
and as a graduate student , you can &apos;t do that . so i said , oh my gosh .
normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists .
but , you know what ? it &apos;s very , very regular .
in the case of the solar system , the idea that the earth is spinning and the surface of the earth is going like a thousand miles an hour , and the earth is going through the solar system about a million miles an hour .
because you &apos;re intelligent and you speak english , you know what word is at the end of this -- sentence .
oh , i &apos;ve been here before . and when you &apos;ve been here before , this happened next . it allows you to predict the future .
you &apos;re constantly making predictions about your environment .
so what will brain theory look like ?
they couldn &apos;t anticipate cell phones and the internet and all this kind of stuff .
it is using that money more rationally to make the countries of the world secure , to make the people of the world secure .
i think what we need is action . &quot;
people could not gather without getting busted and taken to jail .
in my view , what we need today is people getting up and taking action to reclaim the meaning of peace .
look , the homes are full of machines .
even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines .
but the total energy consumption will increase to 22 units .
she managed to study english and learn that as a foreign language .
we sent economists in the soviet union with privatization plans when it broke up , and what they really lacked was social trust .
in one of my books , i joke that ben &amp; amp ; jerry &apos;s should make a pacifist toothpaste -- doesn &apos;t kill germs , just asks them to leave .
and this leads to oddities .
when we watch pornography , it &apos;s a little like having sex , though probably not as good .
a second skill is equal poise , the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own mind .
it seems so elementary .
now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious , of who we are deep inside , and it &apos;s going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture .
i was 15 when i was gang-raped by eight men .
and we are silent about them .
what has been my challenge ?
can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem ?
and i was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more .
but something as basic as happiness , which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue , today it turns out that there &apos;s dozens of ted-like questions that you can ask about it , which are really interesting .
they may well be by a ted speaker , and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual , emotional journey .
so we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible .
and before we have the debate , i &apos;d like to actually take a show of hands -- on balance , right now , are you for or against this ?
that &apos;s where it is on all the time .
solar &apos;s wonderful on rooftops .
his first time at ted , possibly a disadvantage -- we shall see -- from stanford , professor mark jacobson . good luck .
well , right now in the united states , 50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution , and vehicles are about 25,000 of those .
we have facilities around there . you also have a buffer zone that &apos;s 17 square kilometers .
all right .
we need someone for .
i &apos;ve got a hydro conversion at a watermill that i own .
and just now in england they had a cold spell .
ooooh .
we shouldn &apos;t be happy in standing for that .
isn &apos;t that great ?
craig venter has just joined our board and we &apos;re doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him , we &apos;ll be announcing later this fall , about -- imagine being able to sequence anybody &apos;s dna for under 1,000 dollars , revolutionize medicine .
we can begin to sculpt the form .
there &apos;s no randomness involved at all , but it &apos;s not entirely predictable .
this all started when i was age five .
well it looked like a little shanty shed when i &apos;d finished .
and the actual roof is made up of a fiber , which i found in my sister &apos;s old teddy bear .
i used a money spider &apos;s web to actually attach certain things , which sent me insane .
that was the paintbrush .
there &apos;s no way a man can do that .
it &apos;s very painstaking work , but the best things come in small packages .
so i want to ask a question : what should culture in the 21st century look like ?
we have done extensive research to ensure that arab and muslim artists , and arabs who are not muslims -- not all arabs are muslims , by the way -- but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution .
first , it allows us to showcase our arab filmmakers and voices to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world , new york city .
the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism , or &quot; tasawwuf &quot; in arabic .
i &apos;m sure , probably all of you here , or certainly the very vast majority of you , have had what you might call a spiritual experience , a moment in your lives when , for a few seconds , a minute perhaps , the boundaries of your ego dissolved .
the imagery of god is absolute being , absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love .
until , in may 2008 , a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones .
we should focus on the positive .
so a few weeks after my diagnosis , we went up to vermont , and i decided to put jeff as the first person in the council of dads .
then he took my fibula from my calf , cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh , where it now lives .
and one night my daughter eden came to me .
my home is not far from the brooklyn bridge , and during the year and a half i was on crutches , it became a sort of symbol to me .
by laying fallow , i planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones i love .
jane goodall hasn &apos;t found the missing link , but she &apos;s come closer than nearly anyone else . the primatologist says the only real difference between humans and chimps is our sophisticated language . she urges us to start using it to change the world .
so this opens up a whole new avenue of research .
what we find is that over these 40-odd years that i and others have been studying chimpanzees and the other great apes , and , as i say , other mammals with complex brains and social systems , we have found that after all , there isn &apos;t a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom .
and this has led in congo basin , and other parts of the world , to what is known as the bush-meat trade .
we &apos;re harming ourselves around the world , as well as harming the animals , as well as harming nature herself -- mother nature , that brought us into being ; mother nature , where i believe we need to spend time , where there &apos;s trees and flowers and birds for our good psychological development .
one for animals , including domestic animals -- and i have to say , i learned everything i know about animal behavior even before i got to gombe and the chimps from my dog , rusty , who was my childhood companion .
violence leads to violence , at least in my view .
and then as i went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling they couldn &apos;t worry about the environment any more , in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and i was trying to encourage them , somebody came up with a little quotation from mahatma gandhi , &quot; if you look back through human history , you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good . &quot;
we consider first that life has a body .
this is natural from the environment , this clay .
so then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do , and depending on the conditions , we have some protocells on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment .
you turn up the heat , you start making or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar , forming a brownish caramel , right ?
now today , i told you about very strange and weird protocells -- some that contain clay , some that have primordial ooze in them , some that have basically oil instead of water inside of them .
i like this one from the belgian field office , where we met in a roundabout , precisely because the roundabout iconified the headless social movement that informs much social transformation , as opposed to the top-down control of red light traffic intersections .
so it starts by building a better mousetrap , of course .
what we do is we take a fire hydrant , a &quot; no parking &quot; space associated with a fire hydrant , and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt to create an engineered micro landscape , to create an infiltration opportunity .
it &apos;s built as a barn raising , using open source hardware .
they said things like this .
and they text back .
larry burns on the future of cars
we put one every 25 miles on the freeway , and it turns out that translates into about 12,000 stations .
and there &apos;s a simple principle of strategy that says : do unto yourself before others do unto you .
i read that new york city was the first mega-city , a city of 10 million people or more , in 1950 .
so , after some work we were able to georeference it , which allows us to put the modern streets on the city , and the buildings , and the open spaces , so that we can zoom in to where the collect pond is .
so , we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees , the 85 different kinds of fish that were on manhattan , the heath hens , the species that aren &apos;t there anymore , the beavers on all the streams , the black bears , and the native americans , to study how they used and thought about their landscape .
we call these muir webs after the scottish-american naturalist john muir , who said , &quot; when we try to pick out anything by itself , we find that it &apos;s bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken , to everything in the universe . &quot;
in fact , that i see them as reflections of each other , much as lewis carroll did in &quot; through the looking glass . &quot;
again , you know , mental , visual , 10 planets , one planet , 10 planets , one planet . right ?
that land there will remain pasture in perpetuity .
i was giving a talk about two months ago , and this guy , who &apos;d done some work with the u.n. , came up to me and was really flustered , and he said , look , you &apos;ve got that totally wrong ; it &apos;s totally wrong .
you have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out .
these are refrigerators that require no electricity ; they &apos;re pot within a pot design .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
now the reason it won &apos;t work is that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browser or you can make it a clickable link and you &apos;ll still go to google .
so they went for plan b .
you don &apos;t have millions and millions of dollars , but you can call your representatives , and you can remind them that you vote , and you can ask not to be treated like a thief , and you can suggest that you would prefer that the internet not be broken .
in rajasthan , india , an extraordinary school teaches rural women and men -- many of them illiterate -- to become solar engineers , artisans , dentists and doctors in their own villages . it &apos;s called the barefoot college , and its founder , bunker roy , explains how it works .
i said , &quot; no . &quot;
you don &apos;t need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer .
barefoot technology : this was 1986 -- no engineer , no architect thought of it -- but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs .
went to afghanistan .
they &apos;re speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers .
&quot; first they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , and then you win . &quot;
our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code , which are computer programs , that allow these creatures to grow over time .
dan gilbert , author of stumbling on happiness , challenges the idea that we &apos;ll be miserable if we don &apos;t get what we want . our &quot; psychological immune system &quot; lets us feel truly happy even when things don &apos;t go as planned .
interestingly , there are data on these two groups of people , data on how happy they are .
and here are three guys synthesizing happiness .
okay . there &apos;s something important to be learned from these people , and it is the secret of happiness .
we happen to have number three and number four , &quot; we tell the subject . this is a bit of a difficult choice , because neither one is preferred strongly to the other , but naturally , people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four .
&quot; really , jim , you don &apos;t remember ? i was just here with the monet prints ? &quot;
&quot; dogbert &apos;s tech support . how may i abuse you ? &quot;
in one case , the students are told , &quot; but you know , if you want to change your mind , i &apos;ll always have the other one here , and in the next four days , before i actually mail it to headquarters , i &apos;ll be glad to &quot; -- -- yeah , &quot; headquarters &quot; -- &quot; i &apos;ll be glad to swap it out with you . in fact , i &apos;ll come to your dorm room and give -- just give me an email . better yet , i &apos;ll check with you .
they can &apos;t be exactly the same .
and the boys get bigger , and the rockets get bigger .
some people watch this event because of a nascar-like fascination with things bumping and grinding . burning the parachute as it fell -- that was last weekend .
it &apos;s &apos; technology , entertainment and design . &apos; &quot; and she said , &quot; well , you design a story when you make it up , it &apos;s entertainment when you tell it , and you &apos;re going to use a microphone . &quot;
i &apos;m not telling you that story .
&quot; you don &apos;t speak english ? &quot;
&quot; can you even see ? &quot;
&quot; you have a license . how long have you been driving ? &quot;
&quot; no , don &apos;t -- why are we here today ?
how many of you once in your -- you were a kid , you were an adult -- you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone ?
when she writes the expose in about 20 years , don &apos;t believe a word of it .
come on , honey , tell it to me . &quot;
&quot; no . i gave it up with pantyhose -- they &apos;re both too binding . &quot;
robin chase founded zipcar , the world &apos;s biggest car-sharing business . that was one of her smaller ideas . here she travels much farther , contemplating road-pricing schemes that will shake up our driving habits and a mesh network vast as the interstate .
not only do i have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that i can have at my beck and call , but heaven forbid i would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it .
how did you go food shopping ? you went with your neighbor , what a great social time .
we need to put this better market feedback .
so , the beauty of mesh networks : you can have these very low-cost devices .
we have this incredible excess capacity .
we grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn &apos;t take for granted when they grew up -- things like power always on in our houses , things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard .
but it turns out , i jumped on a plane , and i ended up walking a red carpet between sarah silverman and jimmy fallon and martha stewart .
but rosey grier also had in his deeply authentic self , he also loved needlepoint .
we are the only species on the only life-giving rock in the entire universe that we &apos;ve ever seen , capable of experiencing so many of these things .
tourist : it &apos;s reality , it &apos;s us . it happened here .
and in discussing this with other architects , we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them 50 stories taller .
so rick and liz and kevin and i came up with the idea .
and there was therefore this ticking clock , because giuliani was obviously out three months after that .
there was no thought of abandoning ship at that point ?
i think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city , about what &apos;s really happening there .
dr : we &apos;re looking from fulton street , west .
in 2002 , nelson otwoma , a kenyan social scientist , discovered he had hiv and needed access to treatment .
well , things have changed .
there is one key difference with the airplane patent pool .
sunni brown : doodlers , unite !
and here is the real deal . here &apos;s what i believe .
because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form , it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy .
so why would i worry ?
but kids are more vulnerable to brain injury .
it &apos;s at cdc.gov .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so why is that ?
we don &apos;t borrow any energy from history .
and i was taking care of people who were dying and their families in the south side of chicago .
so this is a slide of some of our initial results .
and we found that if your friend becomes obese , it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent in the same given time period .
now , when looked at this , it changed the way i see things , because this thing , this network that &apos;s changing across time , it has a memory , it moves , things flow within it , it has a kind of consistency -- people can die , but it doesn &apos;t die ; it still persists -- and it has a kind of resilience that allows it to persist across time .
and if you look at this image , you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people , again , spreading to three degrees of separation .
that &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
but if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way , you get diamond , which is clear and hard .

ladies and gentlemen : the lxd .
but on pine ridge , i will always be what is called &quot; wasichu , &quot; and &quot; wasichu &quot; is a lakota word that means &quot; non-indian , &quot; but another version of this word means &quot; the one who takes the best meat for himself . &quot;

as a researcher , every once in a while you encounter something a little disconcerting .
well the easy answer is , we just haven &apos;t gotten those salts to those people .
we think there &apos;s an income problem , so we create new ways of farming that increase income .
because if some of your troops get diarrhea they &apos;re not that effective on the battlefield .
this is easy , $ 1.10 .
same thing here : you had an intuitive response to this that was very quick .
okay , back to bmw . what should they do ?
you just gotta carry this thing around .
how much are we putting into energy behavior change in a credible , systematic , testing way ?
rockstar designer stefan sagmeister delivers a short , witty talk on life lessons , expressed through surprising modes of design .
after a week , we took the stencils and the leaves off , shipped the newsprints to lisbon to a very sunny spot , so on day one the billboard said , &quot; complaining is silly . either act or forget . &quot;
and so i want to do a little demo for you .
have fun . thank you .
one item here was water , right ?
so , please mix them .
not at the last card .
please name any card , anyone .
good .
now some hard stuff .
it doesn &apos;t matter to me .
no ? now ?
just kidding , warming up -- king of hearts .

these are the people who never listen to classical music .
&quot; i don &apos;t think we should go to the same place for our summer holidays next year . &quot;
no , otherwise the play would be over , stupid .
like the bird who flies over the field and doesn &apos;t care about the fences underneath , all right ?
i say , &quot; how would you walk ? how would you talk ? how would you be ?
and she told me this , she said , &quot; we were in the train going to auschwitz , and i looked down and saw my brother &apos;s shoes were missing .
and here is a similar sculpture .
this has a diamond-bottomed lake .
it would also be able to be an open code , so people could interact with it .
somebody , some people -- and i saw somebody kind of make the motion over here -- some people have a great idea where they light the match , melt the side of the candle , try to adhere it to the wall .
and what &apos;s interesting about this experiment is that it &apos;s not an aberration .
that reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility .
they gave these mit students a bunch of games , games that involved creativity , and motor skills , and concentration .
and if we really want to get out of this economic mess , and if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century , the solution is not to do more of the wrong things , to entice people with a sweeter carrot , or threaten them with a sharper stick .
atlassian is an australian software company .
now some of you might look at this and say , &quot; hmm , that sounds nice , but it &apos;s utopian . &quot;
the drive to do things cause they matter .
and then speak a little bit about how it comes about .
and then you have other stories , unseen .
and then -- sort of -- so not only the instruction is clear , but also the sanction , what will happen if you don &apos;t do what i tell you .
do not interfere .
&quot; do you understand what this guy wants ? &quot;
but how does it really work together if it doesn &apos;t give them instructions ?
i have a short notice to give you . &quot;
kleiber is about conditions in the world .
&lt; transcript &gt;
but are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ?
but the world isn &apos;t second life .
resilience runs much deeper : it &apos;s about building modularity into what we do , building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us .
most of our local authorities , when they sit down to plan for the next five , 10 , 15 , 20 years of a community , still start by assuming that there will be more energy , more cars , more housing , more jobs , more growth , and so on .
this is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning .
now how did we get here ?
they make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out .
there &apos;s the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness , measuring them , giving them feedback , taking videos in the classroom .
we need to take the fact that the current employees , the future liabilities they create , that should come out of the current budget .
and in this session , gabby &apos;s working with a speech therapist , and she &apos;s struggling to produce some of the most basic words , and you can see her growing more and more devastated , until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears , and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist .
young-ha kim : be an artist , right now !
and you continue to make connections .
playing doesn &apos;t tire us .
of course , my work was very amateur , but let &apos;s turn to more famous examples .
we get jealous , not because we &apos;re evil , but because we have little artists pent up inside us .
the magic question is , &quot; what for ? &quot;
let &apos;s start with how i got to this point .
evidence of global warming was much stronger .
this imbalance , if we want to stabilize climate , means that we must reduce co2 from 391 ppm , parts per million , back to 350 ppm .
and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago .
it would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control .
i need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively .
my favorite and a real hero of mine is yakima canutt .
car stunts are another area where technology and engineering advances have made life easier for us , and safer .
only one person had ever done it before .
we fly people on wires , like this .
bear in mind , ladies and gents , this was 1960 .
i &apos;m excited and i &apos;m scared , both at the same time in equal measures .
he left the company because he saw , as some other people in the space suit industry , an emerging market for space suits for space tourists .
i think it &apos;s a great challenge .
and the third part of this is that we &apos;ve all agreed , nonetheless , on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation . i mean , sirena last night was a marvel , wasn &apos;t she ? just seeing what she could do .
anyway , the three boys came in -- four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads -- and they put these boxes down , and the first boy said , &quot; i bring you gold . &quot;
my son didn &apos;t want to come .
they &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life . but they &apos;re rather curious , and i say this out of affection for them .
if you didn &apos;t have a job it &apos;s because you didn &apos;t want one .
anyway , gillian and i had lunch one day and i said , &quot; gillian , how &apos;d you get to be a dancer ? &quot; and she said it was interesting ; when she was at school , she was really hopeless . and the school , in the &apos; 30s , wrote to her parents and said , &quot; we think gillian has a learning disorder . &quot; she couldn &apos;t concentrate ; she was fidgeting . i think now they &apos;d say she had adhd . wouldn &apos;t you ? but this was the 1930s , and adhd hadn &apos;t been invented at this point .
we need to take our responsibilities seriously , but not ourselves .
here &apos;s how the dots connected .
and notice two of them are wearing headscarves , and yes , even they can laugh .
for inspiration , go to one of our festivals , go online , drop us a line .
but we dug our heels and said , &quot; we &apos;re not in the number game .
but isn &apos;t it strange that little boys all over the world love fast bikes ?
everybody was very friendly , especially i got a lot of friends .
it is not the infrastructure , not the toilets , not the libraries , but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important .
thank you .
let &apos;s see if they congregate around certain ideas .
this is the way it ought to be .
as a kid , i watched a lot of television and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics .
another one which believes in the pure transparency of content .
what &apos;s happening is , the art form is colliding with the given technology , whether it &apos;s paint on stone , like the tomb of the scribe in ancient egypt , or a bas-relief sculpture rising up a stone column , or a 200-foot-long embroidery , or painted deerskin and tree bark running across 88 accordion-folded pages .
and notice what &apos;s going on here .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so no ego problems .
this is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic , all of the flight-or-fight responses , operate .
i was visiting with joel the weekend before the copenhagen conference on climate change opened in december of 2009 .
well , i &apos;m involved in other things , besides physics .
it was written by russell baker , who used to write an &quot; observer &quot; column in the new york times .
but mostly , it &apos;s achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that don &apos;t really make any sense .
and there weren &apos;t a lot of books about the history of design in the early 70s . there weren &apos;t -- there wasn &apos;t a plethora of design publishing .
and in that moment of desire and focus , he can win .
so , i changed it so that every season was different , and i continued to do these posters , but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual , and they didn &apos;t have that heft of everything being the same thing .
this is the building that -- they had no money , and they had to recast it , and they said , if we give you 100,000 dollars , what can you do with it ?
that was the play part of the job .
and that &apos;s a terrifying factor -- when you start something and it turns that way -- because it means that all that &apos;s left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push , that you can invent , that you can be ignorant about , that you can be arrogant about , that you can fail with , and that you can be a fool with .
you know , you look at sharks , and they &apos;re streamlined , and they &apos;re sleek , and you look at tuna , and they &apos;re like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda . they &apos;re about migration and strength , and then you look at the sunfish .
and in the mediterranean , in the swordfish net fisheries , they make up up to 90 percent .
not so many california sea lions down there .
they &apos;re super industrious .
today we don &apos;t need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display .
it &apos;ll be on display at the interactive telecommunications spring show in greenwich village in new york city -- that &apos;s open to the public , definitely invite you all to come and attend -- it &apos;s a fantastic show .
at tedindia , mallika sarabhai , a dancer / actor / politician , tells a transformative story in dance -- and argues that the arts may be the most powerful way to effect change , whether political , social or personal .
very confused at what we humans call justice .
and all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies , and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don &apos;t require , they also know the power of the arts .
and it was a simple idea . it was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field .
five , six , seven , eight folds we make .
want to kill that cyclist on the way to work , and string up your cousin &apos; cause she &apos;s such a jerk . oh , dear .
because , any future planning , if 2048 is when we want to get there , unless the arts are put with the scientists , with the economists , with all those who prepare for the future , badly , we &apos;re not going to get there .
&quot; now what shall we do ? &quot; said the king .
i &apos;m starting the story with the first atomic bomb at trinity , which was the manhattan project . it was a little bit like ted : it brought a whole lot of very smart people together .
such a computer would open up universes , which are , at the present , outside the range of any instruments .
they actually used 6j6 , the common radio tube , because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes .
so , already , they &apos;re complaining about the manuals : &quot; before closing down in disgust ... &quot; &quot; the general arithmetic : operating logs . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember a mac that was 16 megahertz , that &apos;s slow speed .
other people couldn &apos;t get the machine running . it always worked for him .
and it was his universe on punch cards .
and it &apos;s julian bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off .
anyway , this mysterious group anonymous -- and they would say this themselves -- they are providing a service by demonstrating how useless companies are at protecting our data .
and so nothing is going into the hackers .
and after that , it just went wild .
at 13 , with only little english and being bullied at school , he escaped into a world of computers where he showed great technical ability , but he was soon being seduced by people on the internet .
they are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid-teens .
sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in huntington , w. va . , ted prize winner jamie oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food .
fact : diet-related disease is the biggest killer in the united states , right now , here today .
she &apos;s got six years to live because of the food that she &apos;s eaten .
this is our landscape of food .
stacy : just feeling really sad and depressed right now .
pizza for breakfast . they don &apos;t even get given crockery .
i want to tell you about something , i want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we &apos;re in , guys . ok ?
here is the thing , right , it cannot just come from one source .
the staff are the moms and dads of america &apos;s children .
i &apos;m here .
in great neck , new york , they call it a &quot; pussy-cat . &quot;
and i was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular panel that it &apos;s beneath , beyond , and between , and the vagina kind of fits into all those categories .
they &apos;re like the mercedes-benz of the rift valley .
i went back to south carolina after some 15 years amid the alien corn at the tail end of the 1960s , with the reckless condescension of that era thinking i would save my people .
and in a twist you would not believe in a steven spielberg film -- the gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief who had stolen socks from mr. teszler &apos;s hosiery mill .
he gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility and he asked if there were any questions .
whenever you hear this , i will be there . &quot;
they got along famously until the very end of the meal , and then they got into a furious argument .
and in the process , what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges .
june williamson and i have been researching this topic for over a decade , and we &apos;ve found over 80 varied projects .
it &apos;s not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was , but it &apos;s serving its community .
this is another infill project on the parking lots , this one of an office park outside of washington d.c .
it &apos;s providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle .
and the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit .
they have urban streetscapes , but suburban parking ratios .
there is no government to protect them .
so we came up with these two rules .
so that &apos;s how i decided &#91; to do &#93; the same .
she shows us , trains us how to do and how to be better &#91; people &#93; and how to do long hours in surgery -- 300 patients per day , 10 , 20 surgeries , and still you have to manage the camp -- that &apos;s how she trains us .
in today &apos;s context , it was a bunch of crap , but it was the law of geology , vertical tectonics .
and like a living organism , you tear it open , it bleeds its molten blood , rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere , hardens , forms new tissue and moves laterally .
no mouth , no gut , no digestive system .
it contains more history than all of the museums on land combined .
she &apos;s talking to the pilot . she &apos;s 5,000 miles away , but she &apos;s assumed command .
finally , even for those who do manage to get the higher education , the doors of opportunity might not open .
it started on a given day , and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments .
the answers happen to be pairs of numbers , so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot .
philosopher-comedian emily levine talks about science , math , society and the way everything connects . she &apos;s a brilliant trickster , poking holes in our fixed ideas and bringing hidden truths to light . settle in and let her ping your brain .
you know , because -- and by the way to i was so grateful to dean kamen for pointing out that one of the reasons , that there are cultural reasons that women and minorities don &apos;t enter the fields of science and technology -- because for instance , the reason i don &apos;t do math is , i was taught to do math and read at the same time .
when they lay together in bed it was , as it had to be , as the nature of the act demanded , an act of violence .
i think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots , which is why you don &apos;t see me making fun of kenneth lay and his charming wife .
but i like to cross boundaries .
i just wanted to put the scientists in their place .
one is , another characteristic of trickster is that the trickster has to walk this fine line .
therefore every moment really is the most important moment that &apos;s ever happened , including this moment right now .
he wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year , a two-trillion-dollar federal budget , which will land us back into deficit spending real fast .
ten years ago , you couldn &apos;t have found an astronomer -- well , very few astronomers -- in the world who would &apos;ve told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system .
it wasn &apos;t really a research report ; it was a screed .
let it recover , before we start logging again .
but the thing that &apos;s alarming is a couple of months ago , in mexico , where bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal , they found bt corn genes in wild corn plants .
we need to learn how to repair and replenish the earth &apos;s ozone layer .
the bubonic plague in europe , in the middle ages , killed one out of four europeans .
but galaxies are very violent places , and things can be spun out of orbit .
there are about 100,000 balls of ice and rock -- comets , really -- out there , that are 50 miles in diameter or more , and they regularly take a little spin , in towards the sun and pass reasonably close to us .
we sent a probe out to this asteroid belt , called near , near earth asteroid rendezvous .
we &apos;re in 17th century japan on the west coast , and a little , wizened monk is hurrying along , near midnight , to the crest of a small hill .
that &apos;s the system .
and there &apos;s an urgency to this .
some of you remember this , i &apos;m sure .
you can transmit power , but the bandwidth is in those tiny , little threads smaller than the hair on your head in diameter .
there will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore , all available to anyone who has any interest in using it .
and that &apos;s transmitted back to land immediately .
many of you don &apos;t think of this yet , but the ocean will be in your pocket .
he said , &quot; john , i want you to become a good herder .
and they sent me off to school , just to get busy somewhere there .
they were not people from outside .
today , we have got 60 conservancies that manage and protect over 13 million hectares of land in namibia .
but ice has another meaning .
and these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers , and they look in on the glacier from permanent , bedrock positions , and they watch the evolution of the landscape .
goes up to 280 and then drops for various reasons that aren &apos;t important to discuss right here .
we &apos;re going to be up there in just a few more weeks , and we expect that it &apos;s probably retreated another half a mile , but if i got there and discovered that it had collapsed and it was five miles further back , i wouldn &apos;t be the least bit surprised .
so that &apos;s where we started three years ago , way out on the left , and that &apos;s where we were a few months ago , the last time we went into columbia .
the interior of greenland is to the right .
fortunately , a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now .
restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
and we are hiding that cost behind monster profits .
dan barber and alice waters are leading passionately the green food delicious revolution .
one of the other things we did was begin to diversify the species that we served -- small silverfish , anchovies , mackerel , sardines were uncommon .
i get the meat sweats .
poet rives does 8 minutes of lyrical origami , folding history into a series of coincidences surrounding that most surreal of hours , 4 o &apos;clock in the morning .
he did it with this famous piece from the new york museum of modern art .
it is christmas day , 4 a.m .
but if he were here -- he might remind us , as he does in the wrap-up to his fine autobiography , that on this day bill clinton began a journey -- a journey that saw him go on to become the first democrat president elected to two consecutive terms in decades .
they float freely in three dimensions without any forces acting on them .
what we see are , first of all , a very active culture , a lot of divisions , and then very clear nuclei once the cells have separated .
and then the second group received only tumor treating field therapy .
there &apos;s none of the tiredness .
she is managing her farm .
and in most parts it is saline , not fit for drinking .
we often use a term called bylaws .
and this is what they call zero b type of water , because it comes from the clouds , pure distilled water .
you won &apos;t find water in this slide .
dry water body . children are standing on a very difficult device to explain .
this was done in 11th century .
so , first of all , i wish i had your eloquence , truly , in any language .
and i think by 2009 , this news has finally reached britain , so i should probably add gordon brown to this list as well .
in fact , qq.com , which is a popular chinese website , had 35,000 comments on this issue within hours .
and it &apos;s great simply because they can gather open source intelligence .
tony porter : a call to men
sit down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a -- &quot; what ?
i grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city .
we don &apos;t talk about that as men .
so now there &apos;s a living room full of guys .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and of course they have more influence , sometimes , about how they &apos;re seen .
and he whipped out his cellphone , dialed the number , and a voice said , &quot; i &apos;m up here . &quot;
crime went up at 8 : 30 . i have read a reuters dispatch -- so this is not indian propaganda , a british news agency -- about how robbers in the town of musarri sharif * stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers , its hubcaps , its sideview mirrors , any moving part they could find , at 8 : 30 , because the watchmen were busy watching the t.v. rather than minding the store .
all the others have been all those three .
that &apos;s why india belongs at ted , and that &apos;s why ted belongs in india .
having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question i have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of limpopo , with an allowance of 50 rand a week , i came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
well , i wasn &apos;t so interested in the swimming .
and that is that , when we lower the oxygen concentration further by 100 times , to 10 parts per million , they were not dead , they were in suspended animation , and we could bring them back to life without any harm .
it was a television show -- it was a nova show on pbs -- about caves in new mexico .
i told you hydrogen sulfide is in us .
in fact , so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit i just mentioned , which is a wonderful thing , if you &apos;re thinking about adopting this .
&quot; in the theory with which we have to deal , absolute ignorance is the artificer ; so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system , that , in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine , it is not requisite to know how to make it .
and it &apos;s a good thing that there isn &apos;t , because if there were , then mother nature would have a problem : how on earth do you get chimps to mate ?
well now , finally what about funny . my answer is , it &apos;s the same story , the same story .
ok ? stop . all right , now .
and it &apos;s actually something that we invented a few years ago , or created a few years ago .
and this openness is the beginning of exploratory play .
and then he did what &apos;s called the purdue creativity test .
so , they &apos;re great examples , i think , of exploration and experimentation in design .
and then the sad thing is , although preschools are full of this kind of stuff , as kids go through the school system it all gets taken away .
so role-play is actually , i think , quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences .
but everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks .
one of the big reasons is , we think success is a one-way street .
i was faster but just as depressed .
it doesn &apos;t look like this ; it really looks more like this .
i decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life .
here &apos;s our winner of the soprano solo .
and some younger members .
so two things struck me deeply about this .
and so today i &apos;ll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike , work that i &apos;ve done in collaboration with wyatt korff and roy caldwell .
and for those of you who prefer miles per hour , that &apos;s over 45 miles per hour in water . and this is really darn fast .
and one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it &apos;s -- he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that &apos;s made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points .
here &apos;s that same orientation that we saw earlier .
so , the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring -- has actually been well known to biologists for a long time , not as a spring but as a visual signal .
and the next lines are , &quot; through the unknown remembered gate , where the last of earth discovered is that which is the beginning . &quot;
it actually is a very good working sub -- that &apos;s what it was designed for .
i wanted you to notice that she actually turned to come back up .
we &apos;ve been just feet apart . i &apos;m going back down now . &quot;
reviving new york &apos;s rivers -- with oysters !
and here &apos;s a map of that condition , showing the contaminants in yellow and green , exacerbated by this new flow of storm-surge and sea-level rise .
you can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space .
and it was in many ways , at this point in the mid-1850s , a complete disaster .
he suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and i was watching this crowd of monks and nuns , many of which i had just interviewed , and heard their stories , and i watched their faces , and they gave us a little fm radio , and we could listen to the translation of his teachings .
you know , violence as a political tool is all the rage right now .
and we watched and stayed with john doolikahn .
it was a two million dollar study .
and then i &apos;m going to show you it &apos;s actually a lot more complicated .
and that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe .
it &apos;s not just throwing them out at random .
these little specks that you &apos;re seeing in here , they &apos;re galaxies .
so there it is .
just a moment ago , my daughter rebecca texted me for good luck .
they text and shop and go on facebook during classes , during presentations , actually during all meetings .
when i ask people &quot; what &apos;s wrong with having a conversation ? &quot;
and one day i came in and a woman who had lost a child was talking to a robot in the shape of a baby seal .
just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m calling for here , now : reflection and , more than that , a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us , what it might be costing us .
they need us .
the master said , &apos; thou didst thy best , that is success . &apos; &quot; from those things , and one other perhaps , i coined my own definition of success , which is : peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you &apos;re capable .
they ask me why i teach and i reply , &apos; where could i find such splendid company ? &apos; &quot; and i believe the teaching profession -- it &apos;s true , you have so many youngsters .
those were three things that i stuck with pretty closely all the time .
you and i know deeper down , there &apos;s always a chance to win the crown .
sometimes i &apos;m asked who was the best player i had , or the best teams .
somebody else is in there ahead of them .
but i want you to note his co-author : charles lindbergh .
and you see that patient now six months after with an x-ray showing you the regenerated tissue , which is fully regenerated when you analyze it under the microscope .
we use now some type of technologies , where for solid organs , for example , like the liver , what we do is we take discard livers .
we &apos;re also working on more sophisticated printers .
i couldn &apos;t go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like i was going to pass out when i got back inside .
all i wanted to do was to get better , and i didn &apos;t realize how amazing it really was until now that i &apos;m older and i see the amazing things that he &apos;s doing .
now the easiest analogy for swap-trading is like an online dating service for all your unwanted media .
what &apos;s happening is the internet is removing the middleman , so that anyone from a t-shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer-to-peer .
from morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food , we are consuming and collaborating once again .
the average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run .
now in the old consumer system , our reputation didn &apos;t matter so much , because our credit history was far more important that any kind of peer-to-peer review .
i &apos;m a phd student at mit , and i happen to study atmospheric science .
mo : my church group of 50 would like housing and meals for a week while we repair properties .
you build both gradually until a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election .
and we launched our platform .
let me show you some images of what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow .
&quot; armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation : they paid 1,500 shillings in rent , about 20 bucks a month , a relatively high price for a kenyan shantytown , and they could not afford to be late with the money .
we &apos;re seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs , and plaster over the brick , some color , and this is sulay montakaya &apos;s house in sultanbelyi , and it &apos;s getting even better .
this is a shopping street in kibera , and you can see that there &apos;s a soda dealer , a health clinic , two beauty salons , a bar , two grocery stores , and a church , and more .
that &apos;s sureka gundi ; she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median .
every time school closed -- it was a boarding school and i was seven -- you had to travel until you find them .
and that man told me , &quot; so , here you are .
this is the world we live in .
you should also keep your blood pressure down , because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for alzheimer &apos;s disease .
acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by definition .
and the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question the cold , unfeeling god .
do we have a local god who can do little things like parking spaces , but not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves ?
i merely , most respectfully , return him the ticket . &quot;
in the tsunami , in the victims . in the depth of things .
it needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting , a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness to those whose experience is different from my own .
i &apos;m trying . that clock has got me .
so that was the basis of it , was one-on-one attention .
the teacher tells them what to do , how to do it , what their training is , what their project is so far .
they didn &apos;t want to sell pirate supplies .
he &apos;s now been published in five books .
what is the significance ?
there are very few young infants because they die -- high mortality rate -- and there &apos;s very few old people .
and even at that time , with the introduction of agriculture , 8,000 , 10,000 years ago we started to see climate change .
it &apos;s the increased order .
a bacterium , which has no consciousness at all , wants to move towards light .
when we have a bad idea , the response to a bad idea is not no ideas , it &apos;s not to stop thinking .
i really appreciate your attention today . thank you .
i grew up with the sounds of war -- the staccato sounds of gunfire , the wrenching booms of explosions , ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens .
how interesting .
in order for us to understand what actually peace means , we need to understand , as one sudanese woman once told me , &quot; peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again . &quot;
we need to invest in women , because that &apos;s our only chance to ensure that there is no more war in the future .
but i really like that , so i wrote a book called &quot; the laws of simplicity . &quot;
we love relationships -- very complex . so we love this kind of stuff .
and she was a tedster , exactly , and she showed us , she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again .
so , somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined , i think .
so , i say , &quot; no , i make eye meat , &quot; instead .
and with these cheetos , i began to think , &quot; what can i make with these cheetos ? &quot;
because i want to simplify them for you .
as you age from infant age , your vision gets better , and maybe in your late teens , early twenties , you &apos;re looking for a mate , and your vision goes after that .
i have been trying to tell this story for a long time .
they have exactly the same amount of carbon .
but we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis . this is in bolivia -- over thirty years .
we can &apos;t wait for the kind of drought australia had to change our political culture .
the richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed .
a new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge .
it &apos;s a brand-new love affair that we &apos;re trying to cultivate at moma . together with adam bly , who is the founder of seed magazine -- that &apos;s now a multimedia company , you might know it -- we founded about a year ago a monthly salon for designers and scientists , and it &apos;s quite beautiful .
instead , this element here is much more banal .
this is a spa telephone . the idea is that it &apos;s become so difficult to have a private conversation anywhere that you go to the spa , you have a massage , you have a facial , maybe a rub , and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature , and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you &apos;ve been wanting to talk with for a long time .
also , the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more .
because it &apos;s not anymore mom , dad , the flowers and the bees , and then there &apos;s the baby . no , it can be two moms , three dads , in-vitro -- there &apos;s the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed .
the first step we did was to collect . we did 130 different sources of information -- from ngo reports to newspapers and cable news .
that was a challenge we had to face as physicists .
this is when the surge happens .
and all the main religions have similar teachings .
it means it gets filled with hot air .
next week , with raisins . &quot;
and it &apos;s from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning , that pain is a disease .
how can the nervous system get this so wrong ?
it &apos;s successful , as you can see from this video of chandler , who , two months after we first met her , is now doings a back flip .
because as we heard yesterday , countries can lose stars from their flags , but they can also lose press freedom , as i guess americans among us can tell us more about .
because i thought , i still maintain , that serious and independent media companies are great business .
at the end of the meeting he says , look , it is not going to work ; you will never see your money back ; but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea .
they want to -- the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press .
and i can , but i &apos;ll give you just , maybe one , and depending on time i may give you two examples who we work with .
somewhere down the road we opened a media management center .
i don &apos;t want to advertise them too much ; that &apos;s not the point .
what &apos;s six miles wide and can end civilization in an instant ? an asteroid -- and there are lots of them out there . with humor and great visuals , phil plait enthralls the tedxboulder audience with all the ways asteroids can kill , and what we must do to avoid them .
because back then , video cameras were just starting to become popular , and people would bring them , parents would bring them , to their kids &apos; football games to film their kids play football . and since this came in on a friday , they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virgina , maryland , pennsylvania and new jersey until it did that to a car in new york .
if one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere , it would cause a panic .
i don &apos;t think apophis is a problem .
the problem is , what happens if you hit this asteroid , you &apos;ve changed the orbit , you measure the orbit and then you find out , oh , yeah , we just pushed it into a keyhole , and now it &apos;s going to hit us in three years .
they &apos;re a hundred years ahead of us with this drive . &quot;
well , here &apos;s an example from my own experience .
we express these things mathematically .
that is absolutely remarkable , and that is a central feature of what i &apos;m trying to say today .
you see above , at the top , a long list of equations with three components for the three directions of space : x , y and z .
proximate self-similarity . and that accounts for this phenomenon .
life can emerge from physics and chemistry , plus a lot of accidents .
even as a child , it seemed , lincoln dreamed heroic dreams .
he eventually won a seat in congress .
so he put the pen down .
but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the white house .
but i must say , the older i &apos;ve gotten , the more i realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man .
and they &apos;re not quite what you might expect from our marble monument .
but it so happened he was speaking in a protestant church .
well , though my father died of a sudden heart attack when i was still in my 20s , before i had gotten married and had my three sons , i have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys .
the story begins in the iran-iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of iraq by foreign forces , the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change .
it &apos;s a central document in jewish history .
the greek historian xenophon wrote his book &quot; cyropaedia &quot; promoting cyrus as the great ruler .
and so in isaiah , we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this , not to marduk but to the lord god of israel -- the lord god of israel who also called cyrus by name , also takes cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people .
then another iran-iraq war .
it is a document that can mean so many things , for iran and for the region .
it was hard to believe there were any children there at all , yet the director showed me into room after room , each containing row upon row of cots , in each of which lay a child staring into space .
now , there are less than 10,000 , and family support services are provided across the country .
maybe i can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference .
and we didn &apos;t have money for the flight .
76 countries in the last 12 years , i &apos;ve visited .
and it was 8 : 00 am when i stood there .
and unicef , god bless them , they said , &quot; okay , we &apos;ll have a go . &quot;
and i got home , and i remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the taliban .
we have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce , go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities , both domestically and internationally , ever recorded .
it &apos;s all about partnerships .
the patient &apos;s cut open , twice .
now , my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in ghana occurred when i was 16 years old .
they wanted us to be analytical .
now , while i was at microsoft , this funny thing happened .
and this is true across sub-saharan africa , actually .
but the conversation they &apos;re having now -- about what their good society should look like , what their excellent society should look like , is a really good thing .
i believe that africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent .
there was so much to learn .
behind him there was a child , his son , red in the face in an effort to push the father .
and there was some staff too .
and slowly , slowly week after week his legs were improving .
and i will never forget mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair .
and then he added something i will never forget for the rest of my life .
i remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling .
so you do vocational training , home education for those who cannot go to school .
how do we find planets -- even habitable planets -- around other stars ? by looking for tiny dimming as a planet passes in front of its sun , ted fellow lucianne walkowicz and the kepler mission have found some 1,200 potential new planetary systems . with new techniques , they may even find ones with the right conditions for life .
good morning .
oh , they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods .
he &apos;s saying to me , &apos; electricity . &apos; was he an electrician ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
very simply won .
now that is true . that is what homeopathy is all about .
she did accept and then backed away .
livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation , air and water pollution , water shortages and loss of biodiversity .
we don &apos;t need animal products , and we certainly don &apos;t need white bread or coke .
and with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease , kindness might just be a bit of a red herring .
there was no marketing . there were no national brands .
i , for one -- and i &apos;m not kidding -- didn &apos;t eat real spinach or broccoli till i was 19 .
it wasn &apos;t all bad .
and as evidence that things can actually change , you can now find organic food in supermarkets , and even in fast-food outlets .
but don &apos;t we need meat to be big and strong ?
we have to choose that path .
on the weekend , your choice .
i &apos;ve talked for three minutes .
i think that &apos;s a big , big problem .
intellectual capacity -- let &apos;s take that box , which falls into a lot of different sub-categories : memory , concentration , mental energy , intelligence , empathy .
&lt; transcript &gt;
i try to refine them down to very simple forms .
you can always be changing colors , put aluminum paint , or i could put anything into this .
because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we &apos;re familiar with in biology , it &apos;s also making other forms that we &apos;re not familiar with .
how do you stage an international art show with work from 100 different artists ? if you &apos;re shea hembrey , you invent all of the artists and artwork yourself -- from large-scale outdoor installations to tiny paintings drawn with a single-haired brush . watch this funny , mind-bending talk to see the explosion of creativity and diversity of skills a single artist is capable of .
so i thought , okay , i have to have some criteria of how to choose work .
so now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you .
well this has sparked a craze in japan , because everyone &apos;s wanting a masterpiece .
sylvia &apos;s interested in art training .
he is interested in how we see as an animal , how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage .
it was so funny having a fake person who was making fake things .
next is by vera sokolova .
you know , it &apos;s very old . this is a plate from 1797 .
the first law is two-colorability . you can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting .
i start with my idea . i abstract it .
i can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements .
do a little more complicated instrument . &quot;
folded lens , you divide up the panels , you add flexures .
the airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects -- things with legs .
the &apos; 20s and the &apos; 60s also come to mind .
it was young , single women who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood .
women enter the workplace at the top , and then at the working class , all the new jobs that are created are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home .
noah : why ? they were just not listening to the class while the girls sat there very nicely .
and if women failed to birth male children , they were basically treated like domestic servants .
there &apos;s no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables .
yb : so , wind power , solar power -- we had a lot to talk about .
so i became interested in understanding what contributed to a life that was worth living .
and then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines .
now , when that happens , he says the music just flows out .
and we can measure this very precisely , actually , because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day , and whenever they go off you say what you &apos;re doing , how you feel , where you are , what you &apos;re thinking about .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world .
i was in shanghai recently , and i listened to what &apos;s happening in china , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will catch up , just as japan did .
the whole emerging world joins the western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion .
we get told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor .
ted turner &apos;s got it . steve jobs has it .
my dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale .
so i learned that lesson at a young age .
but it paid the bills .
and they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in .
that was back in 1954 , 55 years ago .
your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that &apos;s ready to take over at the time of injury . it happens every day .
this is actually an engineered blood vessel .
and the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy .
for the kidney , as i talked to you about the first painting that you saw , the first slide i showed you , 90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney , 90 percent .
but actually method a is the correct approach .
we have professionalized liberal arts to the point where they no longer provide the breadth of application and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement that is their signature .
and that was only the beginning .
the idea is to make the political-social challenges themselves -- from health and education to the uses of force -- the organizers of the curriculum .
the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil , but between competing goods .
president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
&quot; ... youngest republican , &quot; okay , we &apos;re finished .
that &apos;s the thing i want you to think about them .
but there &apos;s also a dialogue between the videos , where , once the basic structure is established , it becomes a kind of platform for articulating the similarities and differences between the groups &apos; social and physical worlds .
okay , for a second example , think about this cultural hero , icon on the left , creator of this character .
i then got this email from youtube weirdly notifying me that there was content in that owned by the mysterious wmg that matched their content id .
not a single example of reform has been produced yet .
the brain works by association .
and my company , owl built a system called guide for the apple macintosh .
there was a guy called dick rowe who was at decca records and turned down the beatles .
as a cyber-magician , i combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
joker : whoa . mt : are you ready for your party piece ?
the post-crisis projection that &apos;s just a decade away .
and what does it mean ?
the chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
so there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in china , which i suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the three gorges dam and many other expressions of state competence within china .
china already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
accelerometers on each hand read hand position .
i can &apos;t do anything to save the world . &quot;
then when the photo left , the frame was still there .
are they so different ?
&quot; oh , we &apos;re actually doing an art project and we are placing an israeli and a palestinian doing the same job .
i just took their pictures and pasted them .
i took more photos , and we started the project .
don &apos;t you have color in france ? &quot;
in india it was just impossible to paste .
so we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project .
so for example , i pasted the photo of the minaret in switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country .
and this starts right now and depends on you .
it allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways .
and you &apos;re going to the mountains to ski , you get different accessories put on the car for doing that sort of thing .
so creating craigslist or itunes and the iphone developer network , there are all these networks -- facebook as well .
so a lot of what we see in the mesh , and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define , refine and scale .
i got popular , but i was scared i &apos;d get caught again .
however , an 18 year-old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter .
i quit my job at the papers , i closed my school , and i wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks , and i decided to go traveling .
that &apos;s pepe linares , the renowned flamenco singer .
and i wondered how they did it from so close .
she made enough money , she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers , a company , everything , and she became my manager .
i could not live this larger than life person .
so , i decided it was time to end and go back home .
so i said , okay .
with institutions established to think about the future , the imf , the bis , the financial stability forum , couldn &apos;t see what was coming .
fantastic potential for regenerative medicine .
go get it , girl .
and employers who kept complaining that the kids coming out of school weren &apos;t actually ready for real work , didn &apos;t have the right attitudes and experience .
from the eg conference : productivity guru tim ferriss &apos; fun , encouraging anecdotes show how one simple question -- &quot; what &apos;s the worst that could happen ? &quot; -- is all you need to learn to do anything .
but actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left , maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible .
ended up doing translation work at age 16 when i returned to the u.s. , and have continued to apply this material over method approach to close to a dozen languages now .
one of the most elegant dancers of his generation , known for his long steps , and his tempo changes and his pivots .
sw : much better . well , einstein is very honored to be here at ted 2006 , amongst all you modern-day einsteins . in fact , she &apos;s very excited .
e : &#91; squawks &#93; sw : yeah , it sure can . but when einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public , she loves to take in the arts .
e : yee haw .
sw : and the rooster ?
but if you know anything about the history of britannica since 1962 , it was anything but radical : still a very completely safe , stodgy type of encyclopedia .
or &quot; who does that ? &quot; and the answer is : anybody who wants to pitch in .
time magazine recently reported that &quot; extreme action sometimes has to be taken , and wales locked the entries on kerry and bush for most of 2004 . &quot;
and people can get rss feeds -- they can get e-mail notifications of changes .
but you can imagine there &apos;s a lot of other areas where the question is , is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia ?
i give this talk sometimes with angela , who was just re-elected to the board from the community -- to the board of the foundation , with more than twice the votes of the person who didn &apos;t make it .
jimmy , you mentioned impartiality being a key to wikipedia &apos;s success .
his name was jasaw chan k &apos;awiil .
pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you .
wild is love .
and indeed , it has all of the characteristics of addiction .
and there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another , that psychologists can tell you .
as soon as one guy looks up , the other guy will look away .
it was one of the titles that i was sort of thinking about calling my record , except there &apos;s a couple of problems .
he is over the english channel and underway .
there is no handle , no steering nothing ?
that &apos;s the real important thing about safety .
and then i stabilize , and according to my altitude , i continue on two or three engines .
i bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better .
worryingly , there is no consensus about what it is .
but we know about those things .
so , were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates ?
this easy variability is the sign of a bad explanation , because , without a functional reason to prefer one of countless variants , advocating one of them , in preference to the others , is irrational .
that the truth consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world .
i &apos;m short sighted . i look at the signs at the end , i can hardly see them .
and the answer to that is research .
please enjoy .
and here &apos;s a picture of sick ice .
this very whale right here could be over 250 years old .
so after five days of crossing the drake passage -- isn &apos;t that beautiful .
so then she &apos;d get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this .
thank you .
suppose that two american friends are traveling together in italy .
and please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you are right of center or conservative .
that you find across cultures and even across species ?
to think about culture variation , let &apos;s try a different metaphor .
you picked a particular breed , you learned some new information about the breed .
it shoots up and it keeps going up .
they want change and justice , even at the risk of chaos .
but before you feel superior to george bush , before you throw a stone , ask yourself , do you accept this ?
and a lot of these deployments that we &apos;re actually sending military personnel to these days aren &apos;t traditional wars .
now there &apos;s a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons , some of which are obviously available now , some of which they &apos;re developing .
and one study that i found , a particularly interesting one , was actually in queensland , because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly .
this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms , but it &apos;s being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems .
i confess , this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this .
so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons , what on earth would make you think it &apos;s going to be better with military personnel ?
so makers are enthusiasts ; they &apos;re amateurs ; they &apos;re people who love doing what they do .
choir : when you hold me in your arms dd : this is all computer-controlled in an old volvo .
it didn &apos;t just exist .
let me say that again : playing .
and they do interesting things .
you might be wondering why i &apos;m wearing sunglasses , and one answer to that is , because i &apos;m here to talk about glamour .
not a metaphorical one , the way we use it today , but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent , celtic magic .
and i think that that &apos;s starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is .
so you can do a glamorized picture of a car , but you can &apos;t do a glamorized picture of traffic .
the sense of , you know , life could be better , i could join this -- i could be a perfect person , i could join this perfect world .
you know , you buy that viking range , this is what your kitchen will look like .
this is from &quot; triumph of the will &quot; -- brilliant editing to cut together things .
eve ensler : suddenly , my body
i didn &apos;t heed it ; no , i organized it and i directed it .
it became entertainment ; it became a new kind of commodity , something i was selling .
now i am swimming in it .
and the other women sang and they prayed for me and my mother .
it was all these things .
they &apos;re mit undergraduates .
and he takes this one .
and we can compare that to another case , where everything in the real world is the same .
i mean , you &apos;re clearly an incredible human being , but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not-torture chamber , do acts that people here might be worried about .
and so i &apos;ll take you to wichita , kansas , where i was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site , right downtown by the river .
these are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights , and at night , and on opening day .
and i said , &quot; this just doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s the headquarters for the institute of peace in washington , the u.s. institute of peace .
he who seeks gratification shall be disappointed .
so the way i perceive a mistake when i &apos;m on the bandstand -- first of all , we don &apos;t really see it as a mistake .
so how does this all relate to behavioral finance ?
because it has provoked , and does provoke , a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a western soul , especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens but there are many other dimensions to pakistan .
our collective vision at naya jeevan , which for many of you , as you all recognize , means &quot; new life &quot; in urdu and hindi , is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care .
now , when i talk about the northeast monsoon season , i &apos;m sure many of you here know exactly what i mean , but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure .
but i &apos;m not going to talk about that .
and there is a front between them , and the front moves .
16,000 kilometers , four generations , mind you , for a two inch long insect . it &apos;s quite incredible .
i talked about spaghetti sauce .
and for norden as well , this device had incredible moral importance , because norden was a committed christian .
well it turns out that carl norden , as a proper swiss , was very enamored of german engineers .
we think the things we make can solve our problems , but our problems are much more complex than that .
i built -- i put a garage-door opener up in the attic that would pull this door up .
so again , like the internet compared to aol , and the sort of chat rooms and content on aol at the time , what &apos;s happening here is something very different , because the sheer scale of what people can do when they &apos;re enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing .
the answer is no , and i think the reason why is because the web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up .
that said , the evolution of , and the nuanced interaction that creates culture , is happening at 10 times the speed of the real world , and in an environment where , if you walk into a bar in second life , 65 percent of the people there are not in the united states , and in fact are speaking their , you know , various and different languages .
so , no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior or political behavior is going to keep these technology changes from connecting us together , because the basic motive that people have -- to be creative and entrepreneurial -- is going to drive energy into these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the web .
well , that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life .
however , this is not enough . those are just auxiliary , help conditions .
with loving kindness , with patience , with openness ?
and just , i leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than i could ever say .
and given that we do -- and that &apos;s the assumption everybody , i think , in this room would make -- when was that ?
digging things up out of the ground , and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped , often skull shape -- saying , &quot; this looks a little bit more like us than that , so this must be my ancestor .
because what we &apos;re really asking is a genealogical problem , or a genealogical question .
but when it does happen , and these changes get transmitted down through the generations , they become markers of descent .
why was it that we seem to have come out of africa so recently ?
the ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right .
now , that story i just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world , the great paleolithic wanderings of our species .
the most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public ; 210,000 people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago , which has raised around five million dollars , the majority of which , at least half , is going back into the legacy fund .
and they &apos;re being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals , who are linked by trade , travel , and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity .
and at first , it &apos;s just a blur , but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur .
stars will create the goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds .
why ?
it &apos;s accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work .
we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift .
we &apos;re burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years .
i would predict , if you &apos;re a representative sample , that many more of you insure your iphones than your lives , even when you have kids .
take out those who say they save too little .
twelve percent do .
it &apos;s a lot more fun to spend now .
this is a real difference .
the other said , &quot; how much did we hire him for ? &quot;
and the studio executives , they would say , &quot; hey , look at shekhar . he &apos;s so prepared . &quot;
and let &apos;s go to the universe because there &apos;s something out there that is more truthful than your mind , that is more truthful than your universe .
and when that ax hits that piece of wood , that &apos;s when everything will destroy and the big bang will happen again .
i often wonder when i make a film -- i &apos;m thinking of making a film of the buddha -- and i often wonder : if buddha had all the elements that are given to a director -- if he had music , if he had visuals , if he had a video camera -- would we get buddhism better ?
they said , &quot; we won the armada . &quot;
elizabeth : traitorous .
elizabeth has realized , and she &apos;s coming face-to-face with her own sense of jealousy , her own sense of mortality .
i suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster .

and he orders a pint , and they sit in silence for a while .
that &apos;s not by chance , that &apos;s by design .
that &apos;s your job as a storyteller , is to hide the fact that you &apos;re making them work for their meal .
and woody &apos;s was to do what was best for his child .
and it &apos;s interesting to see how that led us places that were actually pretty good .
slinky : i &apos;m sorry , woody , but i have to agree with them .
look .
i don &apos;t know if my parents really believe that , but i didn &apos;t want to prove them wrong .
it &apos;s a choice . you might end up driving a taxicab .
we paid two to three times more than anybody else .
now we &apos;re at 1.3 .
should you be able to buy a product that &apos;s sustainable sitting next to one that isn &apos;t , or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable ?
even if we get everybody working on it , we &apos;ve got to be strategic .
and what we found is it &apos;s 25 percent .
for the big companies , it &apos;s reputational risk , but more importantly , they don &apos;t care what the price of commodities is .
now most people understand that mars is a chocolate company , but mars has made sustainability pledges to buy only certified product for all of its seafood .
we &apos;re all on that same journey with them .
they taught me about what a strong marriage feels like : that it &apos;s built on faith and commitment and an admiration for each other &apos;s unique gifts .

with pisa , we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity , in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances .
they invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things .
a lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage .
would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer ?
in bureaucratic school systems , teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching .
but pisa has shown what &apos;s possible in education .
they are pictured here for their 25th anniversary newsweek retrospective on the internet .
it &apos;s just part of your neighborly duty .
one of the most popular websites in the world , run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that youtube or google were particularly privileged to do about it .
i am not making this up .
they &apos;re realizing that they have to take responsibility for what they do .
this one says , &quot; bucolic meadow with split-rail fence .

but in st. john &apos;s , i was in the lower quarter .
and india was up to 89 years more of foreign domination .
and japan is trying to move up there .
it was central planning by mao tse tung .
the geographical , macro-geographical difference is not so big .
whereas u.k. and united states is getting richer and richer .
so , social investments in health , education and infrastructure , and electricity is really what is needed in india and china .
and in the end , there &apos;s better bargaining between the authorities and citizens , and democracies , capitalism -- everything else flourished .
and he wasn &apos;t there , so i walked all afternoon back .
but in any event , it &apos;s connectivity that leads to dependability .

and write to me on kiranbedi.com , and i &apos;ll respond to you .
that thing is called a captcha .
so what you may not know is that nowadays while you &apos;re typing a captcha , not only are you authenticating yourself as a human , but in addition you &apos;re actually helping us to digitize books .
so we get this .
okay , that &apos;s severin hacker .
so we need people to translate the whole web .
first of all , people are really , really learning a language .
so here &apos;s the site . thank you .

and then the cliche came to haunt us .
it didn &apos;t leave it up to the supreme court to decide ; the people did .
i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them .

they were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century , the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats , so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place .
this was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple .

we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don &apos;t stabilize the world population .
but many people see the same thing and think things differently , and one of them is here , ratan tata .
and of course , nothing succeeds like success ; the cynics then turned around , and one after the other they also started saying , &quot; yes , we also want to make a car in the nano segment .
it was an open innovation , ideas from all over were welcome .

conception to birth -- visualized
the marvel of this information : how do we actually have this biological mechanism inside our body to actually see this information ?
so , the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with not only the idea realm , but also with very much the feeling realm .
so , i had this wishbone , and i thought , it &apos;s kind of like a cowboy who &apos;s been on his horse for too long .
and this one i call &quot; machine with grease . &quot;
it means nothing at all .
and i thought , well maybe there is lithium-6 in this star , which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet .
cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees .
and later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything strange with these objects .
because can you imagine everything boiling ?
and then we will need another 10 , 15 years with space projects to get the spectra of earth-like planets like the one i showed you .
so i &apos;m a researcher-storyteller , and i &apos;m going to talk to you today -- we &apos;re talking about expanding perception -- and so i want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that i live and love and work and parent .
and it turned out to be shame .
what do these people have in common ?

when we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box , we use an incremental design , build , test , redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps .
advertising adds value to a product by changing our perception , rather than the product itself . rory sutherland makes the daring assertion that a change in perceived value can be just as satisfying as what we consider &quot; real &quot; value -- and his conclusion has interesting consequences for how we look at life .
someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further , and actually produce placebo education .
now , boring people would have just simply banned the veil .
because actually , never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry . this actually had symbolic value , badge value .
in the world of food we call it cooking .
now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible , added value , without changing the product in the slightest .
there were conservative elements in canada , unsurprisingly , who actually resented this intrusion .
but after one week of practicing , my throws became more like this .
now that , i suggest , is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously .

natalie macmaster and her musical partner donnell leahy play several tunes from the cape breton tradition -- a sprightly , soulful style of folk fiddling . it &apos;s an inspired collaboration that will have you clapping along .
we learned to play the instruments , but we kind of had to come from within or go from within , because we didn &apos;t watch television , we didn &apos;t listen to a lot of radio . we went to church and to school sometimes , and farmed and played music , so we were able , i think , at a very critical age to develop our own style , our own self , and my mother plays , my father plays , and the style that came from the ottawa valley in ontario , we call it french-canadian style but it originated in logging camps .

this is , of course , unless your whole life is about being secure .
your days become devoted to protecting yourself .
their own personal security is not their end goal , and because of that , because , rather than worrying about security , because the transformation of suffering is their end goal , i actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security .

well , it looks like i &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , julian , be careful , and all power to you .
that means that it is the numbers that control the form , not me .
and not everyone has a ph.d. in science .
i thought this would be easy , but i emailed about 200 different people within a five-hour radius of where i lived , and i got one positive response that said that they could work with me .
my older brother panaki bose spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me when i barely understood basic algebra .
so that was my work , and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research , with figuring out exactly what this protein does , but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness -- so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren .
which is surprising to me , because these chemical pollutants , through my research , i show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated .
your google science fair champions .
my generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of china that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
and she claimed to be the general manager of red cross at the chamber of commerce .
and you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
for the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
and after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
interesting .
i learned this firsthand with my next adventure .
i think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity , we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have .
the complaint was that their chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes and flew themselves into the walls of the barn when the airplanes flew over the land .
there &apos;s only you in my life ...
it failed partly because the courts are too passive , partly because the legislatures are corrupted , by which i don &apos;t mean that there &apos;s bribery operating to stop real change , but more the economy of influence that governs how congress functions means that policymakers here will not understand this until it &apos;s too late to fix it .
juan enriquez on genomics and our future
and by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse and how important and how interesting this journey into life is , and how many different life forms there are , and how there can be different life forms living in very different places , maybe even outside of this planet .
that &apos;s one of the deadliest diseases known to humans .
mice and men are the same . wives know that , but anyway .
well , in southern california it &apos;s happening in 92121 . and that &apos;s it .
country after country is splitting , seceding , succeeding , failing -- and it &apos;s all getting very fragmented . and this has not stopped .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
think enron , madoff , the mortgage crisis .
we &apos;re against lying , but we &apos;re covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries .
why is it so easy to learn ?
they &apos;re going to be willing to brainstorm , name suspects , provide details .
your new joint venture partner might shake your hand , celebrate , go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger .
that bothers me the most .
this is a video i made when i first started doing toy design .
and you know , lego -- don &apos;t take legos to lego .
there &apos;s some kind of a blend that happens that allows , you know , to find innovation .
no , it &apos;s a little robot on heroin or something , i think .
and the cams i got cut at hewlett packard .
there &apos;s a kind of truncated camarasaurus skeleton , but the geometry &apos;s correct .
there you go .
my first trip in india , i was in a person &apos;s home where they had dirt floors , no running water , no electricity , and that &apos;s really what i see all over the world .
they have a whole team called &quot; knowledge and insight . &quot;
they decided that wasn &apos;t good enough , so they went to india and studied the indian state of kerala that also had a system like this , and they adapted it for ethiopia .
let &apos;s listen to this song that coke created for it , &quot; wavin &apos; flag &quot; by a somali hip hop artist .
one state in northern india has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship .
this year on august 8th , he felt paralysis and on the 13th , his parents took him to the doctor .
to me , that is deep happiness .
what have we learned from these places ?
and this is what i saw , lots of fish .
you can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up .
the estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience .
the stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going .
we go there to try to understand the ecosystems , to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know .
notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
i put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
and what you &apos;re seeing here is a cloud of densely packed , hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor .
and then there &apos;s earthquakes , and then volcanic eruptions , on the order of one every five years , that completely wipes the area out .
most of the population growth of the next 50 years will be in cities .
ten years ago , they certainly would have been married .
our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff , but you have to wait quite a long time .
so the trendiest schools in the world , high tech high and others , they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity .
they fail to reach the people they most need to serve .
it &apos;s an amazing thing .
how do we live it successfully ?
as you may know , the entire world operates on a universal law : entropy , the second law of thermodynamics .
how did they treat my parents ?
it helps us become what we might have been .
evolution works that way .
and darwin said , looking at this flower , &quot; i guess something has coevolved with this . &quot;
i actually smelt someone with some on earlier .
and that &apos;s twice the energy output , weight for weight , than a hummingbird -- this thing does something else which is unusual .
just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot ; it was just attached to the tripod , not killed -- then under ultraviolet light , look at that .
and you &apos;ll see everybody waking up on the east coast , followed by european flights coming in the upper right-hand corner .
and we set this up as a live globe in the museum of modern art in new york for the design the elastic mind exhibition .
but what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re just doing these little labors ?
sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts , the first to be selectively bred for production traits , the first animal to be cloned .
this is again showing all the different contributions .
and i was writing software to visualize laser scanners .
and i just thought it &apos;d be wonderful , it &apos;d be really nice to contribute something to his memory .
it &apos;s an online music video for the arcade fire .
and i don &apos;t remember papercutting as a child .
so i did a series of work where it was identical words in french and in english .
other ones are historical .
i started with small images , i started with a few miles .
it &apos;s called &quot; fashion statement , &quot; and there are quotes about fashion , so you can read it , and also , because the definition of artist book is very generous .
i also planted the bibliotree .
and along the way , i &apos;m kind of making papercuttings and adding other techniques .
it &apos;s probably , at my speed , at my age -- for anybody &apos;s speed at anybody &apos;s age -- going to take 60 , maybe 70 , hours of continuous swimming , never getting out on the boat .
and i knew i could do it .
they either die or they quickly get to a hospital .
we &apos;ve all had a heartache .
why we might be victims of these career crises , as we &apos;re weeping softly into our pillows .
in other words -- feel sympathy , rather than contempt .
it &apos;s probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as bill gates , as it was unlikely in the 17th century that you would accede to the ranks of the french aristocracy .
there are more suicides in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world .
and then are fit for ridicule .
and that &apos;s why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans , and contemplating the earth from outside its perimeters , etc .
but what i really want to stress is by all means , success , yes .
any guesses ? 1816 .
now , what i &apos;ve talked about are physiologic metrics .
what if we could reduce the need for hospital beds ?
and it says , &quot; how hard was it ? &quot;
so , it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group .
and this article from the economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world : &quot; mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people , more quickly , than any previous technology . &quot;
and finally , another example : sudden cardiac death .
education : how do we improve education ?
the plot of the book is that there &apos;s not enough diversity , so that the people who designed the city make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created .
and one of the things laurie garrett pointed out , and others have , is that a society that doesn &apos;t have people of working age is in real trouble . and things are going to get worse , because there &apos;s nobody to educate the children or to feed the old .
and there is a way the world both envisions food , the way the world writes about food and learns about food .
this shaped wok doesn &apos;t work very well ; this caught fire three times .
i said , &quot; it would have to show up free . &quot;
as you move side to side , it moves off .
now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that &apos;s why you shouldn &apos;t get shot .
but you think to yourself , &quot; i &apos;m not quite sure what &apos;s wrong with this guy .
i mean who would put themselves through that ?
so what you see -- this is now the first surgical image -- as we &apos;re coming down the tube , this is a new entry into the body .
and there are some reasons , some good reasons .
it &apos;s not so simple .
these maladies come for us all .
agricultural workers in africa , whipped and beaten , showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew .
we needed medicine .
one of their mothers said to us , &quot; you know , we can &apos;t survive here , but we can &apos;t even seem to die either . &quot;
we have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch , and end up as second class citizens .
the film that we &apos;re about to see is a film they made for the moscow world &apos;s fair .
and this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation .
its early version had an &quot; x &quot; base . that &apos;s what the collectors like .
the &quot; powers of ten &quot; is a film they made .
you can see me , i have the same haircut , in the upper right corner .
kymaerica with waterfalls , tumbling through our -- ed : this is one of the traditional kymaerican songs .
but here is what &apos;s really great .
and i really think that &apos;s where we are .
but the picture isn &apos;t always perfect , as we all know , and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor .
so , we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet .
it takes an entire civilization to build a toaster . designer thomas thwaites found out the hard way , by attempting to build one from scratch : mining ore for steel , deriving plastic from oil ... it &apos;s frankly amazing he got as far as he got . a parable of our interconnected society , for designers and consumers alike .
and mica is a mineral which is a very good insulator and very good at insulating electricity .
and it &apos;s not just computation .
but what &apos;s even more amazing , really , than this fantastic scale of progress , is that -- look at how predictable this is .
and this has been a smooth progression since the beginning of the genome project .
what used to take up a building now fits in our pockets .
james surowiecki : when social media became news
when what was a tranquil sea swallows up people , homes and long-tail boats -- mercilessly , without warning -- and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming , i &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want to calm down either .
the second is , do blogs genuinely have the possibility of accessing a kind of collective intelligence that has previously remained , for the most part , untapped ?
dan gillmor -- whose book &quot; we the media &quot; is included in the gift pack -- has talked about it as saying that , as a writer , he &apos;s recognized that his readers know more than he does .
and what happens is that the ants eventually end up in a circle .
that &apos;s an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . &quot;
going to scratch his nose .
now most of us , and i would say me included , think that human exploitation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last 50 to , perhaps , 100 years or so .
and what barcoding does is use a specific gene called co1 that &apos;s consistent within a species , but varies among species .
this is a location in the pacific where white shark converge .
and so the grand challenge then is to try and make sure that we preserve what &apos;s left , because there is still spectacular beauty .
they &apos;re perfect .
if there &apos;s one operation for a disease , you know it works .
and if there &apos;s anything that has permeated this room , it is precisely that .
we have seen that here today with the sense , with the sensitivity -- and in the last three days , and with the power of the indomitable human spirit .
there &apos;s no competition at all .
but more generally , this noise is something that corrupts the signal .
and what it really says , and what you want to estimate , is the probability of different beliefs given your sensory input .
now i get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act .
they predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off .
and i can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration either very stiff or very relaxed .
and one intuition to get is actually the amount of noise or variability i show here gets bigger as the force gets bigger .
it &apos;s totally appropriate for a four-year-old .
just beautiful .
there &apos;s a whole gray market for lego , thousands of home-based businesses .
it &apos;s a dead world . nasa should not spend any time or effort studying mars anymore . &quot;
these images that show at one time , there was very fast flowing water on the surface of mars .
there aren &apos;t many craters .
main engine start , and liftoff .
we are prepared to fly this on mars , rewrite the textbook about mars .
two years ago , the ceo , lee scott , believed that green is the next big thing , and so wal-mart made going green a top priority .
it is stupid that we use two tons of steel , glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall .
they &apos;d run ethanol or ordinary gasoline .
i guess that &apos;s better living through bugs .
energy &apos;s a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide .
and you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity , in which we &apos;re all embedded .
you might see that people occupy different locations within the network .
and in fact , if you could do that , what you would see is something like this .
we took 1,300 randomly selected undergraduates , we had them nominate their friends , and we followed both the random students and their friends daily in time to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic .
information spreads in populations , norms can spread in populations , behaviors can spread in populations .
and in fact , we are in the era of what i would call &quot; massive-passive &quot; data collection efforts .
thank you .
this clearly devastated me , and i couldn &apos;t help but wonder about the fate of my old friends , the winged bulls , and the fate of the many , many heritage sites all over the world .
imagine us as a human race not knowing where we came from .
this is all in 3d and of course you can fly through the cloud of points .
two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in rwanda .
they &apos;ve lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide .
so this movement , if it &apos;s to be durable and global , will have to cross borders , and you will have to see other citizens in democracies , not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide , but actually making it such .
started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the &apos; 70s were wars of independence and decolonization .
but nonetheless , he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in , again , the world &apos;s worst places .
but by the end of his life , i think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from .
how sisyphean this task was of mending , and yet aware of that complexity , humbled by it , he wasn &apos;t paralyzed by it .
some are driven by compassion , feel it &apos;s perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity .
we actually have the technology and systems .
i &apos;d like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is .
when disaster strikes -- the economy gets blown , people lose a job , floods , war , conflict , bad governance , all of those things -- there is nothing to fall back on .
you manage , the village manages these warehouses .
perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that bill gates , howard buffett and others have supported boldly , which is to ask the question : what if , instead of looking at the hungry as victims -- and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families -- what if we view them as the solution , as the value chain to fight hunger ?
and the world can come in with enabling environments and opportunities to do this .
we &apos;ve made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia , where we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission , but in general , we haven &apos;t made an impact at all in the war on cancer .
but , if we start to understand that cancer isn &apos;t just a molecular defect , it &apos;s something more , then we &apos;ll get to new ways of treating it , as i &apos;ll show you .
and i &apos;m here to tell you , it &apos;s wrong .
earlier it was referred to this direct life device .
there &apos;s all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes , that if you give this cancer drug , you can do this effect to the cell , but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near the doses that happen in the body .
she had gotten carboplatin taxol , carboplatin taxotere , gemcitabine , navelbine : every drug we have she had gotten , and that disease continued to grow .
would it have been 10 centimeters , or am i giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost ?
we need a radically different approach .
music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state .
i want to spend just a moment talking about the model that we &apos;ve developed , which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound , analyze the soundscape and then predict the four outcomes i &apos;ve just talked about .
that &apos;s an order of magnitude , up or down .
so , this theory is that the brain creates , builds , a version of the universe , and projects this version of the universe , like a bubble , all around us .
the mammals needed it because they had to cope with parenthood , social interactions , complex cognitive functions .
but it &apos;s a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication , the rules of connectivity , because the neurons don &apos;t just like to connect with any neuron .
so , the fabric of the brain , even though your brain may be smaller , bigger , it may have different types of neurons , different morphologies of neurons , we actually do share and we think this is species-specific , which means that that could explain why we can &apos;t communicate across species .
ultimately it &apos;s got to be there if we stimulated it with it .
you &apos;ll be in a massive headwind .
where do you sleep ? we slept in a tent that was very low to the ground , because the winds on antarctica were so extreme , it would blow anything else away .
sylvia earle &apos;s ted prize wish to protect our oceans
i heard astronaut joe allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system ; and then he pointed to this and he said , &quot; life support system . &quot;
and with caring , there &apos;s hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us .
that &apos;s bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton .
there &apos;s still time , but not a lot , to turn things around .
there are still places in the sea as pristine as i knew as a child .
&lt; transcript &gt;
the people who worked on it were a lot of the los alamos people who had done the hydrogen bomb work .
these are stills from film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn &apos;t and kept it in their basement for the last 40 years .
the scientists were still going to go along ; they would take seven astronauts and seven scientists .
not yours , of course -- other people &apos;s .
which i think is just fascinating .
there is no way for us not to see this illusion .
and finally , depending on your particular version of european similarity , you can think about the u.k and france as either similar culturally or not .
when you walk into the dmv , the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you &apos;ll end up doing .
and then they said to half the physicians , they said , &quot; yesterday you reviewed the patient &apos;s case and you realized that you forgot to try one medication .
it &apos;s like having your car stolen . it &apos;s an inferior option .
which is why we have these four-minute dates .
we build steps . and we build these things that not everybody can use obviously .
and we are simply running out of spectrum .
it &apos;s light , and light has been around for many millions of years .
you all know remote controls have an infrared led -- basically you switch on the led , and if it &apos;s off , you switch it off .
once again .
these are potential sources for high-speed data transmission .
there are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin , and each of these lights could be a potential transmitter of wireless data .
i thought i &apos;d take a moment to tell you what a genome is .
so , if you look at a human genome , they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs . that &apos;s a lot .
and then james watson &apos;s -- one of the co-founders of dna -- genome was done for two million dollars , and in just two months .
we are now not just reading genomes ; we are writing them .
we could produce better flavors and aromas .
and , you know , people would always ask james watson -- he &apos;s not always the most politically correct guy ...
thank you .
so , this whole dominance issue -- number one , what we get in dog training is this mickey-mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system .
my wife doesn &apos;t need food -- she &apos;s a great trainer , much better than i am .
so now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training .
and i only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house , and they never took it outside .
i &apos;m standing right here with my bag .
that is such a powerful training technique .
turn your head this way ; shoot ; and you &apos;re bound to kill something .
two-thirds of it is already dedicated -- that &apos;s the white band below -- the thing you said isn &apos;t important -- is already dedicated to social functions . &quot;
so it &apos;s an unusual building for a public library , obviously .
it &apos;s almost as though the building could be placed anywhere : wherever you place it , the area underneath it is charged for theatrical performances .
and it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building .
that allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency .
biological -- there &apos;s autoimmune diseases , where the body attacks itself a little too overzealously and destroys the host , or the person .
&lt; transcript &gt;
wk : yeah . i test .
thank you so much for coming .
and here is one of my paintings .
&lt; transcript &gt;
there was no progress , no innovation .
he doesn &apos;t need adam .
it isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
what happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize ?
because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
they &apos;re tiny . they &apos;re barely visible as a piece of material , and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas that was larger than any printer in the world would print .
and so , as you stand back , you see 213,000 vicodin pills , which is the number of hospital emergency room visits yearly in the united states , attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers and anti-anxiety medications .
thank you and good afternoon .
we took our chip over to hewlett-packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots , and this is what you see : you can actually see the strands of dna lying flat on the glass here .
and kaposi &apos;s sarcoma-associated herpes virus gives a nice signature down here .
day zero : nothing happening .
if , for example , you used a cell culture that &apos;s chronically infected with papilloma , you get a little computer readout here , and our algorithm says it &apos;s probably papilloma type 18 .
they gave us endotracheal aspirate -- you know , a little fluid from the throat , from this tube that they got down there -- and they gave us this .
it &apos;s a classic gamma retrovirus , but it &apos;s totally new ; no one &apos;s ever seen it before .
it &apos;s not a joke yet ; those aren &apos;t the jokes .
we have very simple little weather systems you see here , very simple geology . for instance , i could open one of my tools here and then carve out rivers .
and yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking .
they &apos;re infectious .
richard dawkins , whom you &apos;ll be hearing later in the day , invented the term &quot; memes , &quot; and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book &quot; the selfish gene . &quot;
i say , &quot; well , do words exist ? are they in your ontology ? &quot;
i &apos;ve not time to go into more of it .
if you &apos;ve had a friend who &apos;s died of aids , then you hate hiv .
i can hardly bark out instructions while we &apos;re playing .
so how do we recover from that , ladies and gentlemen ?
and what i &apos;m going to say to you now is i &apos;m just urging you to get over this supreme lack of self-confidence , to take the plunge , to believe that you can trust your ears , you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue , fiber , dna , what makes a great piece of music great .
there i am like a bloody windmill again , you see .
and i was born without my left hand -- right hand .
i want to start with a story , a la seth godin , from when i was 12 years old .
who are these people ?
distribution is a nightmare , but not impossible .
william ury : the walk from &quot; no &quot; to &quot; yes &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of conflict , and the question is , how do we deal with our differences ?
and then he went on , and then he turned to me and said , &quot; you &apos;re an american .
what would that mean ? what is the story there ?
it goes across 10 different countries in the middle east , because it unites them all . &quot;
he said it was like a light that went on in our lives .
it could be done anywhere .
and what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences , private-based learning .
this is a beautiful moment .
and i &apos;d like to talk very briefly about three new inventions that will change the lives of many people .
next to it , at 30 seconds , you see this rise here , then this rise -- that &apos;s the st elevation .
and that is the typical treatment in the advanced world -- not africa -- that &apos;s the typical treatment in the advanced world today .
anchor : for anyone who suffers from migraine headaches -- and there are 30 million americans who do -- tonight : a possible answer .
form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy , as well as other diseases of the brain , because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it , that causes many , if not all , of brain disorders .
and consider treating psychotic disorders -- and i want this involved with the ted group -- such as obsessive-compulsive disorder that , presently , is not well treated with drugs , and includes five million americans .
then there &apos;s a simpler one and , oh yes , i understand that .
and so there is a team of developers from all over africa , who are part of this team now -- from ghana , from malawi , from kenya .
so we think that there is something interesting we can do here .
in the last two years of his life , when he was sick , he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me .
richard baraniuk on open-source learning
and so what i want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas that we &apos;ve seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books , using them and teaching from them .
what about copying , reusing , right ?
why does it cost 22 dollars ?
we came up with this six-and-a-half years ago because i teach the stuff in the red box .
how many people have heard of creative commons ?
connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge .
it didn &apos;t scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries , and learning pretty quickly that these kids -- even though english wasn &apos;t their language , the latin alphabet barely was their language , but they could just swim like fish ; they could play these like pianos .
and the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down , and that &apos;s why i said seven to 10 million there .
the two pieces that are probably notable is it &apos;ll be a mesh network , so when the kids open up their laptops , they all become a network , and then just need one or two points of backhaul .
and yet we count .
are we dreaming ? is this real ? it actually is real .
i was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders .
this map depicts the global distribution of hiv .
it means 1,100 children infected each day -- 1,100 children each day , infected with hiv .
i &apos;m a doctor -- i tell people things to do , and i expect them to follow my guidance -- because i &apos;m a doctor ; i went to harvard -- but the reality is , if i tell a patient , &quot; you should have safer sex .
and we open bank accounts for them and they &apos;re paid directly into the accounts , because their money &apos;s protected ; the men can &apos;t take it away from them .
we can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to hiv .
typically , it &apos;s a doctor giving a job to a nurse .
mothers with hiv caring for mothers with hiv .
that is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not intended by nature -- like taking the dna of a fish and putting it into the dna of a tomato . yuck .

this year , unfortunately the lakebed &apos;s turned into an absolute cracked dry bed .
you may have seen this in other forms , but the top line is the amount of protected area on land , globally , and it &apos;s about 12 percent .
there &apos;s actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land .
and what &apos;s the context of the phoenix islands ?
after i got back , i said , okay , this is amazing , what we found .
and conservation international had struck some of those deals .
he paused and put his hands together and said , &quot; yes , greg , but the devil will be in the details , &quot; he said .
and it turned out that -- i just went to see , you know , what they are doing in hong kong .
and they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas .
opens up at dusk and dawn every day .
and , just about at that time , an austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine ?
in october 2010 , the justice league of america will be teaming up with the 99 .
i rewrote that story , and in my version , the librarians find out that this is going to happen -- and here &apos;s a side note : if you want a comic book to do well , make the librarians the hero . it always works well .
there &apos;s a king arthur element to the storyline , okay .
i got accused in a few blogs that i was actually sent by the pope to preach the trinity and catholicism in the middle east , so you -- you believe who you want . i gave you my version of the story .
and we entered western consciousness with a tagline : &quot; next ramadan , the world will have new heroes , &quot; back in 2005 .
but the biggest thing we &apos;ve done to date , which is just amazing , is that we &apos;ve done a 26-episode animated series , which is done for global audiences : in fact , we &apos;re already going to be in the u.s. and turkey , we know .
don &apos;t we deserve to be saved ? don &apos;t i ?
and i asked the students in kuwait where they thought these incidents took place .
as an undergrad at tufts university , we were giving away free falafel one day and , you know , it was middle east day or something .
this is opec &apos;s revenue , this green box here -- 780 billion a year .
you have retrospectives , anniversaries , court cases , even copy-cat shootings , all pushing that fear into the agenda .
and here &apos;s my visual c.v .
so massive , in fact , that it can contain all the other military budgets in the world inside itself .
this is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements .
and it feels just incredibly cool to do that .
except here it &apos;s been split up in parts by estée lauder and by the perfumer who did it , calice becker , and i &apos;m most grateful to them for this .
so this fact that boranes smell of sulfur had been known since 1910 , and utterly forgotten until 1997 , 1998 .
and people often ask me , is your theory accepted ?
lemn sissay : a child of the state
the first secret of shame for a woman for being a woman , &quot; a little break . &quot;
for doing this , i was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center . it was a virtual prison for young people .
&quot; the better man . &quot;
why do they do that ? why do old ladies go to those hair shops , and make those helmets ?
stop it .
i was born in britain , as you have probably guessed .
hail to the god of america , whose power the masses extol -- convenience rules america ; convenience owns our soul .
i &apos;m not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman , who men fall down , you know , when she walks in a room .
if you &apos;re a woman , remember that .
if you go look at their website today , they &apos;ll actually list these specimens , saying , the rest was lost in a fire .
in this one , because the auction was actually so controversial , profiles in history , the auction house that sold this -- i think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars -- they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom -- not just a front elevation , but also a side , rear and other side elevation .
i &apos;ll give them one if they want it .
today , we &apos;ve got great technology : we have gps .
i could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well , because i was the same age that he was when he died .
from very primitive beginnings , with a very crude tool kit of stones , we now have a very advanced tool kit , and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels : we &apos;ve got buggies to mars ; we &apos;ve mapped the human genome ; and recently even created synthetic life , thanks to craig venter .
i hit my head on my desk . i broke my cheekbone , i got five stitches on my right eye .
it was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet .
there was another one of those comb jellies .
and i have no idea why there &apos;s two , and that &apos;s something i want to solve some day -- but not only can it see blue light , but it can see red light .
but he still knows a good thing when he sees it , and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss .
it &apos;s this pinwheel of light , and i &apos;ve done calculations that show that this could be seen from as much as 300 feet away by a predator .
and we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption : &quot; engineer satisfying two women at once . &quot;
i was hanging on to have a pee .
at that point , i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s possible at all .
when i look at these things , they look pretty normal to me .
it cost 1.7 million dollars to develop . it &apos;s called &quot; go &quot; by bernhardt , usa .
ironically , that object was made by the killarney process , which is a brand-new process here for the 21st century , and i can hear greg lynn laughing his socks off as i say that .
single-surface products . furniture &apos;s a good one .
when i showed this in south africa , everybody after was going , &quot; yeah , hey , car on a stick . like this . &quot;
it &apos;s next to david hockney &apos;s original studio .
no , it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true . people like tom and greg -- we &apos;re traveling like you can &apos;t -- we fit it all in . i don &apos;t know how we do it .
you need a lawyer to run the company , because there &apos;s so much law .
my own law firm has a list of questions that i &apos;m not allowed to ask when interviewing candidates , such as the sinister question , bulging with hidden motives and innuendo , &quot; where are you from ? &quot;
so , let &apos;s pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above .
they &apos;re threatened with a legal claim .
because it gives us the worst of both worlds : it &apos;s random -- anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury , not even an effort at consistency -- and it &apos;s also too detailed .
isaiah berlin put it this way : &quot; law sets frontiers , not artificially drawn , within which men shall be inviolable . &quot;
this is the hardest hurdle .

and ken &#91; sharpe &#93; and i certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers .
a wise person knows when to bend the rules .
he did . he served out his sentence .
you need to have incentives .
so these are little ordinary , everyday heroes , and they &apos;re incredibly admirable , but there &apos;s no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down .
well , one reason is that judge russell has now seen 108 vets in his veterans &apos; court as of february of this year , and out of 108 , guess how many have gone back through the revolving door of justice into prison .
love : managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part .
and it was an extraordinary time , and i am going to go through some of the mentality that we -- that americans and the rest of the world were experiencing .
this was bert the turtle .
here &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen if we get a nuclear hit . &quot;
that -- you &apos;d need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium .
what you saw after katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the united states is for any kind of major attack .
so , first of all , this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine .
so , response planning in the twenty-first century is both possible and is essential .
nuclear terrorism is possible -- it may be probable -- but is survivable .
right here .
but it was an exciting experience .
and if you take a look at that , this was actually in a book that i wrote that deals with artificial life .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it writes about politics or about science .
too hot , too hot .
and i think that &apos;s one of the main problems of our society .
this is very practical .
that &apos;s when you throw out all the ballast , all the certainties , in order to adapt to the new situation .
which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it .
and 20 years later there were 200 people in every airplane crossing the atlantic .
now , to assist me in explaining this , i &apos;ve enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers , the reigning king of the metaphorians , a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor .
this is the bouba / kiki test .
metaphor matters because it &apos;s around us every day , all the time .
he famously used thought experiments , which are essentially elaborate analogies , to come up with some of his greatest discoveries .
my lower half is appearing at a different conference in a different country .
we went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on .
today , every day , 9,000 more africans will catch hiv because of stigmatization and lack of education .
there is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life would be accepted anywhere else other than africa .
don &apos;t you think that on a purely commercial level , that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements for western ingenuity and technology ?
this is the straight truth , the righteous truth .
i hope this is obvious , but i &apos;m not a hippie .
i understand that .
the war against terror , yes .
i know john gage and sun microsystems are already on board for this , but there &apos;s lots of you we &apos;d like to talk to .
we can make history .
it &apos;s a very , very good idea to get them wired .
the solidarity of millions of yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing .
so since then i &apos;ve been the bridge , and a lot of people have walked over me .
and it &apos;s economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say , &quot; i am as much contributing to this family , or more , than you are . &quot;
and this is probably something i &apos;m going to share with you in western media probably -- and how there &apos;s a lot of stereotypes -- thinking of yemen in one single frame : this is what yemen is all about .
but after the two years , which is a price we are willing to pay , we are going to stand up again on our feet , but in the new yemen with a younger and more empowered people -- democratic .
i come from colorado .
though i was attached to this ugly , unwanted , high-maintenance , mechanical pet , my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera -- very complicated , but in a good way .
i officially took a break from singing , and i went to the cleveland clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years , for transplant .
if they stayed in , there was no way i would ever sing again .
tyrone hayes + penelope jagessar chaffer : the toxic baby ?
now my wife tells me , and i &apos;m sure penelope can as well , that there &apos;s nothing more painful than childbirth -- which that i &apos;ll never experience , i can &apos;t really argue that -- but i would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five .
for those of you who don &apos;t know , we &apos;re in the middle of the sixth mass extinction .
perflourooctanoic acid .
it shouldn &apos;t come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us , just like rachel carson and others have warned .
it begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge .
i wanted to see what my home town of long beach was contributing to the problem , so on coastal clean-up day in 2005 i went to the long beach peninsula , at the east end of our long beach .
all the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men ...
now , let your imagination go upward into space .
these are huckleberry bushes .
the flickering , transitory quality of human time and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love .
basit and amjad ; they are still there .
we know that online criminals are hiring programmers , hiring testing people , testing their code , having back-end systems with sql databases .
in downtown st. petersburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
we have to find the people with the skills , but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .
mother theresa , she was rational .
and harry wants to know what each of those people are saying to each other , and so on , and sally would like to know what harry thinks those people are saying .
you might notice what we don &apos;t need to know : there &apos;s no history in here .
the white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left iran to make its own internal decisions , under its own domestic political pressures .
when people say to you , &quot; that &apos;s impossible , &quot; you say back to them , &quot; when you say &apos; that &apos;s impossible , &apos; you &apos;re confused with , &apos; i don &apos;t know how to do it . &apos; &quot; thank you .
that would be a mistake .
they could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars , the sequence and direction of waves , the flight patterns of certain birds .
this i know intimately , because even as i travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them , i struggle .
two years ago , recording artist chris brown released the official video of his single &quot; forever . &quot;
i totally want to go to that wedding .
thank you .
but we all know that that &apos;s bullshit at times .
most of us don &apos;t do that , but the culture &apos;s a therapy culture .
if you &apos;re creative enough , playful enough , fun enough , can you get through to anybody ? yes or no ?
because that &apos;s about my lab . i &apos;ve had three million people from 80 different countries that i &apos;ve had a chance to interact with over the last 29 years . and after a while , patterns become obvious .
now , these are not goals or desires , these are universal .
we all want it . most people settle for connection because love &apos;s too scary . don &apos;t want to get hurt .
next year eight . i wasn &apos;t doing it for brownie points , but after eight , i thought , shit , i could use some help .
she was on larry king later , and he said , &quot; you &apos;re probably wondering how on earth this could happen to you twice . &quot; and he said , &quot; all i can say to you is , this must be god &apos;s message to you , honey . from now on , every day give your all , love your all .
so that when it gets dark , i &apos;ve got plenty of power .
all of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day .
montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid .
here we see people that feel &quot; slipping , &quot; &quot; nauseous , &quot; &quot; responsible . &quot;
this is in response to , what &apos;s beautiful ? &quot; miss world . &quot;
this is the universe of 2007 , the last two months .
so if i put in climate change for all of 2006 , we &apos;ll see what that universe looks like .
and i &apos;ve taken the liberty , just for clarity , to translate that to data slices .
she &apos;s playing a computer game .
we &apos;re just pushing the body through the whole ct scanner , and just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set .
one of the things that i &apos;m really , really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table .
and he &apos;s sitting there in front of the haptic device , the force feedback system , and he &apos;s moving his pen towards the heart , and the heart is now beating in front of him , so he can see how the heart is beating .
we can investigate things . we can tell him to do things .
and you might want to cuddle this one , until you change the functions and look at this .
it was rather dull . but i came back to africa at the age of 17 , as a volunteer teacher to lesotho , which is a tiny country , surrounded at that time by apartheid south africa .
well , i &apos;m not going to explain this equation , but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject .
and a tiny distance away , there &apos;s another sheet , also three-dimensional , and they &apos;re separated by a gap .
and gradually , we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world .
my parents were both elected to the first parliament , alongside nelson and winnie mandela . they were the only other couple .
and so when word came out that aims was opening , it spread very quickly via e-mail and our website .
and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green .
he &apos;s about to finish his ph.d. , and he was filmed recently with someone you all know .
we want to roll out 15 aims centers in the next five years , all over africa .
thank you .
that &apos;s how much power this computer uses .
so i &apos;m not the first to figure this out . this is a quote from brian eno : &quot; the problem with computers is that there is not enough africa in them . &quot;
transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen , and technology has really benefitted from that .
they want to compress the information -- they just want to send the changes , what &apos;s new in the image , and so on -- and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve , to send to the rest of the brain .
thank you .
so why is it so important ?
so , there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies .
and it &apos;s a very fragile entity .
in 1827 , a fellow called george pocock actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies in races against horse carriages across the english countryside .
so you ask , how big are those machines ?
it certainly impacted the way we think about ted &apos;s future , and perhaps the world &apos;s future overall .
you turn up the dials , the wheel starts to turn .
so , this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd-accelerated innovation .
this is the technology that &apos;s going to allow the rest of the world &apos;s talents to be shared digitally , thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd-accelerated innovation .
i mean , look : if you can show instead of just describing , that problem goes away .
i mean , today , one person speaking can be seen by millions , shedding bright light on potent ideas , creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- and in his case , intense desire to laugh .
there &apos;s a self-help group .
and hofmann is a polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century , and he &apos;s widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time .
gh : ok , e for effort .
ted is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock , so they &apos;re going to hate me for revealing this , because , actually , you should talk as long as they will let you .
so , now it &apos;s time to put it all together and design the ultimate tedtalk .
more than two thirds of them had college degrees .
&lt; transcript &gt;
politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be .
now , what does this mean for our politics , for our public services , for our government ?
why ? it cuts fuel poverty , it cuts their bills , and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time .
they &apos;re the second largest fish in the world , they &apos;re almost extinct , and we know almost nothing about them . at tedxdublin , simon berrow describes the fascinating basking shark , and the exceptional -- and wonderfully low-tech -- ways he &apos;s learning enough to save them .
and then they &apos;d tow the sharks back to purteen harbor , boil them up , use the oil .
they &apos;re not protected in ireland .
so he did another study using microsatellites , which are much more expensive , much more time consuming , and , to his surprise , came up with almost identical results .
and i remembered -- i used to spend a lot of time out on commercial fishing boats -- i remember fishermen telling me they can always tell when a basking shark &apos;s been caught in the net because it leaves this black slime behind .
and what you &apos;re trying to look at is the males have claspers , which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark .
we are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
i felt like i was performing this elaborate act .
how could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else ?
this is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but i found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns , visual , such as you &apos;re having right now in relation to the stage and me , or auditory images , as you are having now in relation to my words .
on the right side , my retina is perfectly symmetrical .
so for example , i &apos;m making images of you , but there &apos;s no physiological bond between the images i have of you as an audience and my brain .
you cannot have a conscious mind if you don &apos;t have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem .
we should look at how society and culture in this socio-cultural regulation are a work in progress .
but she was not the only feminist in the house .
i co-edit , along with a collective of other super-smart , amazing women , a site called feministing.com .
i went out and i worked at a non-profit , i went to grad school , i phone-banked , i protested , i volunteered , and none of it seemed to matter .
one of them was i used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home , and i would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom &apos;s cold toes with my right hand .
today we &apos;re often too busy tending to our iphones and ipods to really stop and get to know ourselves .
it &apos;s the direct signal being recorded from my head , rendered in real time .
over 17 days at the olympics 7,000 visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the c.n. tower , parliament and niagara in real time with their minds from across the country , 3,000 km away .
i like to call this &quot; intra-active . &quot;
with humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles .
do you know what i wanted to be ?
and when i want to look beautiful , i step three feet away from the mirror , and i don &apos;t have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting i &apos;ve done all my life from all the dark lights .
and i found myself in front of an hr manager in 1999 , saying something i never imagined that i would say .
and as i left his office , he called me back and he said , &quot; i think it &apos;s time .
what did you want to be when you were little ? do you love what you do ?
do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we &apos;re not ?
losing of labels , because we are not jam jars .
the environments we are living in , more typically , are like these .
it wasn &apos;t pei and cobb , another firm designed this , but there &apos;s not enough prozac in the world to make people feel ok about going down this block .
ok . that completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk , where the theoretical pedestrians are .
we know that heather , his sister heather , 14 years old , is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit .
we &apos;re not ready for what &apos;s coming at us .
early on its development , they did a very small trial , just under a hundred patients .
carter emmart demos a 3d atlas of the universe
this is nepal .
and sometimes we just start building .
i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they &apos;d never told anyone before .
we all heard you pee . &quot;
and it might seem like a simple idea , and it is , but the impact it can have on people &apos;s lives can be huge .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and music is very fun , but it &apos;s also transformative .
everybody can experience music in a profound way , we just have to make different tools .
so instead of being grand opera , this opera will turn into what we &apos;re thinking of as personal opera .
you know , what &apos;s his metaphor for performance ?
tm : ok , now dan will play his piece &quot; my eagle song &quot; for you .
so he unties odysseus , and odysseus flips out .
it &apos;s in control . it &apos;s in power right now .
you &apos;re just telling yourself , &quot; without you , commitment device , i am nothing , i have no self-discipline . &quot;
on the one hand , it sounds ridiculous .
so here i made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes , i show people what those outcomes will get you , in particular apartments that you can afford if you &apos;re retiring on 3,000 , 2,500 , 2,000 dollars per month and so on .
we &apos;re going to see if this has an effect on what people do .
this includes the little system in arabic called al-jebra .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and unless we address this invisibility , we are going to get the results that we are seeing , which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset .
we tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth , it &apos;s common goods .
puma has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover , 300 million dollars of profits , 200 million dollars after tax , 94 million dollars of externalities , cost to business .
so in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations , what we have done is we &apos;ve made an ethical choice .
it was always fun to be with him .
i &apos;m trying to remember the words -- &quot; monism , &quot; &quot; dualism , &quot; categories all over the place .
and he wanted to understand what it was and why it was that there was this funny connection .
but no doubt part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could .
the experiments that were going on were very simple .
in this low-key , image-packed talk from 2002 , designer christopher c. deam talks about his makeover of an american classic : the airstream travel trailer .
that &apos;s the trailer , pretty much finished .
&lt; transcript &gt;
from playing with it , they learn some basic principles about fire , about intake , about combustion , about exhaust .
number five -- two-parter .
desperate for a solution , we &apos;ve turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn-out body parts , but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body , shouldn &apos;t we stop and ask if there &apos;s a better , more natural way ?
it &apos;s by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it , and then we can put it back into a patient &apos;s knee .
the astronauts each got to carry about ten silk flags in their personal kits .
it &apos;s designed like an escher print .
all of imagination -- everything that we think , we feel , we sense -- comes through the human brain .
the ball is driven by three special wheels that allow rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time .
so i am one of those people with a transformative personal story .
so it &apos;s a little bit unexpected , but , in a way , it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or they make in school and give to their parents , which is in itself a form of honor .
&quot; you &apos;ve never really been sure of this , but i can assure you that this quirk you &apos;re so self-conscious of is intensely endearing .
and it was the hardest invention i ever made , but it got me started , and i got really lucky after that .
course , like light , it &apos;s great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack , or the cornflakes , or the toothpaste , or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby .
i have been really lucky with this technology : all of a sudden as it is ready , the world is ready to accept it .
because the sound is made in the air along this column , it does not follow the inverse square law , which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance : 6db every time you go from one meter , for instance , to two meters .
so , i &apos;ve been really lucky as an inventor .
so when we think about future technologies , we actually think of using bacteria and virus , simple organisms .
and i was really fortunate to have president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit , and i really wanted to give him a periodic table .
so one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube .
and i brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward .
i was at work .
why do we expect people to work well if they &apos;re being interrupted all day at the office ?
it doesn &apos;t work that way .
the first thursday of the month -- just the afternoon -- nobody in the office can talk to each other .
we live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people .
ok , it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask .
and it &apos;s , quite simply , the point of reflection .
and the fact is that millions of people do it .
and , yes , there are things like grameen bank and micro-lending .
and i look at something like this and it makes me question , if we were to take all the functionality in things like this , and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network , how would we prioritize where to put stuff ?
the next thing is that , however we design this stuff -- carefully design this stuff -- the street will take it , and will figure out ways to innovate , as long as it meets base needs -- the ability to transcend space and time , for example .
you can find this on youtube , the gentleman who &apos;s recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging .
this was figured out by robin williams a few years before the rest of us .
well , our genes are not our fate , and if we make these changes -- they &apos;re a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise , we can actually change how our genes are expressed .
but i had always felt like , look , you know , i made the best choice i could make given who i was then , given the information i had on hand .
you &apos;re going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by 20 .
but for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around , what does that experience feel like ?
it &apos;s that i sat there and i thought , &quot; make it go away . make it go away .
and this doesn &apos;t even touch on the really profound regrets of a life .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;m a perfectionist .
accepting the 2007 ted prize , bill clinton asks for help in bringing health care to rwanda -- and the rest of the world .
half of them gave over the internet .
we negotiated it down to 190 .
because the longer i deal with these problems , the more convinced i am that we have to -- whether it &apos;s economics , health , education , whatever -- we have to build systems .
she was ceo of a successful e-venture -- she started and built reed elsevier ventures -- and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life .
we &apos;re now working with partners in health and the ministry of health in rwanda and our foundation folks to scale this system up .
i had a really hard time in school .
would he have had more possibilities in his life ?
the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months .
they took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen , sliced them thinly and made delicious chips .
local means that 20 percent of the population of the school has to be balinese , and this was a really big commitment .
it was chaos .
for several days now , we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at ted .
there was no particular day when anyone told me i would never speak again ; it just sort of became obvious .
so chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my tv show voice from a period of 30 years .
i have typed these words in advance , as i didn &apos;t think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing .
in cosmological terms , that was about 10 minutes ago .
does anybody remember that ? &quot;
when you see me today , i look like the phantom of the opera .
if i were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago , i would be as isolated as a hermit .
and we &apos;d rather read it during breakfast , because later we listen to radio in a car , check your mail at work and in the evening you watch tv .
soon it started to bring results .
i took an architectural rule about function and form and translated it into newspaper content and design .
&lt; transcript &gt;
she ended up underneath the car .
everybody lost faith in me being able to recover .
so while sally , the office manager , was teaching me to speak in the day -- it &apos;s hard , because when you &apos;re a kid , you take things for granted .
the biggest change for me was that the world moved forward , that there were innovations and all kinds of new things -- cellphones , laptops , all these things that i had never seen before .
and this is when it really gets interesting .
thomas edison would have been very , very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today .
a number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it .
so this was the best job he could get .
the photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there .
so you &apos;ve effectively negated 60 years of aeronautic research .
and we &apos;ve rendered something illegible , and we &apos;ve lost the sense of what &apos;s actually happening in this world that we &apos;ve made .
so one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for 60 percent of those movies .
and you see why . you see why .
unfortunately , we have our work cut out for us .
and energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle -- it &apos;s also about the road .
discount that back to the present , at five percent : over two million dollars for a stop sign , in each direction .
and you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle . thank you very much .
and i think that &apos;s doable in well under 20 years .
now , malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitoes .
now let me turn to a second question , a fairly different question , but i &apos;d say equally important .
for minority kids , it &apos;s over 50 percent .
this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality .
i thought , &quot; i &apos;m in the sports rally or something .
if you have a kid who &apos;s behind , you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept .
and in many ways , it always has been .
that &apos;s what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient &apos;s on the table .
and the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors -- for example , the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make .
it doesn &apos;t tell you whether or not the gas station has gas .
people said , &quot; we &apos;ve been doing it this way for all these years .
we received commentary in discover magazine , in the economist .
think about your day for a second .
this elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance .
because if you could find those , those would be some of the signals that could drive learning .
so this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light , and we beam light in , and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure , we &apos;re hoping to be able to turn it off .
now mice are smart , so this mouse solves the maze eventually , but he does a brute-force search .
&lt; transcript &gt;
it has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth , our spit .
because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density , of largely urban density , of connecting people and putting them together in one place , and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together .
the whole system kind of working on it , and everybody contributing a small little part .
there &apos;s a problem with the google zeitgeist , which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for britney spears pictures , which is not necessarily news .
and so the question is , &quot; why is this happening ? &quot;
but , you know , we &apos;ve just come from this discussion of what a bird might be .
if the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the clean air act , then i see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as , &quot; brain death for all children . no child left behind . &quot;
a fundamental issue that &apos;s not being addressed .
if we look at the world of architecture , we see with mies &apos; 1928 tower for berlin , the question might be , &quot; well , where &apos;s the sun ? &quot;
we &apos;re adding the jeffersonian agenda , and i come from charlottesville , where i &apos;ve had the privilege of living in a house designed by thomas jefferson .
using those intellectual filters , we eliminated &#91; 7,962 . &#93; we were left with 38 chemicals .
and we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the internet .
the transportation is all very simple , everybody &apos;s within a five-minute walk of mobility .
so for example , they can see in the back part of the brain , which is just turning around there .
these are support cells -- astrocytes glia .
because what we &apos;re trying to measure , the rna -- which is the readout from our genes -- is very labile , and so we have to move very quickly .
you can see on the microscope slide here , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in real time .
so drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off , etc .
this is an example of a study that we did to follow up and see what exactly those differences were -- and they &apos;re quite subtle .
and i suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well , but somehow it doesn &apos;t happen with the same intensity .
we already know how to kill malaria , but some people come to you and say , &quot; you have your millions . how about bed nets ? &quot;
the same child that is not immunized against measles , if they do get measles , parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them .
the second one is : if i give bed nets for free , are people going to use them ?
there &apos;s no silver bullet .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
it was from rosabeth moss kanter , harvard business school guru and a professor of mine .
and i see the same picture , but from the opposite side .
nigeria : a similar situation , from the 16 percent to the eight percent . single digits .
the new report , &quot; the next eleven , &quot; highlights that by 2020 nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world .
so they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse across the industries -- away from oil .
but in any investment decision , the key question is , &quot; what is my alternative investment ? &quot;
that is a transformation in power of ideas .
brain magic . what &apos;s brain magic all about ?
keith barry : kathryn , it &apos;s keith here . i &apos;m going to take you to a secret location , ok ?
kt : no , no , no , no .
but if i wanted you to look at my right hand , then i look at it , too . you see , it &apos;s very , very simple , once you know how , but very complicated in other ways .
kb : things that go bump in the night ?
yeah , i walk around nightclubs all night like this .
ok , let &apos;s try it again .
come right over here , next to me .
see the way i knew that , because my name starts with a k also , but his name doesn &apos;t start with a k , it starts with an m .
ok , and tell me when you &apos;re done .
kb : ok , where are you ? put out your hand .
kb : good decision .
we &apos;re the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments .
turns out it wasn &apos;t so easy .
you only do it one time .
so along with colleagues in zurich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo , had that same trust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust , we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger -- all without altering mood or cognition .
but he was , in fact , a moral philosopher , and he was right on why we &apos;re moral .
so this is a classic con called the pigeon drop , and i was the pigeon .
so i &apos;ve gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives .
and they had the reporters and their producers participate .
&lt; transcript &gt;
it was three feet off the ground , and they said , &quot; what is this ? &quot;
but i was curious to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ?
what &apos;s the next page ? gosh , when i was your age , i could have never done that . &apos; you know what grannies do . &quot;
if you didn &apos;t , you failed .
they are basically broadband , collaboration and encouragement put together .
if you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then i &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the school of clouds , and create the future of learning .
evelyn glennie shows how to listen
and you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick , even though i &apos;m actually holding the stick quite tightly .
but yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
very good ! snow . snow . have you ever heard snow ?
is it just literally for control , for hand-stick control ? why am i doing that ?
and that &apos;s led to this discussion that &apos;s completely raw , completely unfiltered .
anonymous is this group of people that protested , very famously , scientology .
but -- tell me about what -- i mean , i think you asked the board what you might say at ted , right ?
sixty-five million years ago , a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land .
some of them -- the most important -- are mental .
we had to find and measure the largest crocodiles living today .
and you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem .
running -- it &apos;s basically just right , left , right , left -- yeah ?
the tarahumara had a different strategy .
the third mystery is this : at the university of utah , they started tracking finishing times for people running the marathon .
the pack has got to be able to swallow its ego , be cooperative and pull together .
cynthia breazeal : the rise of personal robots
he &apos;s a psychologist we &apos;ve been collaborating with .
i like to think of this as the atari pong of this blended-reality play .
i was fascinated by this phenomenon , so i wondered : could one erase the image of diana , actually quite crudely and physically ?
in england there &apos;s an expression : &quot; you can &apos;t imagine the queen on the loo . &quot;
then i made a book .
i then was asked by selfridges to do a series of windows for them , so i built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes -- live scenes with look-alikes inside the windows , and the windows were all steamed up .
that &apos;s why this image was made one year ago , and what it means today .
it &apos;s that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world .
and the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols , and i just couldn &apos;t tell .
there &apos;s no comparison at all .
easy to treat . look at the situation in mauritius .
additionally , we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay .
i can call you in switzerland and say , &quot; listen , go into our system .
people say , &quot; how can you do that ? &quot; this is how we can do that .
autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe -- the child remains non-verbal -- all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers .
and i was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different . like if i say , &quot; think about a church steeple &quot; most people get this sort of generalized generic one .
and where i was bad was algebra . and i was never allowed to take geometry or trig .
a man on foot -- they &apos;re two different things .
the thing is , you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind , or your mind can be wired to be more social .
he was a nasa space scientist .
it &apos;s libraries .
ah , sorry about that .
and this brings up the question , what made them think they could get away with something like that ?
the only programmers who can change it are people who &apos;ve specifically been given permission to access it , and they &apos;re only allowed to access the sub-section of it that they have permission to change .
this long string of numbers and letters here is a unique identifier tied to every single change , but without any central coordination .
you can go and pick your senator and then you can see a list of bills they have sponsored .
thank you . thank you .
i &apos;m morgan hendry . i am nasa .
now , if there is life , the dutch will find it .
so i thought i would go a little bit and tell you , kind of , the steps we go through .
so people believe now that titan is most likely what we call a pre-biotic planet , because it &apos;s so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material , and therefore life could have evolved on it .
we often think linearly .
but where i think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging .
here in the netherlands , i think it &apos;s more than 80 percent .
i can share that with my friends , with my physician .
still in clinical trials , but imagine when we can connect these , for example , to the amazing bionic limb , such as the deka arm built by dean kamen and colleagues , which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who &apos;s lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they &apos;ve had in the past .
or for those of us who are sighted , how about having the assisted-living contact lens ?
geomedicine : where you &apos;ve lived , what you &apos;ve been exposed to , can dramatically affect your health .
we also have adult stem cells throughout our body .
thank you . thank you .
this is called &quot; the dress . &quot;
sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds , so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before it drifted away .
her occupancy , her absolute , faithful attendance .
always that erotic murmur , i &apos;m hardly myself if i &apos;m not in a state of incipient desire .
what i mean is the world holds me so tightly -- the good and the bad -- my own follies and weakness that even this counterfeit venus with her sham heat , and her bosom probably plumped with gel , so moves me my breath catches .
this destructive power takes many different forms .
images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other .
more than 2,000 people have climbed everest .
there &apos;s a wire dangling down either side .
we got to khatanga .
i knew there was more open water . and i had a secret weapon up my sleeve .
the entire planet is rotating beneath my feet .
i mean , it really was starting to break up .
in this short talk , psychologist dan ariely tells two personal stories that explore scientific conflict of interest : how the pursuit of knowledge and insight can be affected , consciously or not , by shortsighted personal goals . when we &apos;re thinking about the big questions , he reminds us , let &apos;s be aware of our all-too-human brains .
so we had one group that i hoped their performance would be very high , another group that i thought their performance would be very low , and when i got the results , that &apos;s what we got -- i was very happy -- aside from one person .
imagine you &apos;re a shipwrecked sailor adrift in the enormous pacific . you can choose one of three directions and save yourself and your shipmates -- but each choice comes with a fearful consequence too . how do you choose ? in telling the story of the whaleship essex , novelist karen thompson walker shows how fear propels imagination , as it forces us to imagine the possible futures and how to cope with them .
the same incredible imaginations that produced &quot; the origin of species , &quot; &quot; jane eyre &quot; and &quot; the remembrance of things past , &quot; also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of charles darwin , charlotte brontăť and marcel proust .
in other words , our fears make us think about the future .
but , &quot; as melville put it , &quot; they dreaded cannibals . &quot;
people do get hiv because they do stupid things , but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons .
one in four , maximum .
so it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors .
what &apos;s rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it &apos;s really bad for business to have another sti .
you see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program .
from the point of view of a public health nerd , junkies are doing dumb things .
this is why they did not accept .
and this is how the revolution was born in tunisia .
and then when they failed , they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from tel aviv and washington in order to divide the arab world .
the stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction .
wk : i think we have discovered a very important issue in the arab world -- that people care , people care about this great transformation .
well , my true love &apos;s a black-eyed daisy ; if i don &apos;t see her , i go crazy .
thank you , michael .
now , the old timers didn &apos;t take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this .
of course , we were just eight and 10 .
no , we learned something else .
and i don &apos;t want it to leave me behind .
and you know , at the top of the list , of course , were jenny , and my son , zeb , my parents -- i didn &apos;t want to hurt them .
we moved to california when sputnik went up , in 1957 .
they said , we &apos;re going to melt it down and make rocket fuel .
&lt; transcript &gt;
i had spent my first sabbatical in new york city .
then this is a fairly talkative , verbose kind of chair .
sending mail to japanese design magazines and things like that .
it works the same internally with the president or the musical director , whose casa da musica portraits wind up on their business cards .
we used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece .
stefan sagmeister : thank you .
and being in this process of being in a community that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions , i believe , teaches us about democracy .
and in this universe there &apos;s nothing fixed and absolute . zilch , ok .
darwin wouldn &apos;t make sense in an aristotelian universe , and wouldn &apos;t really make sense in a newtonian universe .
chris has been so nice .
and now it &apos;s an idea .
uh , no . &quot;
asking for your bank details .
you like that one ? as opposed to you could see george bush , well , what &apos;s the metaphor there ?
so he comes over to this country , and he says , &quot; we need a big fiscal stimulus . &quot;
or , any south africans , we have mandela to inspire .
now i assume that we remember dinosaurs .
dr. peter dodson at the university of pennsylvania that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do , which is different than the way reptiles grow .
so that &apos;s what i do .
nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike .
so a colleague of mine at berkley , he and i were looking at triceratops .
but it &apos;s got these big holes in its shield .
so it must be true -- they must be different . &quot;
the thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space .
and we pride ourselves -- it &apos;s a spectacular anti-spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head .
and our work doesn &apos;t really resolve itself into a body in any way at all .
moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago .
but we &apos;re doing it with a lot less testosterone .
so it &apos;s a very , very thin architecture .
the three plants are areca palm , mother-in-law &apos;s tongue and money plant .
and there is a growing preference for living and working in air-conditioned places .
pm : so is this a good idea .
and therefore it means that we have to remember that , while many of us have had huge opportunities -- and pat , you have been a real leader in your field -- is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women .
but it doesn &apos;t mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women .
and so i think what needs to happen is we need to help each other .
so exit the rock star .
and if you live on less than $ 1.25 a day , if you live in that kind of poverty , this is not just data .
you can tell politicians that these cuts &#91; can cost &#93; lives .
might we answer that clarion call with science , with reason , with facts , and , dare i say it , emotions ?
so now , all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology , and it shows the power of molecular programs -- biology does .
and i &apos;m going to draw it like this sometimes , just so i don &apos;t scare you .
so , this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes , ok ?
but if we use a little computation -- we use origami , plus some tiles that count -- then we can get away with using 100 , 200 or 300 dna strands .
i built , along with my two brothers , the leading real estate company in my home state , kerala , and then worked professionally with two of india &apos;s biggest businessmen , but in their startup enterprises .
and the demand side being mostly politicians , bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them .
it can be worth up to one trillion dollars , being paid in bribes every year , or equal to india &apos;s gdp .
a set of people actually say , &quot; oh , let me just grant it to them , and run away from it . &quot;
and he appealed to virtue .
a wise person knows how to improvise , as luke did when he re-washed the floor .
all they had was mike &apos;s hard lemonade , which was five percent alcohol .
regulate , regulate , regulate .
jazz musicians need some notes -- most of them need some notes on the page .
what happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking , &quot; what is my responsibility ? &quot;
be proud that you have them .
ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too .
and i think he was right .
and i was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy , paperwork and dods .
there &apos;s randy , these guys are passing a rubber little puck between them .
we &apos;re screaming along .
those are political questions , economic questions , strategic questions .
and great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
next assumption -- and of course the events of july 7 , i express my deep sympathy , and before that , september 11 -- have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds .
who would have imagined that germany would be either united or democratic today , if you looked at it from the perspective of oxford of 1943 ?
the world in which i operate operates with designs regarding roads , or dams , or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in 60 years .
we were bombed practically out of existence .
and that woman said she didn &apos;t care whether she had food on her table .
the aid system does not have the knowledge , the vision , the ability .
my american colleagues have told me i &apos;ve got to call it a router , so that everyone here understands — — but nonetheless , here is the device .
oh , there we are . we can save it now .
there &apos;s two degrees , or three degrees of climate change baked into the system .
we are facing an unprecedented number , scale of disasters .
this is the difficulty that one country faces .
all throughout the technology world , we &apos;re seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome .
my background is not exactly conventional medical training .
benoit mandelbrot : fractals and the art of roughness
they were done on a computer , and the only input is a number , and that number is roughness .
this cloud is completely , 100 percent artificial .
but painting for a long time had a fractal side .
to the left you see data over a long period .
if you could find something new , anything , you will get your career made . &quot;
bottomless wonders spring from simple rules , which are repeated without end .
this is a cama .
some of you may have read about the fda &apos;s consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon .
they &apos;ve created a kind of insect bot , it gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that .
and he used that as the it piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator .
it confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now .
so he had traveled all around .
uvb turns out to be incredibly important .
lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once , not just twice , but probably three times .
so how can we overcome this ?
spread the word .
why ? because it makes a lot of sense .
so , if you think about it , in this particular puzzle task , it could happen in investing in the stock market , very volatile out there , it could be the medical situation -- the feedback here is immediate .
after all , happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few , but a fundamental human right for all .
well , we don &apos;t need , now , any more nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money , just like everyone else .
and this leads to very high handling costs .
nearly three years ago , i decided to leave my comfortable job as a world bank senior economist in washington and come back to my country of birth , ethiopia , after nearly 30 years abroad .
the ecx edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself .
ecx is the market for ethiopia &apos;s new millennium , which starts in about eight months .
it is peaceful and violent .
that &apos;s a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously .
i learned about this from a professor at u.c. davis called jason dejong .
it &apos;s not only something that supports trees , but something that connects people and countries together .
i needed tools that were robust , modular , highly efficient and optimized , made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime , not designed for obsolescence .
i started out in chesapeake bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight .
and that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not-so-tasty species , from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world , and what have you .
it was accidentally released from the aquarium in monaco , it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria .
this is from the coast of brittany , which is being enveloped in this green , algal slime .
and the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this , is do we know how to put humpty dumpty back together again ?
in the summer of 1950 , enrico fermi , the italian-american physicist and atomic-pile builder , went to lunch at los alamos national laboratory and joined some colleagues there , and asked them a question : &quot; where is everybody ? &quot;
this was the summer when the special edition of &quot; close encounters of the third kind &quot; was released .
&quot; kew , kew , kew -- watch out . &quot;
i sure am glad i never saw her again .
a tan , we were both tan -- is this true ?
and even though , i think you &apos;ll agree , it is probable that during the time she was away , she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone , i love her and wait for her still .
how much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets ?
but the materiality matters too , because in every society that anthropologists have looked at , material stuff operates as a kind of language -- a language of goods , a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories -- stories , for example , about how important we are .
they want to spend less and save more .
that is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives , and it &apos;s a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model .
and ecosia works in pretty much the same way .
it &apos;s clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty .
tj : it has to be companies . it has to be civil society .
you &apos;ve probably heard of benzene rings ; they &apos;re very carcinogenic .
you might notice that many gas pumps , including this one , are designed to look like atms .
but in the beginning , this was seen as a very morally problematic thing , long before it became funny .
i think it &apos;s important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us .
we pay for it in our taxes on april 15th .
we need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel .
we need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater , not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there .
because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group .
so for me , the substance of things unseen is how reality tv is driving reality .
i put on my ipod , i listened to some music , i got myself as aggressive as possible -- but controlled aggression -- and then i hurled myself into that water .
inventor and macarthur fellow saul griffith shares some innovative ideas from his lab -- from &quot; smart rope &quot; to a house-sized kite for towing large loads .
so this is interesting in the sense that you can now do &quot; if-then-for &quot; statements in materials , in structure .
so , that &apos;s about three light switches lined up .
having totally absorbed this philosophy , i started looking at a lot of problems a little differently .
just by thinking about the physics of the world , materials as the computer , you can start to do things like this .
this is a kite designed by a guy called dave kulp .
i won &apos;t show you very many graphs today , but if i can just focus on this one for a moment , it really tells us a lot of what we need to know -- which is , quite simply , that if you look , for example , at transportation , a major category of climate emissions , there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air .
this is google walking maps .
this is vancouver &apos;s propaganda about how green a city they are .
now , in the decade of darfur and iraq , a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene . but i &apos;m going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture . the decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon . you can see it over millennia , over centuries , over decades and over years , although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the age of reason in the sixteenth century . one sees it all over the world , although not homogeneously .
president clinton , if you &apos;re here , thank you .
the fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called &quot; the expanding circle , &quot; by the philosopher peter singer , who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy , an ability to treat other peoples &apos; interests as comparable to one &apos;s own . unfortunately , by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family .
this might not sound like a large number , but in a country with 76 million people , it means there are 930,000 that are infected .
it &apos;s people back home , people that support their work , people like these .
and here , length of life , life expectancy , 30 , 40 , 50 .
but if i would change this axis here , i would instead put income per person .
whereas when my oldest son , who works for google , he should develop by quarter , or by half-year .
and this is how the world changed .
east europe , latin america , and oecd countries .
and what has happened in the world ?
and third chance for sweden , against brazil here .
about 20 percent of the adult population are infected .
it &apos;s similar to the pellagra epidemic in mississippi in the &apos; 30s .
author robert wright explains &quot; non-zero-sumness &quot; -- the network of linked fortunes and cooperation that has guided our evolution to this point -- and how we can use it to help save humanity today .
this may not seem to impress , but technological evolution is progressive , so another 10 , 20,000 years , and armaments technology takes you here .
like , have you ever thought when you buy a car , how many people on how many different continents contributed to the manufacture of that car ? those are people in effect you &apos;re playing a non-zero-sum game with .
and that &apos;s pretty new , and i think it &apos;s probably going to get a lot worse -- this capacity -- because of trends in information technology , in technologies that can be used for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology .
i mean , what do you do ?
if you look at the word &quot; salvation &quot; in the bible -- the christian usage that we &apos;re familiar with -- saving souls , that people go to heaven -- that &apos;s actually a latecomer .
we &apos;d better give you a real sound bite .
we forgot about improving normal lives .
and we find that we &apos;ve been able to manualize many of them , and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies .
and the reason he was , was that len is a cold fish .
her highest strength was social intelligence , so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer &apos;s day .
another example is a strength date , in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test , and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths , and we find this is a strengthener of relationships .
we also know that technology , entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery .
pygmies in the drc , by randy olson .
now i have to tell you , i was talking to kyle last week about this , that i was going to tell this story .
here &apos;s a photograph shot in moonlight , something that digital photography has made a big difference for .
by staying tightly focused in one place , jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community .
but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are , when it comes down to it , just plain fun .
i believe that photography can make a real connection to people , and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today .
and , even more importantly , since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture , we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon , in many different facial poses and facial expressions .
and there is the underlying wireframe mesh .
and i said , &quot; no way , i &apos;m not doing it .
so soldier was fleeing in the okapi faunal reserve .
and fortunately , i saved his life .
we have to do it , because to let our movement advance . &quot;
this is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this .
thank you .
otherwise it is completely dark in these places .
it has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice .
depthx is an all-seeing eyeball .
thus , every time you &apos;d want to do anything in space , you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator .
the traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency .
&lt; transcript &gt;
also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma .
it &apos;s a kind of cosmology , and i have to develop a cosmology of my own universe , as the creator of that universe .
and that means because we went into iraq , we should stay there until things were solved . you know , maybe even 100 years .
you think there &apos;s a sort of coincidence going on , a serendipity , in which you &apos;re getting all this help from the universe .
and my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother .
and as i said , my mother did not believe in randomness .
i believe in specifics , the specifics of story , and the past , the specifics of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point .
like the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something .
but the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child .
cows are invisible . cows are boring .
he lived in paris . last year he sold 10 million dollars &apos; worth of french bread .
not because it &apos;s hard to make interesting mustard -- you can make interesting mustard -- but people don &apos;t because no one &apos;s obsessed with it , and thus no one tells their friends .
they &apos;re made from &quot; cremains . &quot;
this is a map of soap lake , washington .
so i &apos;ll be sharing some of these noes with you .
i would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for national geographic magazine .
in reality , these animals have no terrestrial counterpart ; they &apos;re unique in the world .
but this is an animal that &apos;s considered data deficient by science in both florida and in the bahamas .
the north atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales ; they live along the east coast of north america , united states and canada , and they have to deal with all these urban ills .
every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy , from tiny , little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting sponge or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold .
as wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class .
and those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat , the largest accumulation of organic material in the world .
so we do the &quot; people , profit , planet &quot; principles , but we do it in addition to a sure legal status -- because if the forest belongs to the state , people say , &quot; it belongs to me , it belongs to everyone . &quot;
this is what it looked like for three months .
that you can go from this zero situation , by planting the vegetables and the trees , or directly , the trees in the lines in that grass there , putting up the buffer zone , producing your compost , and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used .
and look , there &apos;s now 11.2 percent more clouds -- already , after three years .

oaxaca , san francisco -- it &apos;s very easy : market street , van ness and the waterfront .
and it &apos;s not shanghai , it &apos;s not being colored during the day , only at night it will look this way .
if you cut two zeros , it &apos;s much better .
and i referenced that at the end of my last talk .
reform is no use anymore , because that &apos;s simply improving a broken model .
&quot; like , how lame is that ? &quot;
there are many great models .
and my mother came up and said , &quot; what on earth are you doing ? &quot;
that means i need to know how i tick , when i collapse , where my formidable points are , where my weaker points are .
so that &apos;s fear . what about anger ?
up to now their counter-terrorism policy has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost , and if civilians get in the way , that &apos;s written as &quot; collateral damage . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to believe in it .
they went on to describe me as america &apos;s greenest ceo .
and that became the interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since .
a better business model , a better way to bigger profits .
but does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?
knowing you has changed my thinking .
gen-y &apos;ers spent even more -- 23.8 hours , the majority online .
but the number of arts participants , people who write poetry , who sing songs , who perform in church choirs , is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations .
what an exciting and inspiring event .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m bill strickland . i want you to teach me that . &quot;
as you can see , it has a fountain in the courtyard .
what you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life .
that good food &apos;s not for rich people -- good food &apos;s for everybody on the planet , and there &apos;s no excuse why we all can &apos;t be eating it .
i can take these children and in 20 weeks , demonstrated aptitude ; i can get them high school equivalent .
we have smoked salmon at the art openings , we have a formal printed invitation , and i even have figured out a way to get their parents to come .
my only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old . &quot;
and i &apos;m very pleased to tell you that , with their permission , i have now accumulated 600 recordings of the greatest artists in the world , including joe williams , who died , but not before his last recording was done at my school .
and i think we &apos;re going to be fine .
i appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody &apos;s expectations and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year , and said , &quot; mr. strickland , you ought to get the civic leader of the year award because you &apos;ve appreciated our property values beyond our wildest expectations .
and along the way , i met this real short guy at my slide show in the silicon valley .
but i met a guy named quincy jones along the way and i showed him the box of slides .
and i believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration and one of hope .
so a completely blind retina , even one with no front-end circuitry at all , no photoreceptors , can now send out normal signals , signals that the brain can understand .
there is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do , but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life .
but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously .
these are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells .
each bacteria uses a particular molecule that &apos;s its language that allows it to count its own siblings .
they either pop the bacterial membrane , they make the bacterium so it can &apos;t replicate its dna .
by using these two molecules they can say &quot; me &quot; and they can say &quot; you . &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
all right .
what &apos;s your name ?
now , notice , something interesting -- well , i should tell you about the supreme court first .
that illustrates that with golf , as with flutes , it &apos;s hard to decide the question of what justice requires , without grappling with the question , &quot; what is the essential nature of the activity in question , and what qualities , what excellences connected with that activity , are worthy of honor and recognition ? &quot;
michael sandel . thank you so much .
and although i want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that -- and also there &apos;s a factor of luck and timing -- we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values .
so i guess the world is insane , because i see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again , hoping that this time it &apos;s not going to collapse upon us .
ngozi okonjo-iweala on aid versus trade
like in every other country where this has been done , jobs is the top issue .
we were on the biafran side .
and by the same token -- as someone said yesterday -- if we don &apos;t and they die , their children will become a burden on the economy .
and each one is making their own individual effort .
but i &apos;m saying it &apos;s not either or .
i &apos;ve done most of this work at johns hopkins university , but also at the national institute of health where i was previously .
and so all of us have this remarkable brain , which is poorly understood to say the least .
so what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard ?
and we think , at least in this preliminary -- it &apos;s one study ; it &apos;s probably wrong , but it &apos;s one study -- we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that , to be creative , you have to have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe .
when he was trading fours with me , improvising versus memorized , his language areas lit up , his broca &apos;s area , which is inferior frontal gyrus on the left .
go ahead and hit that right sound icon .
arthur benjamin &apos;s formula for changing math education
tan le &apos;s astonishing new computer interface reads its user &apos;s brainwaves , making it possible to control virtual objects , and even physical electronics , with mere thoughts . she demos the headset , and talks about its far-reaching applications .
so with that , i &apos;d like to invite onstage evan grant , who is one of last year &apos;s speakers , who &apos;s kindly agreed to help me to demonstrate what we &apos;ve been able to develop .
so once we accept this , the cube is live .
and also , colors , lighting , sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you &apos;re having , in real time .
almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures .
a vaccine would be a terrific thing , only they don &apos;t work yet .
we also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria : a way , in acute cases , to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system .
we also try to study our foe .
you could , if you &apos;re really smart , you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it , and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size .
this is one of the first ones we did .
floor : sustainable , recyclable .
now it &apos;s important to understand that this room is cooled by water , heated by water , filters its own water , and it &apos;s powered by water .
when i turn 40 , i &apos;ll have a one-hour video that includes just my 30s .
personally , i &apos;m tired of forgetting , and this is a really easy thing to do .
so ham smith and clyde hutchison developed some new methods for making error-free dna at a small level .
and we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them .
so in the remaining information , in the watermarks , contain the names of , i think it &apos;s 46 different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage .
i think this latest oil spill in the gulf we can &apos;t see co2 -- we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it -- but we can see pre-co2 now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the gulf .
so one-third of it reprises the stories of biblical figures like abraham , moses , joseph , mary , jesus .
the word used four times is houris , rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts , or as fair , high-bosomed virgins .
the queen just lays the eggs . there &apos;s no management .
and these four groups are just the ants outside the nest .
the nest maintenance workers become foragers .
something that they &apos;re doing is clearly successful enough that this pattern of haphazard contacts , in the aggregate , produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants .
if you need more resource , you just apply more computer .
laser micro-machining : essentially 3d printers that digitally fabricate functional systems , all the way up to building buildings , not by having blueprints , but having the parts code for the structure of the building .
ken olsen famously said , nobody needs a computer in the home .
and i &apos;ve shown this to engineers at big companies , and they say they can &apos;t do this . any one thing she &apos;s doing , they can do better , but it &apos;s distributed over many people and many sites and they can &apos;t do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural ghana is doing .
the person who runs it nicely describes it as &quot; machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses : &quot; it &apos;s a cross between micro-finance and vc to do fan-out , and then the research partnerships back at mit for what &apos;s making it possible .
you &apos;re probably thinking that was my birth year .
are we smarter than anybody else ? i &apos;m not sure .
it &apos;s what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil . &quot;
you take eight million trucks -- these are 18-wheelers -- and take them to natural gas , reduce carbon by 30 percent , it is cheaper and it will cut our imports three million barrels .
so what happened was that , through increased ability to use fracking technology , the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded and the price plummeted , which made wind uncompetitive .
you all do .
fracking came out in &apos; 47 , and don &apos;t believe for a minute when our president gets up there and says the department of energy 30 years ago developed fracking .
tbp : i lost 150 million on the wind , okay .
sixty-eight rich men on the steamer portland . stacks of yellow metal .
the fort in san francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers .
with the electric industry you actually have to -- one of them is that they &apos;re both sort of thin , horizontal , enabling layers that go across lots of different industries .
this is the electric tie press , which never really did catch on .
and there was no off switch , so it wasn &apos;t very good .
we &apos;re in 1908 .
but i &apos;m also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature , you realize that just affirming compassion , and affirming the golden rule , is really not enough .
that &apos;s just human nature .
so , it &apos;s these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world &apos;s trouble .
it &apos;s going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them .
for example , probably a lot of american christians don &apos;t think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship with muslims halfway around the world , but they really are , because if these muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it , that &apos;s good for americans , because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten american security .
and , similarly , the person in iran : when you try to humanize somebody in america who said that islam is evil , they &apos;ll have trouble with that .
well , this is what deep time does to a building .
based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that danny hillis developed , so that a peal of 10 bells makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years .
and we &apos;re a non-profit foundation , you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction .
and from where you &apos;re standing at 6,000 feet in the valley , it &apos;s an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet .
one is the experience of the mountain .
but i do that all the time .
whether they &apos;re kind of glorified in this way , or whether they &apos;re kind of , you know , ironically glorified , or whether they &apos;re , you know , sort of denigrated , or ironically denigrated .
you know , homosexuality , right ?
i &apos;d been very ingrained in the dance world since i was a teenager .
because it &apos;s all of these things that i love all kind of in one place .
and there &apos;s got to be some way to do that , rosie .
then how could you serve , you know , a beat up old dress or something .
im : you know what ? stop laughing . it &apos;s not funny .
have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around ?
at the age of 19 , i was on the national leadership of this organization in the u.k .
and so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream .
one of their leaders was killed in pakistan recently .
and what happens as a result of this is , when those parties are elected , and inevitably they fail , or inevitably they make political mistakes , democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes .
without human rights , you don &apos;t have the protection granted to you to campaign .

camp one , 2,000 feet higher .
these are climbers moving up the lhotse face , that mountain toward camp three .
the summit would be in the foreground .
rob hall , we heard by radio , was up here , at this point in the storm with doug hansen .
so , as the climbers came by me , i sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down .
this is some severe frostbite on the feet , severe frostbite on the nose .
and i can only try to speculate on how he did it .
okay . this is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it &apos;s actually going to be a motivating factor .
these sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags , the message will be carried up to the gods , and that year , beck &apos;s message was answered .
we talk of people as human capital .
today we live in a country which sells eight million mobile phones a month , of which 90 percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people don &apos;t have credit history .
but having said that , there is an enormous desire among everybody , including the poor , to educate their children .
and it leads to reservations and other techniques .
and then again , india does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty , because it has to marry environment and development .
filmmaker deborah scranton talks about and shows clips from her documentary the war tapes , which puts cameras in the hands of soldiers fighting in iraq .
i started with the 1607 massachusetts bay colony pequot indian wars .
mm : they &apos;re shooting at me .
and really -- because maybe we &apos;re going to disagree .
hey , get over the fucking -- yeah , yeah .
news anchor : more violence in iraq .
so you get to experience that in real time , right ?
or you know , these things .
you know , obviously , like dean kamen &apos;s working on that amazing thing , but there &apos;s charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers .
and of course it &apos;s growing so fast , sometimes there &apos;s growing pains .
he goes , &quot; i don &apos;t care where you were . you just stay where you are , please . just stay where you are . &quot;
for example , i don &apos;t know if you heard about this , a little while ago in the u.s. there was a muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane talking about the safest place to sit on the plane .
so it was a big idea . we wanted to reduce that by 80 percent , which is exactly what we &apos;ve done .
we must change everything .
it is made out of silicon .
it wasn &apos;t until the invention of the mr and really the integration of mr with focused ultrasound that we could get the feedback -- both the anatomical and the physiological in order to have a completely noninvasive , closed-loop surgical procedure .
we first need to verify that we are on target .
he returned to a normal life routine .
he rides his tractor .
this is frances .
that &apos;s one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products .
but even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects , can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend .
are nike t-shirts that are almost identical to one another .
is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society ?
what you &apos;re looking at now is a tree called jomon sugi , living on the remote island of yakushima .
this is a brain coral living in tobago that &apos;s around 2,000 years old .
so as you can see , it &apos;s in a churchyard ; it &apos;s in scotland . it &apos;s behind a protective wall .
these also tend to grow clonally , the oldest of which is 13,000 years old .
videos on the web should work like the web itself : dynamic , full of links , maps and information that can be edited and updated live , says mozilla foundation coo ryan merkley . on the ted stage he demos popcorn maker , a new web-based tool for easy video remixing .
they talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning .
and these big tears fell down her face , but she never lifted her hands to move them .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions , easy categories , because we don &apos;t see profit as a blunt instrument .
and he said that every day this six-year-old , dressed in her beautiful dress , would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily , calling her a monster , threatening to poison her -- distorted faces .
he drew people , anatomy , plants , animals , landscapes , buildings , water , everything .
the young man should be made first .
it has stored , recorded , can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands , tens of thousands of objects , actions , and their relationships in the world .
i don &apos;t have to be in a behavioral context .
or acquiring their native language abilities .
now i might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided in the world from the ears .
and we &apos;ve accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today .
my issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers , because i think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale -- and the same for kids .
you need first funds .
i &apos;m doing something serious .
but seven years ago , i went to the arctic for the first time .
i could barely breathe . i was gasping for air .
and i remember looking into the ice , and there were big chunks of white ice in there , and the water was completely black .
all of us together , we &apos;re all on the same ship together .
but what about oil ? where is it in the energy system ?
and it &apos;s just limestone , nothing really special about it .
so , when we think about the future of energy , imagine what would it be like if instead of this , we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently .
for obvious reasons , it doesn &apos;t seem that old anymore to me .
now , it turns out that i was pretty good at that .
he subsequently got married again at 102 , so he , you know , he had a lot of the life force in him .
there &apos;s an extraordinary woman named clare boothe luce .
but i hadn &apos;t asked that , and then she went off on a tear , and she said , &quot; oh , well , there was that one time that i was an actress .
and he looked at me , you know , as if to say , &quot; this is how you &apos;re going to start this thing , right off ? &quot;
this was to agnes de mille .
and the audience just -- you know , they &apos;re always on the side of the interviewee , and they felt that this was a kind of assault , but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life .
in the meantime , i was chairing donor meetings , for instance , in which the various donors , and many of them like to be in nairobi -- it is true , it is one of the unsafest cities of the world , but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable .
many of them didn &apos;t want to bribe .
civil society is pushing , civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem , also in the u.k. , and also in japan , which is not properly enforcing , and so on .
when i &apos;m walking around an art gallery , rooms and rooms full of paintings , after about 15 or 20 minutes , i realize i &apos;m not thinking about the paintings .
and it was the first time i &apos;d ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him .
he has her wear very plain clothes .
and he never does .
i have always flushed easily , from physical exertion , from wine , from high emotion .
he never used my nickname again .
and i was born in zambia .
milverton nwokedi : you cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in nigeria here .
just arrest yourself , sergeant .
action .
try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter , but no stories .
they are bought in video shops .
when people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird , and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they &apos;re photographed or seen in that space .
and they started to have a life of their own and got bigger -- as the one glass at the walker .
so , i decided to cut off the head and the tail .
we made it into a sailing craft .
i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture .
so he came back with a simpler building , but he put some funny details on it , and he moved it closer to my building .
it &apos;s in the west valley .
it &apos;s never been finished .
she didn &apos;t care where .
eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up -- and it will be very private .
i showed you the other model , the one -- this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing -- so i understood the problem .
this is a shopping thing .
these were the kind of relationships made to the chandler , composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed -- to moca , etc .
i just stuck it on there .
&lt; transcript &gt;
fossil fuels are not available , and solar energy doesn &apos;t cook the way that they like their food prepared .
so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes .
in haiti alone , about 30 million trees are cut down every year .
and now i don &apos;t actually mean the world that we live in .
one of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that .
and overlying this is the skin drape , which is a hugely complex three-dimensional structure -- taking right-angled bends here and there , having thin areas like the eyelids , thick areas like the cheek , different colors .
they say , &quot; how dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people .
well we studied teenagers &apos; attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery .
we removed all the bones at the right side of his face -- his eye , his nose , the skull bones , the facial skin -- and reconstructed him with tissue from the back .
and again , as i told you , if they have a caring family and good work life , then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives .
the truth is that there &apos;s a five-minute rule , not the tenth-of-a-second rule like todorov , but a five-minute rule .
we also don &apos;t know what they feel about recognition and identity .
we believed that where the resources and expertise are scarce , innovative , sustainable design can really make a difference in people &apos;s lives .
because i believe there is no such thing as utopia .
we went to africa , originally to look at the housing issue .
from that we also developed siyathemba , which was a project -- the community came to us and said , the problem is that the girls don &apos;t have education .
this was in august . this was the replacement , and it &apos;s supposed to last for two years .
i was 12 years old . there &apos;s a problem here .
with 10 million solutions .
the idea of needs-based competitions -- x-prize for the other 98 percent , if you want to call it that .
i think the man was maybe 25 years too early , so let &apos;s do it .
i want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds -- that you are , yourselves , authoritative about your own consciousness .
here &apos;s how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick .
he didn &apos;t mention the speed . your eye is constantly in motion , moving around , looking at eyes , noses , elbows , looking at interesting things in the world .
it &apos;s just making you expect the detail .
does your brain have to send little painters in there ?
it &apos;s easy .
and then you have the emerging world cities , with a mixed variety of vehicles , mixed land-use patterns , also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core .
this shows public support for congestion pricing of stockholm , and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced in the beginning of spring 2006 , people were fiercely against it .
and i shared their bread and their prayer .
when dave debronkart learned he had a rare and terminal cancer , he turned to a group of fellow patients online -- and found the medical treatment that saved his life . now he calls on all patients to talk with one another , know their own health data , and make health care better one e-patient at a time .
three days of fun and music .
and if you look in that red oval , that shadow was not supposed to be there .
there &apos;s so much about trust -- what sources of information can we trust ?
i had to sit down with my daughter and say , &quot; here &apos;s the situation . &quot;
and the story of how all that happens is in this book .
and i actually said at one conference a couple of years ago , &quot; give me my damn data , because you people can &apos;t be trusted to keep it clean . &quot;
well she found , through her online research , a nuclear bone scan that &apos;s usually used for cancer , but it can also reveal inflammation .
and bless yourself . thank you very much .
it wasn &apos;t just compassion for europe , though there was that .
the opportunity we &apos;re going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion , and that is the commodity booms .
that is not a forecast about how commodity prices go ; it &apos;s a forecast of the consequences , the long-term consequences , for growth of an increase in prices .
they haven &apos;t got them .
if the british treasury can be out by a factor of 10 , think what the ministry of finance in sierra leone is going to be like .

returning to india to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots -- installed briefly in madrid .
i &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time -- like an x-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .

neuroscientist and inventor christopher decharms demonstrates a new way to use fmri to show brain activity -- thoughts , emotions , pain -- while it is happening . in other words , you can actually see how you feel .
there have been three ways to try to impact the brain : the therapist &apos;s couch , pills and the knife .
i &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
and hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
i mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
so , what would happen if i showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; string theory is bogus .
whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
but again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and after five minutes , this is what you see : just a typical dead corpse , shriveled , sucked-out , dead corpse of the spider mite , and next to it , two satiated individuals of predatory mites , a mother on the left-hand side , a young nymph on the right-hand side .
you can see , by the way , in different movies , etc . , it takes just a few minutes .
you see under a microscope .
have a look at the gap .
you can probably tell frank gehry and i come from the same town .
it &apos;s the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened .
i try to make life in new york look even weirder than it is with those covers .
in ad 984 vikings went out to greenland , settled greenland , and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed , and every one of them ended up dead .
but still , you &apos;re not representing the overall population of the earth .
and here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars , locusts , bee pupae -- delicacies .
that means that we have a lot more mouths to feed , and this is something that worries more and more people .
and there &apos;s the conversion factor .
and then 80 percent of the world already eats insects , so we are just a minority -- in a country like the u.k. , the usa , the netherlands , anywhere .
so why not eat insects ?
yes , that geoffrey chaucer , in 1391 , to his little lewis , his 11-year-old son .
there is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable .
but first you need to know two things about me .
we do not think that way .
moments later , i had a surgery date just weeks away , and a big fat prescription for percocet .
just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet , it &apos;s trying to walk over a changing terrain , a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes .
robotic air powered hand with elastic ligaments .
there you go . yes !
i have linear algebra , science , physics , even nowadays , chemistry and biology , as you &apos;ve seen .
that is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form .
but we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago ?
so rather than reinvent the wheel , i began studying other professions to see if anybody had .
and if this continues , we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing , even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels .
it &apos;s the hollowing out of small towns .
and he previously was a superintendent in charleston , south carolina and then in denver , colorado .
so in order to do this , we &apos;ve taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education .
right now i should say , there are only 10 percent of the houses that actually have an in-home internet connection .
he is 16 years old , loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands , and so for him , studio h means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement .
it &apos;ll sound corny , but it &apos;s sincere .
( text : such examinations allow us to improve eye-health in many children , and ...
and we &apos;ve used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies , but i want to highlight one particular one , and that is image parsing into objects .
doctor : what are these things ?
what you &apos;re going to see are video clips of two children -- one neurotypical , one with autism , playing pong .
i went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far i could run , and about 50 meters was enough for me , panting and heaving .
you pick it up , you put the damn thing back on , and finish the goddamn race ! &quot;
and that was this collective glory -- that there was , you know , 50 people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to atlanta .
they &apos;re also silicon .
i &apos;d therefore like to propose that we employ , we enlist , the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject .
it &apos;s the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated .
it &apos;s done by geologists , engineers , biologists , all sorts of different people -- modeling and simulation .
it &apos;s a means to an end , not an end in itself , and automation allows us to have that machinery .
so there &apos;s another thing that comes up with basics .
well , another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding .
we have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward , and also our societies , based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics .
so memory capacity and disk capacity have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million .
the beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects , and the system projects down the laser beam path .
we can fly around them .
in the real world , we have people who collaborate ; we have people who have to work together , and we have many different displays .
let me leave with one final thought , and that is that one of the greatest english language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift .
ju : that &apos;s a good question , and we ask ourselves that every day .
so , i decided i would try this for a month .
a friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible , where the twenty-third psalm is rendered as , &quot; the lord is all that , &quot; as opposed to what i knew it as , &quot; the lord is my shepherd . &quot;
this was one of the huge lessons of the year , is that i almost pretended to be a better person , and i became a little bit of a better person .
how was the bible written ?
third , that thou shall have reverence .
and they said , &quot; we don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s just rituals that give us meaning . &quot;
clay shirky looks at &quot; cognitive surplus &quot; -- the shared , online work we do with our spare brain cycles . while we &apos;re busy editing wikipedia , posting to ushahidi , we &apos;re building a better , more cooperative world .
lolcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions .
and critically , the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and then an enormous accident took place .
but what a game we had , m. s. dhoni got it right in the air , but misbah-ul-haq , what a player .
everyone secretly watched them , but everyone claimed not to .
and then of course there was shah rukh playing the kolkata crowd .
move a whole tournament to south africa in three weeks .
the way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs .
and most people say , &quot; ok , i &apos;ll play . &quot;
assuming you wanted to go to hawaii , would you buy this package ?
this problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions .
and the problem , of course , is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you &apos;ll never make again .
these guys can tell us .
if we &apos;re not here in 10,000 years , it &apos;s going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young dutch fellow in 1738 , because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures .
and as the israeli mother said , she said , &quot; we never let them win by stopping weddings . &quot;
i know , because i &apos;ve interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years .
to the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future , people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way .
a more modern example comes from people who try to convince us that homosexuality is immoral .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
we can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power .
you might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject .
and so he did .
and one day i woke up and i said , &quot; well , suppose that &apos;s not true ? &quot;
i mean -- you &apos;ve got to be confident ; if you don &apos;t believe in your work , who else is going to believe in it ?
now this says , &quot; note to the viewer : i thought i might use a visual cliche of our time -- magritte &apos;s everyman -- to express the idea that art is mystery , continuity and history .
in a way , i feel like that .
boy : yeah , you could say that .
and that was something that i went through , you know , and i &apos;m still going through .
witness : we walked and walked for two days .
well done , well done .
e : then let me go .
dr. mullis was talking about his experiments , and i realized that i almost became a scientist .
i think it was circumstantial .
fg : i don &apos;t really know .
it was intuitive .
it &apos;s not his money , of course .
rsw : this is the computer building ?
rsw : ... people wanted a michael graves building .
rsw : once a shit , always a shit !
and they &apos;re actually immune to lots of evidence .
the good news about holly though is that she doesn &apos;t actually have the same kinds of technologies we do .
when we first gave it to them in their enclosures , they actually kind of picked them up , looked at them .
and that &apos;s what the monkey can for a single token .
one possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out , you know , see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years .
if it comes up tails , you lose nothing , you &apos;re fine , get to keep the whole thing -- or you could play it safe , which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those $ 100 bills , for certain .
and so this is what this looks like .
they actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started .
you can &apos;t just look at the dessert cart as say , &quot; no , no , no . that looks disgusting to me . &quot;
perhaps it was like these toddler rules : it &apos;s my stuff if i saw it first .
plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered .
this is just one example .
it starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits .
accepting his 2005 ted prize , photographer edward burtynsky makes a wish : that his images -- stunning landscapes that document humanity &apos;s impact on the world -- help persuade millions to join a global conversation on sustainability .
but we &apos;ve become totally disconnected from them .
this is a &quot; before and after . &quot; so that was before .
so they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms .
and one of the things in this picture that i wanted to point out is that when i saw these kinds of buildings , i was shocked to see that they &apos;re not using a central air-conditioning system ; every window has an air conditioner in it .
this floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor .
they &apos;ve been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while i &apos;ve been thinking .
so my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas . let them understand what sustainability is , and that they have a vested interest in it to happen .
why ? because they were old and infirm , and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything .
that &apos;s what the celebration is all about .
he insisted , &quot; i must go . &quot;
many people think of it primarily in terms of charity , random acts of kindness .
please pardon me , as a black man , for celebrating that the election of obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor .
i saw my village burned down .
and only 16 people survived that journey .
war child , child without a mama , still fighting in the saga .
so one thing i know about music : music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system , your mind , your heart , influence your soul and your spirit , and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing .
and i said , &quot; no stop until we get it . &quot;
we have like 40 kids , ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support .
and i have a dream .
how crazy is that ? that our measure of progress , our dominant measure of progress in society , is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile ?
but now for the good news !
and the point really is , is that i think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening .
the second one is be active .
but , more importantly , being seven means that you &apos;ve reached the age of reason , and you &apos;re now capable of committing any and all sins against god and man . &quot;
so , to find out that there was no santa claus at all was actually sort of a relief .
it wasn &apos;t until years later , looking back on this whole age-of-reason / change-of-birthday thing , that it dawned on me : i wasn &apos;t turning seven when i thought i turned seven . i had a whole other month to do anything i wanted to before god started keeping tabs on me .
and they said , &quot; yes . &quot;
i said , &quot; oh , come on . i mean , even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45 , assuming they didn &apos;t die from exhaustion , it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god . &quot; and they said , &quot; no . &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
believe me , it definitely wasn &apos;t easy .
she was also called simhanandini , the one who rode the lion .
but in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like .
well , documents you read , ok ?
this person was born in berlin ; berlin is in germany .
and i hope that they will put it up as linked data .
and it &apos;s not just governments , of course -- it &apos;s enterprises as well .
zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we &apos;re in right now -- the terrace theater . it didn &apos;t have a name on it .
daniel goleman on compassion
i was doing my taxes the other day , and i got to the point where i was listing all of the donations i gave , and i had an epiphany , it was -- i came to my check to the seva foundation and i noticed that i thought , boy , my friend larry brilliant would really be happy that i gave money to seva .
they &apos;re controlled by different parts of the brain .
and i spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless . and i realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go . they had a diagnosis . it made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where , when we see , when we &apos;re passing someone who &apos;s homeless in the periphery of our vision , it stays on the periphery .
i mean , companies are all about finding the right people , inspiring those people , you know , drawing out the best in people .
i mean , how big is the group overall ?
and basically , he &apos;s just taken an eye and the space station will be one giant eye , so when you &apos;re in space , you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you .
rb : just what you would do in a situation like that : just i love you very much . and i &apos;d already written them a letter before going on this trip , which -- just in case anything had happened .
and making us go on wonderful , long bike rides .
so seriously , is there a dark side ?
and so disseminating that information to around the rest of africa is important .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so , why i &apos;m telling you this , you know , maybe , you know , whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life -- it &apos;s possible .
so wherever the fire is eating the paper , that &apos;s what becomes the work -- detail .
it &apos;s just captured through from the lamp .
and this work is in the devi art foundation in delhi .
so , the same sculpture after a few days .
and then again , at that point , there is no shadow .
and i &apos;m going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing .
yet , at google , we know it &apos;s the number-one searched for category .
but then you lose control of it .
and the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year .
the second string is a melody string , which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano .
george bernard shaw said it a little differently .
it can be focused on nobody .
it may decline some more .
so off they go and she &apos;s squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time .
my dad finished dinner early that evening .
and i really discovered that my professors weren &apos;t completely wrong .
now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives .
the city of masdar in abu dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another , and they go underneath the city streets .
but as we found out with addressing co2 issues , and also fossil fuels , there is no one silver bullet .
thank you .
they said , ok , it &apos;s not about systemic change .
when we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and i &apos;ll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren &apos;t recognizing .
this is the billy bookcase -- it &apos;s ikea &apos;s biggest selling product .
so what seems like a very clunky product is , in fact , incredibly useful .
i got infected when i was 17 , when , as a student of the design college , i encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas , challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me .
and ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world .
street plays , auctions , petitions .
and i asked myself , in a way , looking back , &quot; when did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear ? &quot;
and the reference to the ipod as iconic , and in a way evocative of performance , delivery -- quite interesting that &#91; in &#93; the beginning of the year 2007 , the financial times commented that the detroit companies envy the halo effect that toyota has gained from the prius as the hybrid , energy-conscious vehicle , which rivals the ipod as an iconic product .
so , if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities , which took 200 years , then that same process is happening in 20 years .
notwithstanding the fact that the building , as a green building , is very much a pioneering building .
this is terminal four at heathrow , typical of any terminal -- big , heavy roof , blocking out the sunlight , lots of machinery , big pipes , whirring machinery .
the grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views , which give light , ventilation , make the building fresher .
larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together at heathrow -- built -- plus the new , un-built terminal five .
i had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that i found in that country , which had 60 percent landlessness but amazing creativity .
these are the three guiding principles of the honey bee network : that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language .
if this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles , you cannot be celebrating that .
and it all begins with curiosity .
so he thought , why don &apos;t i convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine ?
when you have a non-stick pan , it costs about , maybe , 250 rupees , five dollars , six dollars .
one of the greatest studies that we &apos;ve been finding is that many times investors would ask this question -- &quot; what is a scalable model ? &quot; -- as if the need of a community , which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places , has no legitimate right to get them for free because it &apos;s not part of a larger scale .
ag : many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally -- what i call a g2g model , grassroots to global .
and this breathing apparatus now saved the life , and she &apos;s very welcome .
well that was not by me .
so you begin with focal glow .
so light is , of course , for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us .
now this is not very pleasant and comfortable .
in all of these examples , i think , we should start making the light out of darkness , and use the darkness as a canvas -- like the visual artists do , like edward hopper in this painting .
yesterday , the automotive guys gave us some new insights .
and they belong on the sidewalks , and they &apos;ll use it seriously . &quot;
obviously , being a technology magazine , technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about .
the first stage in a technology &apos;s advance is that it &apos;ll fall below a critical price .
they &apos;re being commodified , and that &apos;s what happens when things go to zero . it &apos;s a tough market out there .
if you look here , here &apos;s linux in red , and it &apos;s hit 20 percent .
free is really , you know , the gift of silicon valley to the world .
&lt; transcript &gt;
patient capital works between , and tries to take the best of both .
the drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre , even if he had two , because it was too frightening , given all that he had at stake .
and it &apos;s where the idea of partnership becomes so important .
and as we got closer , its significance became apparent .
and so i urge you , in whatever sector you work , in whatever job you do , to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we &apos;re trying to help .
you may have heard about rathergate , which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the &quot; th &quot; is not typesetted on an old typewriter ; it &apos;s on word .
and my husband -- this is my husband , who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me , &quot; you cannot buy a banjo .
his father was a blogger .
you know , we &apos;re getting into china , we want to be there , but you know , there are so many people who won &apos;t have the access to write a blog .
and i remember instantly : i am in germany in this -- i had to go for a one-day trip .
now , bluefin were revered by man for all of human history .
i doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed .
we &apos;re actually measuring its oxygen consumption , its energy consumption .
the warm is the gulf stream , the cold up there in the gulf of maine .
it &apos;s a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon , sending home its data .
so what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are .
let &apos;s connect the public to this activity right on their iphone .
and when most of us get asked , &quot; where were you september 12th ? &quot;
you &apos;re basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death .
so you can see , delta 1252 going from kansas city to atlanta .
there &apos;s actually 46,000 images right now on my site , and the fbi has seen all of them -- at least i trust they &apos;ve seen all of them .
and by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you , the information that the fbi has has no value , so thus devaluing their currency .
you said , &quot; now everything automatically goes from my iphone , &quot; but actually you do take the pictures and put on information .
even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top .
highly significant relationship .
and it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others .
think of the expense , the human cost of that .
it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle , then the junior non-manual , going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors , lawyers , directors of larger companies .
there are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals .
it was my first week in federal prison , and i was learning quickly that it wasn &apos;t what you see on tv .
i was born in the 1970s , and john travolta was big in those days : &quot; grease , &quot; &quot; saturday night fever , &quot; and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me to start dancing . my parents were very up for me going .
yeah , people used to say , &quot; norman &apos;s ok , but if you followed what he said , everything would be usable but it would be ugly . &quot;
but of course , then the ball hits the other side , the ripples hit the -- poor fish , they can &apos;t find any peace and quiet .
i really have the feeling that pleasant things work better , and that never made any sense to me until i finally figured out -- look ...
with brainstorming we make you happy , we play games , and we say , &quot; no criticism , &quot; and you get all these weird , neat ideas .
automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious , controlled by the behavioral side .
and the third level is reflective , which is , if you like the superego , it &apos;s a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do , no control over the -- doesn &apos;t see the senses , doesn &apos;t control the muscles .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and he turned to me , and he said , &quot; carne , you have to be very clever to be a diplomat . &quot;
we went through several wars during my time in new york .
and this wasn &apos;t a pretty thing .
but one of the reasons that riot took place -- those riots , which went on for several days , took place -- was because the kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future .
and we started talking , and he said -- i told him what i was doing , and i told him rather grandly i was going to establish independent diplomat in new york .
us .
super-logical , you would think .
let me tell you a story .
but if you &apos;re a virus and you see this , you cross those little legs of yours and you think , &quot; we rock . &quot;
first of all , i can guarantee you that their textbooks didn &apos;t have secret agent viruses , and they didn &apos;t have horror stories .
we have to convince our audience that what we &apos;re talking about matters .
tv executive lauren zalaznick thinks deeply about pop television . sharing results of a bold study that tracks attitudes against tv ratings over five decades , she makes a case that television reflects who we truly are -- in ways we might not have expected .
that is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .
moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which i don &apos;t understand the difference between right and wrong .
viewers had responded dramatically .
another spike in the 1980s -- another spike in shows about control and power .
we &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
and this , to me , is a pretty classic manspace .
psychologist jonathan haidt asks a simple , but difficult question : why do we search for self-transcendence ? why do we attempt to lose ourselves ? in a tour through the science of evolution by group selection , he proposes a provocative answer .
the world &apos;s many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase .
we pursue our individual goals .
he said , &quot; if the one tribe included a great number of courageous , sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other , this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other . &quot;
somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another ; we &apos;ll never know exactly why -- but once they got a membrane around them , they were all in the same membrane , now all the wealth-created division of labor , all the greatness created by cooperation , stays locked inside the membrane and we &apos;ve got a superorganism .
and we are homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection , as darwin explained .
&lt; transcript &gt;
yet it doesn &apos;t say that ; it doesn &apos;t need to say that .
i like this for a couple of reasons .
and i had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house i had bought in la that the real estate person hadn &apos;t pointed out .
poster for atlantic center for the arts , a school in florida .
he &apos;s just really hoping that boots up and , you know ...
this says : &quot; one clean fits all . &quot; .
but more importantly , she &apos;s willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull .
and this delta water flows to mobile bay , and finally into the gulf of mexico .
and i remember that proverbial light going off in my head , thinking , &quot; wait a minute .
and as soon as the crabs touched the arm , it was lights out .
in fact , this whole area is like a yellowstone national park with all of the trimmings .
ah ! i know where i can shoot that .
and these problems are so large and global , and it &apos;s just overwhelming . &quot;
&lt; / transcript &gt;
now if you don &apos;t like these rules , and many of us don &apos;t -- i know i didn &apos;t , and i still don &apos;t , even though i follow them half the time , not quite aware that i &apos;m following them -- what better way than to change them &#91; than &#93; with humor ?
thank you .
and the question is : is that what edinburgh and london and new york are going to look like in 2050 , or is it going to be this ?
so the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life , is that it is scalable , it works over an extraordinary range .
despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe , there &apos;s an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this .
and here &apos;s scaling of cities .
it goes up by 15 percent , and you have a 15 percent savings on the infrastructure .
but it has a terrible catch , and the catch is that this system is destined to collapse .
that red line is from the theory .
again , &quot; thrilled &quot; to learn .
this is one of my favorite photos , because this was taken on tuesday , when i asked the students to go to the polls .
very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea -- very few good ideas are truly novel .
it &apos;s actually quite interesting . if you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care , plotted over your lifetime .
it &apos;s a wild concept .
and he asked a very important question .
this is a 78 year-old man who &apos;s lost the end of his fingertip .
these are now two years out .
in this case here , a new , wearable bio-reactor has been designed -- it should be tested clinically later this year at isr -- by joerg gerlach in pittsburgh .
but there &apos;s been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way .
like , what if one could be anyone at any time ?
isn &apos;t that adorable ?
but anyway , you know , i just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people -- literally , some of you , the architects building our brighter future .
so then i &apos;m like , should i be nervous , you know , because maybe it &apos;s better .
in fact , the older lady you just met : very , very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother &apos;s side .
good evening .
i am lesbian . &quot;
that &apos;s all , shukran . thank you very much for the opportunity .
so , tell me , how many policemen do you think are on this taxi ? and now ? three .
these are a few of them . so , what did i do ?
people still believe in voodoo . heart disease , vsd , hole in the heart , tetralogies .
if you compare it with what &apos;s on the market , price-wise , size-wise , ease of use , complexity ...
and part of it is a personal story . when chris invited me to speak , he said , people think of you as a bit of an enigma , and they want to know what drives you a bit .
the company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world .
connecting them together through conferences -- like a ted -- brings so many powerful connections , or through the world forum on social entrepreneurship that my foundation does at oxford every year .
and with screenings on the hill , and discussions , and with our social sector partners , like the national organization of women , the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal of the act .
and we think once people see these films , they &apos;ll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the middle east in general .
it was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
aaron motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and i had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
i think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
in a pre-internet world , sovereignty over our physical freedoms , or lack thereof , was controlled almost entirely by nation-states .
in fact , in the united states , whatever you may think of julian assange , even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the united states government and some companies have handled wikileaks .
because i think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens , and i would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives , not to manipulate or enslave us .
well , this is 2009 .
everybody agrees with it .
well i don &apos;t think that .
we have got skin lined with this layer .
history is strewn with the cases when they &apos;ve all got it wrong .
but you know , that makes me feel good , because richard dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood .
i was told backstage that i have 18 minutes .
and , finally , you know , become freelance .
but you come back as a duck .
ladies and gentlemen , mr. ze frank .
well , chances are i &apos;ve got a droid who &apos;s picking up the phone , &quot; yes , they called , and they said they didn &apos;t like it . &quot;
so , in paragraph number four , you &apos;re going to tell people , &quot; if no one is providing you with this information , let me help . &quot;
and so anytime i talk about what i do , i like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter .
so the ear bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say .
and just as with the wall , how i wanted to be more wall-like , with this project , i &apos;d actually like to take more a of glacial pace .
it can undergo complex reactions , some of which are happily architectural .
we &apos;re looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this .
like this .

the problem is that all over the west now it looks like this .
we pay them to leave their water in-stream .
&lt; transcript &gt;
but fun is not enough .
during the haiti earthquake , a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones .
and if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion , we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits , tones down , what i call the excessive self-obsession that &apos;s in us , therefore creating the conditions for humility .
we even created a seven-week curriculum on emotion intelligence , which we jokingly call &quot; searching inside yourself . &quot;
because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people , and it creates trust , and trust creates a lot of good working relationships .
and the third is commitment .
and she said &quot; yeah , but she &apos;s why i &apos;m here , &quot; because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .
the first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
but i &apos;m one . i can do something .
instead of having a tray with two peas , i was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother &apos;s handbag and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray .
and then there was good design for very low price .
but it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to these kind of water-sterilizing straws , so it was really wide-ranging .
and that makes sense .
and they adopted a very interesting approach to education , which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford .
afrigator is an aggregator of african blogs that was developed in south africa .
and what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don &apos;t like ?
i visited a place called parol about two hours north of mumbai .
thank you .
what did it do ?
but what is interesting about the story that i &apos;ve just said ?
there &apos;s also changing diets .
within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation .
we have a split wing .
if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses , then almost one in five indians will require eye care , a staggering 200 million people .
they feel they can train people all over the world , irrespective of different religions , cultures , all those things , to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places .
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served , which is over 50,000 people .
and , of course , one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus .
maybe there is -- the solution to the cost could be in productivity , maybe in efficiency , in the clinical process , or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables , or regulations , their defensive practice .
so , could we use that in mobile phones ?
and i &apos;ve stuck to that .
they see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in back in the subsistence farm .
you look at that lane on the right .
we are learning about how dense proximity can be .
the climate news , i &apos;m sorry to say , is going to keep getting worse than we think , faster than we think .
it &apos;s good for their prosperity .
and they increase yield , which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller , and therefore more wild area is freed up .
nobel prize-winning climatologist paul crutzen calls our geological era the anthropocene , the human-dominated era . we are stuck with its obligations .
if there is one thing bp &apos;s watery improv act made clear , it is that , as a culture , we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable , and to do so without a back-up plan , without an exit strategy .
for instance , if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker taking home 100 times more than a brain surgeon , then you need a narrative , you need a story that makes that disparity okay .
the amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume . &quot;
so that means drilling for oil in the deepest water , including the icy arctic seas , where a clean-up may simply be impossible .
as jared diamond and others have shown us , this is how civilizations commit suicide , by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes .
i have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane .
according to scientists , in 100 years all the mountain glacier will be gone .
fourth i live happily because what else should i do ?
you come from elsewhere .
the climate is changing .
dh : thank you .
bf : i think that &apos;s the next session .
bf : we &apos;ve got one more we &apos;re going to do .
bf : he invented the pencil .
dh : whenever you &apos;re ready .
is that your final answer ?
but in fact , if i were to place one base on each pixel of this 1280 by 800 resolution screen , we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome .
so a woman is age 37 .
and what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called spr , which is responsible for producing serotonin , among other things .
none , not one .
how many people in the audience have the last name resnick like me ? raise your hand .
so i am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at stanford university where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation .
this device was just fda approved in the last year .
that he was in all these other locations as well , but experiencing them as separate individuals .
quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized .
electrons have an electric charge , a negative one , and quarks have electric charges in thirds .
right now , this pattern matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles .
it &apos;s a very beautiful object , and as with any unification , we can see some holes where new particles are required there are 20 gaps where new particles should be , two of which have been filled by the pati-salam particles .
i try to balance my life equally between physics , love and surfing -- my own three charge directions .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and we believe that it &apos;s in this way that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in africa -- how these are passed from one generation to the next , through observation , imitation and practice , so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture .
working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells .
the indigenous people around the world , before they made a major decision , used to sit around and ask themselves , &quot; how does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead ? &quot;
and that led to this program we call roots and shoots , which began right here in tanzania and has now spread to 97 countries around the world .
that &apos;s a very important component of roots and shoots , with older kids talking to younger ones .
you can take an area that &apos;s absolutely destroyed , with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate .
and i thought , &quot; great .
and some of you may argue , well , don &apos;t today &apos;s cell phones do that already ?
another even more important difference is that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than today &apos;s cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that i &apos;m wearing around my neck .
9 / 11 healing : the mothers who found forgiveness , friendship
the others were brothers , sisters .
&quot; why did we want to meet her ? &quot;
michael pritchard &apos;s water filter turns filthy water drinkable
however , after a few failed prototypes , i finally came up with this , the lifesaver bottle .
that is safe , sterile drinking water .
so with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the millennium goal &apos;s target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water .
and what is happening today is , in one sense , frightening because it &apos;s never happened before .
kyoto : the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty-based organization .
if paris got together with berlin , britain got together with vienna and rome to provide a counterbalance .
increasingly , we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values , but with whom , for the moment , we share common interests .
by the way , don &apos;t ask me about ashdown &apos;s first law and second law because i haven &apos;t invented those yet ; it always sounds better if there &apos;s a third law , doesn &apos;t it ?
dan buettner : how to live to be 100 +
so to make it to age 100 , you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle , you also have to have won the genetic lottery .
and this is a place where people not only reach age 100 , they do so with extraordinary vigor .
what do they do ?
for this 102-year-old karate master , his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art .
sterling study . and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project .
she starts her day with lifting weights .
you know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you &apos;re born , because of infant mortality , and the year you retire .
many of these do-it-yourself practices were lost in the second half of the 20th century .
so a little over three years ago , kirsty boyle and i started a project we called open materials .
so based on the research by marcelo coelho from mit , hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink .
well , the only way to experience zero-g on earth is actually with parabolic flight , weightless flight .
we actually floated an apple in homage to sir isaac newton because professor hawking holds the same chair at cambridge that isaac newton did .
and these micro-machines really are at the heart of life .
and think about some of the things that we &apos;re learning about cellular mechanics .
the doggy went into doggy day care .
a reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal . and i remember thinking , &quot; if i killed myself , no one would notice . &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
we introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 , and the women who organized it said , &quot; we only want to lend to women who practice family planning .
and then we have this captain condom , with his harvard mba , going to schools and night spots .
the money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting .
&lt; transcript &gt;
however , what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart .
i don &apos;t know .
two tiny little boys .
it has evolved . if you don &apos;t like the term , change it , for goddess &apos; sake .
although women do two-thirds of the world &apos;s labor , they own less than one percent of the world &apos;s assets .
i have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart .
&lt; transcript &gt;
as we &apos;re moving into cities , the world is also embracing a western diet .
but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world .
this is an image of the great western in 1840 .
and it was a series of semi-independent city-states , if that sounds remotely familiar , a day &apos;s walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad , and grew vegetables in their back gardens , and ate communal meals together , and so on .
here , i deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable .
because i think it &apos;s an urgent question .
this is the source of all morality , this imaginative act of empathy , putting yourself in the place of another .
in this room , all this expertise , if we joined it all together , we could change the world .
so , whenever given an opportunity , i try to do something in it or with it or for it .
so i thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick .
anyway , the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff .
he saunters -- he saunters at a good clip , but as compared to all the traveling we &apos;ve just seen , he &apos;s sauntering .
so it becomes slightly three-dimensional .
he &apos;s taught them to spell his name , which is aldo .
past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that i was talking about ; beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon &quot; ristorante &quot; sign , and so on .
so these are the brilliant scientists , engineers , designers that worked on this project .
we &apos;ll have spatial computing .
so let &apos;s go out further , till we &apos;re outside the galaxy , and look back , and yeah , there &apos;s the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us .
we couldn &apos;t survive for an instant in it . language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets .
now , it &apos;s way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on .
and the controversy is global warming .
recently i visited beloit , wisconsin .
at first we thought that perhaps this was artifact .
now , in a word , the answer is &quot; rules . &quot;
when they separated , they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules .
but deng xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people .
we also need the choices for people .
allow many people to come in .
they can get basic utilities like electricity .
if we can keep innovating on our space of rules , and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules , so we don &apos;t get stuck with bad rules , then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place , so that people like nelson and his friends don &apos;t have to study any longer under the streetlights . thank you .
the experiments are incredibly simple .
and if you take all animals together , we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families .
this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware , and that &apos;s the notions that we have with biology .
so we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential , not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues .
psychologist philip zimbardo says happiness and success are rooted in a trait most of us disregard : the way we orient toward the past , present and future . he suggests we calibrate our outlook on time as a first step to improving our lives .
the kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the sat .
you can focus on past-positive , or past-negative .
i just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems : changing the drop-out rates of school kids , combating addictions , enhancing teen health , curing vets &apos; ptsd with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures -- promoting sustainability and conservation , reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate , altering appeals to suicidal terrorists , and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes .
we &apos;re having trouble feeding six billion today .
try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
you can see bridget in africa who just mapped a road in senegal .
palestinian we were told the wall would separate palestine from israel .
julia bacha : when i first heard about the story of budrus , i was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago , in 2003 .
the leaders of this movement have been using budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools .
and why is it that the wright brothers were able to figure out controlled , powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified , better funded ...
it &apos;s obvious . we go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing .
but we &apos;re also perfectly comfortable buying an mp3 player from apple , or a phone from apple , or a dvr from apple .
in other words , when we communicate from the outside in , yes , people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures .
he hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic .
the next 34 percent are your early majority , your late majority and your laggards .
look at tivo .
but he had a gift .
and it &apos;s those who start with &quot; why &quot; that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them .
and indeed , on the inputs to the hippocampus , cells are found which project into the hippocampus , which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it &apos;s exploring around .
and that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car &apos;s actually there .
more recently , in the last decade , we begin to see these communities start , hesitatingly , to come together .
this is where al qaeda is staged from .
interagency physicians come out .
so ...
now , if you &apos;re like me , and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are above-average drivers , you understand that &apos;s a very high bar .
we &apos;ve started to ask the question : can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive ?
it wasn &apos;t my culture , and i didn &apos;t particularly want to rush off and join it , but i appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it , it felt as valuable as latino culture or gay culture or jewish culture .
and she took her son home .
but i think if we lost everyone with down syndrome , it would be a catastrophic loss . &quot;
i recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no forgiveness , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; she said .
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus .
this economy won &apos;t work , &quot; and thomas jefferson saying , &quot; the people won &apos;t trust that .
it &apos;s good to let markets move resources to their more productive use .
we &apos;re not open to a discussion of eliminating it .
the vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of either camp .
throughout it all , the dollar has been one of the most long-standing , stable , reasonable currencies , and we all use it every single day , no matter what the people screaming about tell us , no matter how scared we &apos;re supposed to be .
you might have a lobar pneumonia , for example , and they could give you an antiserum , an injection of rabid antibodies to the bacterium streptococcus , if the intern sub-typed it correctly .
but when we look at the positive deviants -- the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs -- we find the ones that look the most like systems are the most successful .
the death rates fell 47 percent .
and i thought , well , maybe that old doggerel by joyce kilmer , you know : &quot; poems are made by fools like me , but only god can make a tree . &quot;
i &apos;m going to use a word that pastor rick just used -- parents are stewards of their children .
&quot; how clever of sheep ! &quot; you might say .
that was just 10,000 years ago .
the arabic word &quot; islam &quot; means &quot; submission . &quot;
you &apos;ve just heard the man .
but that is just a difference of opinion .
&quot; don &apos;t ever argue with the devil .
the world needs you , badly .
some may have considered me foolhardy , but it &apos;s been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics when talking to candidate scientists .
but through it all , look for a way to break out , to find a field and subject not yet popular .
and conversely , for every species or other entity or phenomenon , there exist important problems for the solution of which , those particular objects of research are ideally suited .
it suggests that there &apos;s all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways .
also , if you look at prison movies , sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole and when the prisoner is finished , they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again .
what happened in the sisyphic condition ?
but if you understood how important meaning is , then you would figure out that it &apos;s actually important to spend some time , energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they &apos;re doing .
would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder , or somewhere in the middle ?
it was as if you bought it in the store .
they put all this extra effort into it .
but if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on , production can increase tremendously .
it may not be very accurate , but it may make you say , &quot; hmm . &quot;
and you can see the great diversity of population densities and of per capita consumptions .
what this means is , even if you covered the whole of the united kingdom with energy crops , you couldn &apos;t match today &apos;s energy consumption .
but the same goes for renewables as well .
what can we do to it ?
i &apos;m going to be showing some of the cybercriminals &apos; latest and nastiest creations .
cybercriminals now have crime packs with business intelligence reporting dashboards to manage the distribution of their malicious code .
and it &apos;s got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website .
we then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool .
sophos _ visitors , sansemea , companies i work with .
you &apos;re going to read about malware doing incredible and terrifying , scary things .
that black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste .
it represents a colossal waste of food , but what i discovered whilst i was writing my book was that this very evident abundance of waste was actually the tip of the iceberg .
fish , 40 to 60 percent of european fish are discarded at sea , they don &apos;t even get landed .
tristram stuart : the global food waste scandal
when faced with a parent suffering from alzheimer &apos;s , most of us respond with denial or extreme efforts at prevention . but global health expert and fellow alanna shaikh sees it differently . she &apos;s taking three concrete steps to prepare for the moment -- should it arrive -- when she herself gets alzheimer &apos;s disease .
america &apos;s public energy conversation boils down to this question : would you rather die of a ) oil wars , or b ) climate change , or c ) nuclear holocaust , or d ) all of the above ?
in other words , we &apos;re going to use our most effective institutions -- private enterprise co-evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions .
audi claimed it &apos;s going to beat them both by a year .
those 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autos can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells , electricity and advanced biofuels .
that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the empire state building -- remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light , but reflect heat .
such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company .
that is , they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly .
efficiently used , it really can do our work without working our undoing .
now i &apos;ve got a live demonstration over here to show this to you .
what &apos;s the idea behind it ?
and when i was 10 , i was told that my parents left because they didn &apos;t want me .
one of the first lines of poetry i can remember writing was in response to a world that demanded i hate myself .
but the school halls were a battleground .
why else would we still be here ?
so the polyphony problem : i &apos;ve only got one voice .
common knowledge , but important nonetheless .
this is my final piece .
and i think particularly now , as we see ourselves in a time of environmental crisis , we can learn so much from these people who have lived so sustainably in this ecosystem for over 10,000 years .
the tar sands consume more water than any other oil process , three to five barrels of water are taken , polluted and then returned into tailings ponds , the largest toxic impoundments on the planet .
threatening trade wars when these countries talk about wanting to bring in positive legislation to limit the import of high-carbon fuels , of greenhouse gas emissions , anything like this , at international conferences , whether they &apos;re in copenhagen or cancun , international conferences on climate change , we &apos;re the country that gets the dinosaur award every single day as being the biggest obstacle to progress on this issue .
we need to ensure that these wetlands and forests that are our best and greatest and most critical defense against global warming are protected , and we are not releasing that carbon bomb into the atmosphere .
these comics are a fundamental way that children , especially in the diaspora , learn their religious and mythological folk tales .
these are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye .
i talked about that earlier .
patients become depressed .
this was discovered by francis galton in the nineteenth century .
so , every brain region is wired to every other region , and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .
something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus , because it &apos;s the crossroads between hearing , vision and touch , and it became enormous in humans . and something very interesting is going on .
you don &apos;t necessarily have to win . there is jerry brown .
i don &apos;t mean rod blagojevich sense of corruption .
you ignore it . this is an impossible problem .
it &apos;s solvable , not by being a democrat , not by being a republican .
open-ended , open hearth , open source , open door policy , open bar .
well , as it turns out , openness has a number of different meanings , and for each there &apos;s a corresponding principle for the transformation of civilization .
the winner was a computer graphics company that built a three dimensional model of the mine where you can helicopter underground and see where the gold is .
so we need to think differently about intellectual property .
you can see this playing out today in egypt .
it protects the birds .
they were wrong . the kids &apos; number one wish ?
companies followed the waterfall method , right , in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down to programmers below , and no one had ever consulted the programmers .
what didn &apos;t work well ? our math sheets , or greeting visitors at the door .
we &apos;ll make sunday meals more important . &quot;
just as i was leaving to come here tonight , one of my daughters started screaming .
researchers at emory gave children a simple &quot; what do you know &quot; test .
you just need to take small steps , accumulate small wins , keep reaching for that green stick .
and we do that with electricity .
now we &apos;re not going to do this in normal people .
well , you could develop flu-like symptoms .
this is a picture of fogging .
and that &apos;s exactly where we are .
nobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water , or swim in a blue algae-infested lake .
eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost .
it can go beyond the root &apos;s one-millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus .
mohamed hijri : a simple solution to the coming phosphorus crisis
it &apos;s an extraordinary change .
plants need water and nutrients .
fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment .
and raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness in humans .
otherwise , we &apos;re going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences .
gradations of intensity means what it sounds like .
as many of you know , individuals afflicted with adhd also have learning disabilities .
rather , it &apos;s acting to control two different functions on two different circuits , so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain .
but perhaps if we can attract these mosquitos to traps , bait it with our smell , we may be able to stop transmission of disease .
he &apos;s going back to check the control holes again , but he &apos;s coming back to the first one , and now he &apos;s locking into that smell , which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field , and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria .
we can use a mosquito &apos;s own instincts against her . at tedxmaastricht speaker bart knols demos the imaginative solutions his team is developing to fight malaria -- including limburger cheese and a deadly pill . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
thomas batuik : hi there , eric .
think about a coach , an agent online , that &apos;s going to help me do safe self-care .
randomized clinical trials were actually invented in 1948 to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis , and those are important things , don &apos;t get me wrong .
eric dishman : health care should be a team sport
so maybe &quot; history doesn &apos;t repeat itself , but sometimes it rhymes . &quot;
i used to teach my students that there are some things , you know , computers just aren &apos;t good at , like driving a car through traffic .
technology is racing ahead , but it &apos;s leaving more and more people behind .
erik brynjolfsson : the key to growth ? race with the machines
so what they did was they asked us an important question .
but geckos do it better .
robert full : learning from the gecko &apos;s tail
the problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
because they &apos;re experts in play . so i took my bee arena down to a small school in devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . right ?
so i &apos;m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . so here are some of the students doing the observations . they &apos;re recording the data of where the bees fly .
in other words , it starts off &quot; once upon a time , &quot; the figures are in crayon , etc .
now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ?
so -- so with that in mind , i &apos;m going to set about trying to do those things here , and talk about dying in the 21st century .
so a group of us started doing survey work , and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in newcastle , in the newcastle area , and discovered that only one in a hundred of them had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating .
and this one &apos;s the biggest growth industry of all , and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room will die in this form , which is the dwindling of capacity with increasing frailty , and frailty &apos;s an inevitable part of aging , and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now , and the last few years , or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability , unfortunately .
the small idea is , let &apos;s all of us engage more with this in the way that jason has illustrated .
she founded the hospice movement .
but it &apos;s not in an institution , it was bought by a private owner in 1998 .
because the ink was written in iron .
so this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity , speaking to us , not from the grave , because his grave doesn &apos;t exist , but from the athenian law courts .
there are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine , and one way is to extract human dna from ancient bones .
and i hope i have convinced you of the value of dental calculus .
and i looked up , and he &apos;s like , &quot; good to see you , &quot; and i was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything , and the pain was just overwhelming , and he said , &quot; you know , we didn &apos;t cut your hair . i thought you might have gotten strength from your hair like samson , and you &apos;re going to need all the strength you can get . &quot;
casual speech is something quite different .
susan : &quot; lol , i see it . &quot;
there &apos;s no electricity . people have three names .
your doctor would have to be ridiculously suspicious that you have the cancer in order to give you this test .
but it was shortly afterwards that i discovered my once brilliant procedure had something like a million holes in it , and over the course of seven months , the result ? one small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run .
she remembered , for example , when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital , and she had a lot of x-rays , and two of them were leg x-rays , which made sense , but six of them were chest x-rays , which didn &apos;t .
willful blindness is a legal concept which means , if there &apos;s information that you could know and you should know but you somehow manage not to know , the law deems that you &apos;re willfully blind .
nobody would want to go through something like that . &quot;
1998 : a single mother of four , three months after the birth of my fourth child , i went to do a job as a research assistant .
fast-forward , 2004 : in the peak of our activism , the minister of gender liberia called me and said , &quot; leymah , i have a nine-year-old for you .
girls as young as 12 being prostituted for less than a dollar a night .
so i will do this .
but in the last year , where president sirleaf comes from , her village , we went there to work with these girls .
at first , the results were predictable .
and for this task , supercomputer field brute force simply isn &apos;t enough .
again , we start by designing the human into the process .
&quot; what &apos;s your hometown ? &quot; &quot; what occupation do you seek ? &quot;
shyam sankar : the rise of human-computer cooperation
so young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies , but a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies .
so it &apos;s a little bit like microsoft kinect , where you interact with gestures in the world .
and he saw this , and he was so excited , he reached his hand out to me , and he said , &quot; thank you , thank you , thank you . &quot;
so this is an example that came from after i had sent the mother &apos;s day cards to my mom , she decided that she wanted to learn scratch .
like everyone else , we grew maize .
another machine pumps water for irrigation .
we had to beat the powerful japanese with all of their technology .
when you have 3.5 billion people living in cities -- by 2050 , it &apos;s going to be 6 billion people .
let me just show a map of rio again .
but the reason i could come here is because of that .
public services working well .
it was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although i did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
a broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person i was destined to be .
and all the while , i listened to my voices , with whom i &apos;d finally learned to live with peace and respect and which in turn reflected a growing sense of compassion , acceptance and respect towards myself .
well , today i fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox , fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most , but most of all , fueled by crates of mail like this one , my trusty mail crate , filled with the scriptings of ordinary people , strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they &apos;re ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee , but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing .
and this all changed in the late 19th century .
well , normally , a charity starts with the cause , and someone that is directly affected by a cause .
so in 2005 , the campaign got more momentum , was more successful in australia and then new zealand , and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point .
and they go , &quot; what , what do you mean ? &quot;
so now we &apos;re funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together , and that &apos;s a unique thing in the cancer world , and we know , through that collaboration , it will accelerate outcomes .
&quot; i &apos;m not interested in them . &quot;
might fail , kid . don &apos;t make a lot of money at that , kid .
life in space is really not necessarily about how we do things , but why we do things .
it &apos;s obviously also about taking responsibility , like i did here when throwing some green dye in the river in l.a. , stockholm , norway and tokyo , among other places .
so this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space .
dolphins aren &apos;t the only animals , the only non-human animals , to show mirror self-recognition .
now here &apos;s a little video .
she discovers a note she likes , finds the octave .
terri cox : hi , i &apos;m terri cox with the cameron park zoo in waco , texas , and with me i have kerajaan and mei , two of our bornean orangutans .
the production version , it uses ip version 6 .
what that means is that what we &apos;re learning with these interactions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world .
apes , dolphins and elephants are animals with remarkable communication skills . could the internet be expanded to include sentient species like them ? a new and developing idea from a panel of four great thinkers -- dolphin researcher diana reiss , musician peter gabriel , internet of things visionary neil gershenfeld and vint cerf , one of the fathers of the internet .
we keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity .
the biggest tourist attraction in china is the great wall .
the first thing , the china map missed taiwan .
unfortunately , it was the national bank of iceland .
this schism has only grown wider .
if you travel to mogadishu , mexico city or mumbai , you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas .
at its very best , the western model speaks for itself .
chen ying : &quot; when i went home for the new year , everyone said i had changed . they asked me , what did you do that you have changed so much ?
their calculations are different .
the first time i met min , she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory .
was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad , or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth , that things over time were getting better ?
could i go there ? who would i meet ?
it seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in , and i wanted to see that .
and some of these people believe that in that struggle , it is sometimes okay to take up arms .
but the good news is that the global jihad is almost over , as bin laden defined it .
last year , they took control over a portion of southern yemen , and ran it , taliban-style .
who killed bin ladenism ? al jazeera did , al jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in arabic , because they circumvented the old , state-owned television stations in a lot of these countries which were designed to keep information from people .
thank you .
eighteen minutes , clearly impossible .
now i had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly .
i found two trees -- but not any kind of trees , trees with character -- and then a very long rope .
i put my left foot on the cable , the weight of my body raised on my right leg anchored to the flank of the building .
and since what &apos;s impossible is always unknown , it allows me to believe i can cheat the impossible .
but the dove , who obviously didn &apos;t go to flying school , goes flop , flop , flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole .
i will never forget this music , and i hope now neither will you .
in the finance industry , you now have more of a right to know about what &apos;s going on , so we have different anti-bribery laws , money regulations , increased corporate disclosure , so you can now track assets across borders .
in a lot of countries , we have official secrets acts , including in britain here . we have an official secrets act with no public interest test . so that means it &apos;s a crime , people are punished , quite severely in a lot of cases , for publishing or giving away official information .
this process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness and preventing conflict , particularly over oil .
we can save half the oil by using it more efficiently , at a cost of 12 dollars per saved barrel .
so then of the energy that does get to the wheels , only an eighth of it , half of that , goes to heat the tires on the road , or to heat the air the car pushes aside .
each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist .
this creates a new million-car-a-year market for detroit from customers they weren &apos;t going to get otherwise , because they weren &apos;t creditworthy and could never afford a new car .
and yet what we proved then is the u.s. has more market power than opec .
&quot; you know , kids don &apos;t learn from people they don &apos;t like . &quot;
a student missed 18 .
we can do this . we &apos;re educators .
it dominates how we talk about arguments , it dominates how we think about arguments , and because of that , it shapes how we argue , our actual conduct in arguments .
what we need is new exit strategies for arguments .
i went to afghanistan in 2005 to work on a financial times piece , and there i met kamila , a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $ 2,000 a month -- an astronomical sum in that context .
microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect , but we must move beyond micro-hopes and micro-ambitions for women , because they have so much greater hopes for themselves .
how wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest 500 billion dollars unleashing women &apos;s economic potential ?
the women in my family are not exceptions .
number two , very quickly : how do you solve global climate change when we don &apos;t even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in congress seems to be the norm ?
my dad was , which is kind of an interesting way to grow up .
or i &apos;d make eye contact with everyone -- that was really creepy ; that didn &apos;t work at all .
it &apos;s a completely different domain .
we &apos;re five now . five .
the place was falling apart ; it was a horrible , horrible place , and i needed to go and explore the center of kinshasa to report on the rioting and the looting .
show everybody what you intend . &quot;
a few months ago the nobel prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever .
when the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up , look at what they found .
here &apos;s the idea .
because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the big bang .
because today &apos;s astronomers , by turning powerful telescopes to the sky , have captured a handful of starkly informative photons -- a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit .
and see if we can measure how well we can translate that message when we compare to the way the body does that .
the animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets .
thank you .
but i was quickly told that , &quot; boy , our government doesn &apos;t really work like that . &quot;
it &apos;s actually pretty busy .
hp : yr : i was born and raised near manchester , in england , but i &apos;m not going to say it in english to you , because i &apos;m trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent .
i have .
how do we decide who we are ? hetain patel &apos;s surprising performance plays with identity , language and accent -- and challenges you to think deeper than surface appearances . a delightful meditation on self , with performer yuyu rau , and inspired by bruce lee .
he makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us , these strong ties in our lives , actually have a homogenizing effect on us .
maria bezaitis : the surprising need for strangeness
so my journey in autism really started when i lived in a residential unit for adults with autism .
this is our body wisdom . it &apos;s not something that is mediated by our language . our body just knows that , and we &apos;ve known that for a long time .
were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point , and intervene and treat , i can tell you , and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years , this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition .
in this scan pass , in green here , are two-year-olds with autism .
i thought at the time that this was an intractable condition .
and i realized that they were performing for god , whatever that means .
so i could go from -- for instance , i &apos;ll show you some &quot; spider-man &quot; later , these incredible machines that move people along .
jt : okay .
circus , rock &apos; n &apos; roll , drama .
we make a new car every year , and then we spend the rest of the season trying to understand what it is we &apos;ve built to make it better , to make it faster .
the blue line is an indication of when patterns start to change , and immediately , before we even started putting in clinical interpretation , we can see that the data is speaking to us .
and — — no problem , but , unfortunately , continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that rafael did not paint the unicorn , did not paint the puppy dog , actually left the painting unfinished , so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn — — unfortunately , is not very reliable .
and anyone who &apos;s been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep .
but the third thing about prime numbers , mathematicians have always wondered , well at any given moment in time , what is the biggest prime that we know about ?
but one of the great things about the search for massive primes , it &apos;s not just finding the primes .
and then curtis cooper got it back .
but for me it &apos;s amazing because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time in which we live , when human minds and machines can conquer together .
thank you .
how honest are you ?
anticipation made them happy .
this is my collaborator ryota kanai .
in 2008 , cyclone nargis and its aftermath killed 138,000 in myanmar .
fortunately in 2006 , congress passed the pet evacuation and transportation standards act — it spells &quot; pets &quot; — to change that .
there are no one-size-fits-all solutions .
they wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use .
they weren &apos;t willing to engage in this .
they had to prepare a case to get rating agencies to give it a aaa , though in many cases , they had virtually bribed the rating agencies .
today we would say something like , well , imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized .
they don &apos;t know who was an ally of america in world war ii .
but i &apos;m going to argue that in reasonable doses , actually the very game i showed you at the beginning , those action-packed shooter games have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior .
audience : yellow.db : good .
who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli ?
it still sounds too low . &#93; jacques languirand : &#91; that &apos;s normal .
for a hungry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
every day , i told myself , no matter how hard things got , still i must live .
but nevertheless , my level of motivation still didn &apos;t change before he died .
many people helped me along the way to get here .
a refugee now living in the us , joseph kim tells the story of his life in north korea during the famine years . he &apos;s begun to create a new life -- but he still searches for the family he lost .
so they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
i asked the kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tubes .
year 2010 in haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so i went to santo domingo , next-door country , to drive six hours to get to haiti with the local students in santo domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
the observatory had just acquired a new book , written by a russian cosmologist by the name of joseph shklovsky , and then expanded and translated and edited by a little-known cornell astronomer by the name of carl sagan .
well , a million star systems , is that interesting ?
they &apos;re going to be ahead of us , maybe by a few thousand years , maybe by a few millions years , but substantially ahead of us , and that means , if you can understand anything that they &apos;re going to say , then you might be able to short-circuit history by getting information from a society that &apos;s way beyond our own .
you notice they make very few programs about gerbils .
five years ago , for instance , i found myself waking each morning in misty seattle to what i knew was an impossible question : what actually happened one desert night , half the world and almost half of history away ?
we close the doors and hunker down , convinced that we &apos;re in control , or , at least , hoping for control .
it involves an ongoing struggle , a continual questioning of what we think we know , a wrestling with issues and ideas .
and she told all the other people , and she said , &quot; how could it possibly be that something that &apos;s cheap and simple works as well as something that &apos;s complicated and expensive ? &quot;
so , let me show you what happens .
now he confused me from the very start , because light doesn &apos;t cool things down .
there are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you .
it &apos;s sure to help .
what happens now ? so clearly they &apos;re looking at the sun .
this is a dung beetle . watch what he &apos;s doing .
marcus byrne : the dance of the dung beetle
this is fairly amazing to me .
we shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food . so it is no use .
and it seems to me , therefore , that the doing , you know , to try to experience , to engage , to endeavor , rather than to watch and to wonder , that &apos;s where the real meat of life is to be found , the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days .
if i wanted to know , for example , how many stars were in the milky way , how old those giant heads on easter island were , most of you could find that out right now without even standing up .
statistically , one of you is a beetle .
he lives in rainforests and savannas .
all of this information is obligatory . chinese doesn &apos;t let me ignore it .
now while these findings are suggestive , countries can be different in so many different ways that it &apos;s very , very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences .
ultimately , the goal , once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making , we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future .
you and i answer only to nature &apos;s rhythm and flow , to the sun , the moon and the seasons , and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past , the present and the future to see things for what they are , to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations .
for example , it &apos;s said that there are more people in india with access to cell phones than toilets .
attention is time .
and then what happens is there &apos;s enough dust left over that it doesn &apos;t ignite into a star , it becomes a planet .
so the normal state of affairs is not to have just a homo sapiens ; the normal state of affairs is to have various versions of humans walking around .
because you have one and you don &apos;t have one , i &apos;ll give you a tenth of a second head start .
and you can map the exact pathways when a mouse sees , feels , touches , remembers , loves .
these conditions are highly rare .
and furthermore , if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas , it has to be repairable using the local tools , materials and knowledge in those contexts .
and the final point i want to make is that i think this project worked well because we engaged all the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider in bringing the technology from inception of an idea through innovation , validation , commercialization and dissemination , and that cycle has to start and end with end users .
and i was initially resistant , because i always think poetry can stand alone by itself .
the next poem is also rather short .
i lived in new york city .
and schlepping is an ancient and honorable art .
this is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee .
now look at what happens at the very end of this .
it activates the same areas in the brain .
then the next one is the pro-social token .
the other one sees that .
we manipulated people &apos;s serotonin levels by giving them this really disgusting-tasting artificial lemon-flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain .
at the end — you see where this is going — people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article .
so he &apos;s calling oxytocin &quot; the moral molecule . &quot;
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not being told .
and then twitter came along , and made things even more magic , because i could ask instantly for anything anywhere .
i maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing .
my fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million , which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date .
i see them as trust .
but i say it has to be under the conditions i &apos;ve always worked : no credit , no logos , no sponsoring .
there are tons of school projects .
lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
right ? those little buttons , i had them all expanded except for the date chart .
we &apos;d know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna , and not very much about much else .
the oed has 33 different numbered definitions for set .
they use it synecdochically .
it didn &apos;t end that way .
extreme memories for horrific brutalizations , sometimes in satanic rituals , sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements .
the false memories aren &apos;t necessarily bad or unpleasant .
with more base stations , more ground stations , better receivers and better algorithms , gps can now not only tell you what street you are on , but what part of the street .
&quot; i already have , &quot; she told me .
it might be deadly .
so something felt very wrong about the world .
communism !
according to freedom house , the number of democracies went from 45 in 1970 to 115 in 2010 .
it won &apos;t last long because it cannot adapt .
in the larger central committee of 300 or more , the percentage of those who were born into power and wealth was even smaller .
does patronage play a role ? yes , of course .
in contrast , most electoral democracies around the world are suffering from dismal performance .
meta-narrative is the cancer that is killing democracy from the inside .
are you happy with the general direction of the country ?
as i thought , that &apos;s most of you .
over the coming years , undoubtably the gates foundation is going to give a lot more , is going to save a lot more lives .
that &apos;s a good thing to do , right ?
just as he gets there , the effort becomes too much , the boulder escapes , rolls all the way down the hill , he has to trudge back down to push it up again , and the same thing happens again and again for all eternity .
it &apos;s exciting to see that in terms of what we &apos;ve learned , but how many of those 4,000 diseases now have treatments available ?
in an experiment done in cell culture and shown here in a cartoon , if you take that particular compound and you add it to that cell that has progeria , in just 72 hours , that cell becomes , for all purposes that we can determine , almost like a normal cell .
suppose we could do this instead on human cells .
would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as i slept ?
we want to avoid death , and the dream of doing that in this body in this world forever is the first and simplest kind of immortality story , and it might at first sound implausible , but actually , almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever .
&quot; death , &quot; he said , &quot; is nothing to us , because when we are here , death is not , and when death is here , we are gone . &quot;
dp : &quot; molly malone . &quot;
fantastic chap .
born three and a half months prematurely , derek paravicini is blind and has severe autism . but with perfect pitch , innate talent and a lot of practice , he became an acclaimed concert pianist by the age of 10 . here , his longtime piano teacher , adam ockelford , explains his student &apos;s unique relationship to music , while paravicini shows how he has ripped up the &quot; chopsticks &quot; rule book .
it &apos;s an ... iphone. iphone .
already in medicine , biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts , like ears , windpipes , skin , blood vessels and bone , that have been successfully implanted into patients .
it &apos;s environmentally responsible , efficient and humane .
some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause .
our community deserved a new way of doing things .
pearl arredondo : my story , from gangland daughter to star teacher
in the &apos; 90s , from 1994 to 2000 , i photographed a story called migrations .
we started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees , only local species , only native species , where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed , and the life started to come back in an incredible way .
me , one minute , it &apos;s dry . the same with the trees .
okay , let me shift gears and show you another target .
they typed in , &quot; the illinois supreme court has ruled that rahm emanuel is eligible to run for mayor of chicago &quot; — see , i tied it in to the last talk — &quot; and ordered him to stay on the ballot . &quot;
but the more we learn about aging , the clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course is grossly inaccurate .
and all things being equal , older people direct their cognitive resources , like attention and memory , to positive information more than negative .
what will happen to societies that are top-heavy with older people ?
but time we didn &apos;t get .
but we remain challenged .
help us understand how you felt after the decision .
now you can see , not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close .
there are 38,000 suicides each year in the united states .
these are scans from judy rapoport and her colleagues at the national institute of mental health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia , and you can see already in the top there &apos;s areas that are red or orange , yellow , are places where there &apos;s less gray matter , and as they followed them over five years , comparing them to age match controls , you can see that , particularly in areas like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus , there &apos;s a profound loss of gray matter .
and yet , if you take , for example , subclinical osteoporosis , a bone thinning disease , the precondition , otherwise known as osteopenia , you would have to treat 270 women for three years in order to prevent one broken bone .
but this isn &apos;t actually , despite what journalists typically do , this isn &apos;t actually about blaming particular players .
there was an important lesson for me in that .
through this experience that could only be created in a museum , i &apos;d opened up the eyes of my audience -- historians , artists , press , the general public -- to the beauty of this lost medium .
they feel that the institution is elitist .
i think expression .
it &apos;s a language . but it is not a language that can be reduced to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write .
but the one thing that can be ever simulated is the human heart , the human soul .
it can reach into sources that are not explicitly available .
i think nothing good will come out of that .
one is that , even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars , you &apos;re still better off .
em : yeah . the goal of tesla has always been to have a sort of three-step process , where version one was an expensive car at low volume , version two is medium priced and medium volume , and then version three would be low price , high volume .
em : well actually , i &apos;m confident that solar will beat everything , hands down , including natural gas .
and you really picture a future where a majority of power in america , within a decade or two , or within your lifetime , it goes solar ?
em : no , we don &apos;t patent . you didn &apos;t patent because you think it &apos;s more dangerous to patent than not to patent .
you &apos;ve never seen this before . a rocket blasting off and then -- em : yeah , so that rocket is about the size of a 12-story building .
so i think that &apos;s an important thing to do , and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback , and solicit it , particularly from friends .
for example , xcl technologies , they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new boeing 787 dreamliner , one to avoid collisions in the sky , and another to allow landing in zero visibility .
and my goodbye greeting from the chief of infectious diseases at san francisco general was , &quot; gary , this is the biggest mistake you &apos;ll ever make . &quot;
and i &apos;d heard this before as well .
and this was a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself , first 50 or 60 days , then 90 days , and then there was unfortunately another shooting in another 90 days , and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon .
where there &apos;s really been uptake even faster is in the international environment , where there &apos;s a 55-percent drop in the first neighborhood in puerto rico , where interruptions are just beginning in honduras , where the strategy has been applied in kenya for the recent elections , and where there have been 500 interruptions in iraq .
the west has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved sub-saharan debt from about 70 percent of gdp down to about 40 .
they &apos;re looking at pakistan and bangladesh , and they &apos;re also looking at africa .
so democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education .
this is indian growth from 1960 to 2010 .
no , not right now , just 30 seconds .
that &apos;s a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in texas , at brooks air base , with anthrax .
it demands that we optimize ourselves , that we control ourselves , that we self-manage continuously because that &apos;s the only way in which such a liberal society works .
no matter whether we as designers intend it or not , we materialize morality .
just like today .
and it &apos;s a little bit ironic that we set about to disrupt traditional education , and in doing so , we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional college class than other online classes .
and you &apos;ll be able to see the results from a new generation of amazing students .
it sounds so ordinary , and yet we spend so little time in the present moment that it &apos;s anything but ordinary .
or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round and round your mind .
what if i could only create with a dollar &apos;s worth of supplies ?
because ultimately , most of what we do takes place here , inside the box , with limited resources .
for example , when i studied at graduate school at queen &apos;s university in canada , the prisoners at the collins bay jail agreed to help me .
i saw my first commercially available kurzweil in march 1989 , and it blew me away , and in september 1989 , the month that my associate professorship at monash university was announced , the law school got one , and i could use it .
websites are often very visual , and there are all these sorts of graphs that aren &apos;t labeled and buttons that aren &apos;t labeled , and that &apos;s why the world wide web consortium 3 , known as w3c , has developed worldwide standards for the internet .
the writer george eliot cautioned us that , among all forms of mistake , prophesy is the most gratuitous .
the people who used to be craftsmen and hobbyists are now makers , and they &apos;re responsible for massive amounts of innovation .
and the first one is a college-educated professional , creative type , manager , engineer , doctor , lawyer , that kind of worker .
i don &apos;t know what the playbook is for getting bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life .
abraham lincoln realized there was one other ingredient .
we thought everyone could participate .
or maybe if i want to be more 21st century i could say that they are different harmonic resonances of a superstring .
but more importantly , there &apos;s our will .
maybe we can have machines help us to recognize that we have road rage and then we need to know how to control that without the machines . we even need to be able to recognize that without the machines .
i worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo , which is augmented by touch , or dresses that blushed and shivered with light .
in the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine .
and now this routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced , and others are probably the product of , has now become a tragedy .
and you do not need to be a highly trained , specialized anesthesiologist to use this machine , which is good because , in these rural district hospitals , you &apos;re not going to get that level of training .
and i founded my country &apos;s first graphic design and new media college .
africa has had a long tradition of design , a well-defined design sensibility , but the problem in africa has been that , especially today , designers in africa struggle with all forms of design because they are more apt to look outward for influence and inspiration .
and as you &apos;re thinking of the consequences of that , it &apos;s getting really hard to hide from this stuff , among other things , because it &apos;s not just the electronic tattoos , it &apos;s facial recognition that &apos;s getting really good .
but as you &apos;re thinking about narcissus , just don &apos;t fall in love with your own reflection .
but the pizza is delicious .
means &quot; where do you pay your taxes ?
several lifetimes , actually .
i never saw brian do a project like that ever again .
and so i &apos;ve heard doug tell the story many times , of his personal transformation and the breakthrough design that happened from it , but i &apos;ve never really seen him tell the story of the little girl without a tear in his eye .
you &apos;ll see broad bacterial groups , and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe , it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group .
we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation .
and the kingdom of israel , which is headed by king saul , obviously catches wind of this , and saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the philistines in the valley of elah , one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the shephelah .
now why do we call david an underdog ?
goliath is a sitting duck . he doesn &apos;t have a chance .
the pituitary tumor , as it grows , often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain , with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted .
so you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one .
we should view it as a functioning organ , part of ourselves .
my main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone , which is an underwater microphone , and this is so i can correlate sound and behavior .
this is the dolphin &apos;s sonar .
now , it turns out burst-pulsed sounds actually look a bit like human phonemes .
that &apos;s the rope whistle .
now , how far can this kind of communication go ?
&quot; minto : live &quot; brought sydneysiders into dialogue with international artists , and really celebrated the diversity of sydney on its own terms .
for &quot; the sultan &apos;s elephant , &quot; royal de luxe came to central london and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend , a time-traveling elephant .
now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession , which is , never betray the illusion .
because every phone has something in common .
now this is a task for you to focus on .
it &apos;s not back on your shoulder .
this last project is also of components .
we &apos;re so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives -- on our health , our diet , our work , our relationships , the environment and our community .
it &apos;s seen as moving in great , unhurried circles .
it &apos;s saying to the rest of world , and to the people in that town , that we believe that in the 21st century , slowness has a role to play .
and just this last month , the exam results came in , and in math , science , marks went up 20 percent on average last year .
i play squash and ice hockey , two very fast sports , and i wouldn &apos;t give them up for the world .
mental note on that one .
and this one , look how it slides sideways , every which way ?
these are my friends . oh my gosh , they &apos;re such good people .
in fact , one of them , he was ernst &amp; amp ; young &apos;s entrepreneur of the year for san diego county , so they &apos;re not , you never know who you &apos;re dealing with .
we are they might be giants .
hi there .
this next song is an original we wrote called &quot; timelapse , &quot; and it will probably live up to its name .
peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do .
they need a low deductible , and 24-hour roadside assistance .
it &apos;s that we expect them to bring us happiness .
how does that depend on what people are doing ?
now you call it a vacuum pump ; he called it a vacuum .
i mean , reality is what you can see .
and he had potassium nitrate .
and they weren &apos;t the curious little boys that liked to put frogs up in the air .
so here we have this incredible field , which has enormous hope for humanity , but much like ivf over 35 years ago , until the birth of a healthy baby , louise , this field has been under siege politically and financially .
but what you can do with human stem cells , now , is actually create avatars , and you can create the cells , whether it &apos;s the live motor neurons or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells or other kinds of cells , and you can test for drugs , promising compounds , on the actual cells that you &apos;re trying to affect , and this is now , and it &apos;s absolutely extraordinary , and you &apos;re going to know at the beginning , the very early stages of doing your assay development and your testing , you &apos;re not going to have to wait 13 years until you &apos;ve brought a drug to market , only to find out that actually it doesn &apos;t work , or even worse , harms people .
thank you .
the first quote is from jean-claude trichet when he was governor of the european central bank .
well , it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction .
are they interconnected ?
and the network really matters .
our study &quot; is an impression of the moon &apos;s surface .
now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower , the anther , and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it .
humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times .
there has been a 300 percent increase in crop production that requires bee pollination .
so go online and search for flowers that are native to your area and plant them .
amy , i think this means you &apos;re a unicorn . &quot;
this is hogwart &apos;s from the movie &quot; harry potter &quot; and that &apos;s harvard .
which means we can reverse the formula .
so we made it very small , so things were about 30 nanometers in size ; making it very cold , so at liquid helium temperatures ; and changing environment by changing the voltage , and the electrons could make flow around a loop one at a time , on and off , a little memory node .
yay !
so i like this about interactive video sculpture , that you can actually interact with it , that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves , and hopefully , one day , i &apos;ll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars .
a hundred and nine voted it a 10 , the highest . ten voted it one .
drew dernavich . &quot; accounting night at the improv . &quot;
now e.b. white said , analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog .
&quot; the rejection collection &quot; is not quite new yorker kind of humor .
it would not be with a guy with a bomb saying , &quot; too snug ? &quot;
the new yorker demands some cognitive work on your part , and what it demands is what arthur koestler , who wrote &quot; the act of creation &quot; about the relationship between humor , art and science , is what &apos;s called bisociation .
bob mankoff : anatomy of a new yorker cartoon
the economist said a few years ago that there are actually more unredeemed air miles in the world than there are dollar bills in circulation .
so government , money , war , nothing changes there , then .
you wouldn &apos;t think that skeletons and penises have very much to do with one another .
it has to be part of the explanation .
that &apos;s because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton , and that was with fibers at zero degrees and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure .
can you imagine your world without it ?
it has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet .
this is an idea worth spreading . thank you .
of course , they &apos;re all trained to work in warehouses .
it manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways .
it simply passed the national lottery act and this is what followed .
and there would be no constraints on alternative markets .
my talk today is about something maybe a couple of you have already heard about .
it was also people &apos;s deep longing for freedom .
i was meeting with a group of newly-elected parliamentarians from egypt and tunisia a couple of weeks ago .
what we &apos;ve found about the role of religion in law and the role of religion in society is that there &apos;s no female consensus .
i can help you with those later .
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline .
you could say to a principal , &quot; you &apos;re having a problem every thursday at three o &apos;clock .
now broadmoor is broadmoor hospital .
nurses will bring you pizzas .
however , we have assessed him .
he said , &quot; yeah , it &apos;s an amazing theory .
when i got back to london , tony phoned me .
and what tony is , is he &apos;s a semi-psychopath .
we went to the doctors . we &apos;ve just had a 6-million-pound health center built in todmorden , and for some reason that i cannot comprehend , it has been surrounded by prickly plants .
but what i want to do in the next eight minutes or so is to take you through how those passions developed , the point in my life when the two passions merged , the journey of learning that took place from that point .
it &apos;s a lady named leslie aiello .
i put it to you that information , if viewed from the point of food , is never a production issue ; you never speak of food overload .
but upon arrival there , in the fall of 1986 , and doing a lot of interviews , i found that the only thing i was offered was to be assistant to the art director at alfred a. knopf , a book publisher .
i miss michael .
the answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine .
now the apple guys are texting , &quot; develop odor emission plug-in . &quot;
the soundscape is made up of three basic sources .
young students are always asking me what these animals are saying , and really i &apos;ve got no idea .
biophonies and geophonies are the signature voices of the natural world , and as we hear them , we &apos;re endowed with a sense of place , the true story of the world we live in .
so where do we start ?
back to the theme of the presentation : in multidisciplinary research , how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life ?
it must be rubbish . they binned it .
we may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes .
so there &apos;s a huge scientific challenge , but there &apos;s a huge economic challenge too .
this is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease .
but now , i think , the dilemma is the cultural challenge .
i would argue today , when we are distributing tools that we &apos;ve designed and that don &apos;t necessarily make sense in people &apos;s lives , we run the risk of making the same mistake again .
every story does not have to sell something .
teenage boys lived in isolation , their bodies covered with white clay .
the imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home .
this is an msf hospital in cambodia .
military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history .
it divides the world into abrahamic religions and eastern religion , but that &apos;s not detailed enough .
look at china . they &apos;re falling fairly fast .
you need to get out of the deepest poverty so children are not of importance for work in the family .
each card box is one billion people .
but it &apos;s inevitable that we will be two to three billion more .
we had to go back the following year , all the way back to the remote parts of alaska .
where deserts freeze and waters boil .
my love is like twelve ethiopian goats standing still in the morning light .
but he was also in oxford in the &apos; 50s , and yet growing up as a child in nigeria , my father used to say to me , &quot; you must never eat or drink in a yoruba person &apos;s house because they will poison you . &quot;
and i &apos;m not saying this to save myself , although this would be nice . i &apos;m doing it to save you , because if you do this , you will be lost . &quot;
my friend ronald gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can &apos;t .
there &apos;s nothing i need from anyone except for love and respect , and anyone who can &apos;t give me those two things has no place in my life . &quot;
you might be gay .
that &apos;s the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed , because there &apos;s no protection from discrimination of glbt people .
i would like to think that he &apos;s a good boy , a respectful young man . i would like to think that i &apos;ve proven to be a capable father .
this is coal , the most common source of electricity on the planet , and there &apos;s enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year .
we built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy .
well , in most places , utility regulation hasn &apos;t changed much since thomas edison .
when we think about accidents , we usually consider them to be harmful , unfortunate or even dangerous , and they certainly can be .
jy : every year , at least 470 million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air , water and soil .
this graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates .
without flowering plants , there would be no clever , fruit-eating primates giving ted talks .
and let &apos;s explore this notion of simplicity .
this animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space .
so this is the preparation that one of my former post-docs , gaby maimon , who &apos;s now at rockefeller , developed , and it &apos;s basically a flight simulator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode in the brain of the fly and record from a genetically identified neuron in the fly &apos;s brain .
with a giant battery , we &apos;d be able to address the problem of intermittency that prevents wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal , gas and nuclear do today .
instead , let &apos;s invent to the price point of the electricity market .
so now , how to choose the metals ?
but david &apos;s young and he &apos;s smart and he wants a ph.d. , and he proceeds to build -- he proceeds to build the first ever liquid metal battery of this chemistry .
so here you have it , grid-level storage : silent , emissions-free , no moving parts , remotely controlled , designed to the market price point without subsidy .
i see you .
so in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
so business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
so we know that in primate hierarchies , if an alpha needs to take over , if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly , within a few days , that individual &apos;s testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly .
you know , so we were of course horrified , and said , oh my god , no , no , no , that &apos;s not what we meant at all .
i don &apos;t want to get there only to feel like i &apos;m not supposed to be here .
and so i want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
over the last 28 years , this tough , grinding , dirty work has been done by literally thousands of people around australia , and more recently overseas , and their work has proven that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments .
and the highest priority , you see on the screen , is washing people once a day , particularly children .
what you see on the screen -- 35 percent of those not-so-famous houses lived in by 50,000 indigenous people , 35 percent had a working shower .
twenty-one percent of the things we fix are due to faulty construction , literally things that are built upside down and back-to-front .
well , we call up the doctor of flies , and yes there is a doctor of flies .
the gas gives three to four hours cooking a day -- clean , smokeless and free for the family .
paul pholeros : how to reduce poverty ? fix homes
they &apos;re occluded , from his point of view , with a kind of gray piece of wood .
so almost 400 years ago , shakespeare was portraying adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we portray them in today , but today we try to understand their behavior in terms of the underlying changes that are going on in their brain .
see , he owned a chromium plating company , and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals , and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting .
so thanks to this student who questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true , this project taught me an important lesson about life , which is to always question assumptions .
and we &apos;ve been wondering , what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks , and thereby free the surgeons to focus on the more complicated parts of the surgery , and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster ?
about 75 years ago , my grandfather , a young man , walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that , and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen : none other than mae west , the heartthrob of the &apos; 30s , and he could never forget her .
i said , i &apos;m never going to make any honest public commentary again .
so netra and i really wanted to use our 200-year plan to curate this digital legacy , and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future .
we actually write it only to set our attitudes right .
andrew mcafee : are droids taking our jobs ?
do not tell me we can &apos;t do better than this .
so technology has changed . things have changed .
how many places in america are going to change ? none .
people used to say when they &apos;d come fund us , &quot; geoff , why do you provide these health services ? &quot;
i need that data in november .
you know , people tell me , &quot; yeah , those charter schools , a lot of them don &apos;t work . &quot;
when the safety of america is threatened , we will spend any amount of money .
why , why , why does our education system look so similar to the way it did 50 years ago ? millions of students were failing then , as they are now -- and it &apos;s because we &apos;re clinging to a business model that clearly doesn &apos;t work . education advocate geoffrey canada dares the system to look at the data , think about the customers and make systematic shifts in order to help greater numbers of kids excel .
&quot; come on . stay with me . we can do it . we can do it together . &quot;
they moved me from intensive care to acute spinal .
but you &apos;re going to get home and realize how different life is . &quot;
and even though i had absolutely no idea what i was going to do , in that uncertainty came a sense of freedom .
and as i looked up , i realized that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun .
cross-country skier janine shepherd hoped for an olympic medal -- until she was hit by a truck during a training bike ride . she shares a powerful story about the human potential for recovery . her message : you are not your body , and giving up old dreams can allow new ones to soar .
so the different elements of the project are all open , so the hardware is released with a creative commons license .
or this is something that twitters when the baby inside the belly of a pregnant woman kicks .
but let &apos;s start from this example : so , the group of people that started this company called pebble , they prototyped a watch that communicates via bluetooth with your phone , and you can display information on it . and they prototyped with an old lcd screen from a nokia mobile phone and an arduino .
i mean , it &apos;s a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine , but to share this among your peers is something different .
it &apos;s a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison .
thank you .
and this is a completely different song .
the brand has an achilles &apos; heel .
what it means is , when she sat in a restaurant in years to come , 10 years to come , 15 years to come , or she &apos;s on the beach , every so often she &apos;s going to start rubbing her skin , and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel .
in omagh , bomb went off , real ira , middle of a peace process .
now , i just want to end with saying , if we follow reason , we realize that i think we &apos;d all say that we want to have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure military perception of it .
serious problems , big problems , pressing problems .
we can &apos;t scale .
because if we can make a profit , we can do it for 10 , 100 , a million , 100 million , a billion .
it saves money .
it &apos;s real . it &apos;s happening .
i mean , how could the word scientist not have existed until 1833 ?
harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains .
on the advice of the philosophical breakfast club , the british association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy , the tides , fossil fish , shipbuilding , and many other areas .
so the ground shook in managua 60 seconds after it hit the epicenter .
by the end of this talk , there will be 864 more hours of video on youtube and 2.5 million more photos on facebook and instagram . so how do we sort through the deluge ? at the tedsalon in london , markham nolan shares the investigative techniques he and his team use to verify information in real-time , to let you know if that statue of liberty image has been doctored or if that video leaked from syria is legitimate .
just alert us by beeper .
a few years after i started this organization , in a jewish community , two muslims from east jerusalem called me up .
forty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations .
and it raises really interesting questions about , how will we plan cities ? how will finance development ?
well when i was asked to do this tedtalk , i was really chuckled , because , you see , my father &apos;s name was ted , and much of my life , especially my musical life , is really a talk that i &apos;m still having with him , or the part of me that he continues to be .
it &apos;s so simple , so evocative .
so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big &apos; what &apos; was to praise god .
this is when those big forms arose -- the symphonies , the sonatas , the concertos .
he came over to a piano that was there , and he balanced himself and began playing something like this .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a basketball player , a tennis player , a gymnast or a bridge player .
the u.s. is tied for 15th in reading , but we &apos;re 23rd in science and 31st in math .
let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s going on today .
our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars .
and here &apos;s this really sophisticated technology coming down the road , all these associated social , moral , ethical questions , and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we &apos;re doing in those labs .
i &apos;m not going to minimize those concerns .
i could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science .
he was infected with hiv .
unfortunately , these good laws are counter-balanced by a mass of really bad law -- law which is grounded in moral judgement and in fear and in misinformation , laws which specifically punish people living with hiv or those at greatest risk .
the nurse said to me , &quot; why should you people bcome pregnant when you know you are hiv positive ?
now drug use or possession is illegal in almost every country .
so for example , outreach workers who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations are not themselves subject to police harassment or abuse or arbitrary arrest .
i am an undercover journalist .
but my colleagues didn &apos;t know .
it was easier to get cannabis , heroin and cocaine , faster even , in the prison than outside the prison .
thank you . stay safe .
to intentionally harm people psychologically , to hurt people physically , to destroy people mortally , or ideas , and to commit crimes against humanity .
so the lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations with these three factors .
the experimenter says , &quot; don &apos;t worry , i will be responsible .
you saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in abu ghraib .
understanding is not excusing . psychology is not excuse-iology .
she came down , saw that madhouse and said , &quot; you know what , it &apos;s terrible what you &apos;re doing to those boys .
because it may only happen once in your life , and when you pass it by , you &apos;ll always know , i could have been a hero and i let it pass me by .
there was no software that could compete at this kind of arena .
and it made me think , what does this mean , if we &apos;re going to be able to start outsourcing , not just lower unimportant brain functions .
that &apos;s often the advantage of time .
now the problem is , when you can &apos;t smoke , if you stand and stare out of the window on your own , you &apos;re an antisocial , friendless idiot .
one of my great friends , a professor called nick chater , who &apos;s the professor of decision sciences in london , believes that we should spend far less time looking into humanity &apos;s hidden depths and spend much more time exploring the hidden shallows .

in reality , take a guess .
just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world assembled at alma-ata and made this iconic declaration .
there are three principles on which human life flourishes , and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure .
but teaching is a creative profession .
i mean , other animals may well have imaginations and creativity , but it &apos;s not so much in evidence , is it , as ours ?
and the reason i think is this : that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions of education .
and if we can encourage more people , that will be a movement .
and so what is symmetry ?
let &apos;s do the reflection in x first , followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise .
leaving something incomplete makes it interesting , and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth . &quot; thank you .
it &apos;s also a complete faa database .

i had &quot; anne frank , &quot; &quot; the great escape , &quot; &quot; shoah , &quot; &quot; triumph of the will . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have much money , but i had time and a sense of wonder .

so that was kind of a clue that things weren &apos;t right .
ruby wax : what &apos;s so funny about mental illness ?
and it &apos;s meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the internet , in a less linear form .

i &apos;m so experienced that when you went to the fell school and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child in it , that was me , but kicked me out when i was caught teaching the fairy boys how to rob the pats off a pair of lee jeans and bring them to vim . let me see chekhov pull that off .

indeed , this was , i think , best said by marie curie who said that one never notices what has been done but only what remains to be done .
sometimes we call them bull sessions .
and secondly , how the hell can we tell the difference between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom ?
stuart firestein : the pursuit of ignorance
so three weeks later , the times revisits the story .
shankar vedantam is the author of &quot; the hidden brain : how our unconscious minds elect presidents , control markets , wage wars , and save our lives . &quot;
sean gourley : exactly . so we took 24,000 tedx talks from around the world , 147 different countries , and we took these talks and we wanted to find the mathematical structures that underly the ideas behind them .
it has mathematical structure , and we can use that mathematical structure to go and explore things like the world of ideas to see what &apos;s being said , to see what &apos;s not being said , and to be a little bit more human and , hopefully , a little smarter .
as a magician , i try to create images that make people stop and think .
i started to think , if the boy could survive without breathing for that long , there must be a way that i could do it .

by 7 : 08 i started to black out .
i walked into the new york times offices and did card tricks to everybody .

john is the subject . beat is the verb .
the sexual abuse of children .
but one of the powerful roles that men can play in this work is that we can say some things that sometimes women can &apos;t say , or , better yet , we can be heard saying some things that women often can &apos;t be heard saying .
just like with heterosexism , if you &apos;re a heterosexual person and you yourself don &apos;t enact harassing or abusive behaviors towards people of varying sexual orientations , if you don &apos;t say something in the face of other heterosexual people doing that , then , in a sense , isn &apos;t your silence a form of consent and complicity ?

that is over 20,000 deaths a year .
and participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance , well , they were less stressed out , less anxious , more confident , but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed .
and when oxytocin is released in the stress response , it is motivating you to seek support .
the compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others , and yes , your pounding physical heart , working so hard to give you strength and energy , and when you choose to view stress in this way , you &apos;re not just getting better at stress , you &apos;re actually making a pretty profound statement .
now , why worry ? why worry about our becoming market societies ?
who thinks it &apos;s worth trying this .
we live and work and shop and play in different places .
it maxes out in the 1930s , &apos; 40s and &apos; 50s , and then it starts slowing down , and here &apos;s a cautionary note .
and then we have inequality .
those horses also ate up fully one quarter of american agricultural land .

the relationship evolves over time .

and there i was , lying there in this tiny space , hot , dark , claustrophobic , matchbox-sized , behind my eyes , but it was really weird , like , after this went on for days , weeks , months , that space would get bigger and darker and cooler until i really looked forward to that half an hour of enforced immobility and rest , and i really looked forward to going to that place of darkness .
or can we do it as an exclusive membrane ?

the genes don &apos;t care but we do ?
this is the wave , going from left to right . you can see this one .

curiosity and passion .
you believed in your principles .
that diagonal line is the truth line . if their dot &apos;s on it , they were telling exactly the truth .
our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing . they also used the first person singular , i , way more than the people that actually stayed there .
man 7 : after this bridge , first exit .
it &apos;s been really important to make it comfortable .
it &apos;s when everybody is able to take them for granted .
they were twittering it .
relatively sparse number of producers .
media , the media landscape that we knew , as familiar as it was , as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs , is increasingly slipping away .
this is the opening of a beautiful novel by jose saramago called &quot; seeing . &quot;
and it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand .

the richest country .
as i stand under them , i see not just a cloud , but understand that what i have the privilege to witness is the same forces , the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy , our solar system , our sun and even this very planet .
so i &apos;d like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn &apos;t existed before ; imagine a mining industry that doesn &apos;t mean defiling the earth ; imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine .

and ushahidi , which means &quot; witness &quot; in swahili , which geocodes and crowdsources information in complex emergencies to help target responses .
and the leading point of view on this , whether measured by number of books sold , mentions in media , or surveys that i &apos;ve run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the world trade organization , is this view that national borders really don &apos;t matter very much anymore , cross-border integration is close to complete , and we live in one world .

we sat in a car on the avenue paulista in são paulo , together .
i &apos;m talking instead about threats that are headed our way , but they &apos;re wrapped in a special energy field that polarizes us , and therefore paralyzes us .
no , i &apos;m not even going to look up . no . &quot;
the polarization is strongest among our political elites .
but i &apos;d like to supplement their work with a little psychological trick , and the trick is this .

if airports can become shopping malls and mcdonald &apos;s can become playgrounds , surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room .
do they have food to take with the prescription ?
