it &apos;s that pyramid .
those females are passing the pcbs in the fat of their own mother &apos;s milk into their offspring , and their offspring don &apos;t survive .
but at least it &apos;s labeled correctly , and you &apos;re no longer going to be buying toxic dolphin meat instead .
these vibrios , these bacteria , can actually infect people .
the canneries are gone . the pollution has abated .
ak : haa haa haaa .
bj : and here again , you see the same structure .
this is in the national theatre studio , the place where they cook new ideas .
and together , there &apos;s quite a complex possibility of tail expression .
and it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
thank you .
wiser sets out to document , link and empower what paul calls the largest movement , and fastest-growing movement in human history : humanity &apos;s collective immune response to today &apos;s threats .
xigi is a new community site that &apos;s built by the community , linking and mapping this new social capital market .
the pictures that you &apos;re seeing behind me are people that i visited in the last few months .
they skype with their families a few times a week .
if you think nursery , kindergarten , first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children , to make them used to staying long hours away from their family .
i &apos;m always surprised the u.s. army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance , of soldiers in iraq having daily contact with their families .
first , we believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car , that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers .
it &apos;s extraordinary to watch .
look for the tree , and down .
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn &apos;t move out of their neighborhoods .
and by presenting a really strong economic case , they convinced the l.a. government that replacing that asphalt with trees and other greenery , that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on horticultural infrastructure .
but the back of my t-shirt , the one that she gave me , says , &quot; save the endangered hillbillies . &quot;
we can create these local markets and incentives for recycled materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
the recession has us reeling and fearful , and there &apos;s something in the air these days that is also very empowering .
i spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
as such , it deserves no compassion , it deserves no treatment as minority martyrdom , and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness . &quot;
should she say , &quot; you &apos;re just like everyone else but a little bit shorter ? &quot;
but acceptance is something that takes time .
one of the families i interviewed , tom and karen robards , were taken aback when , as young and successful new yorkers , their first child was diagnosed with down syndrome .
this is what we hear when you pray for a cure -- that your fondest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces . &quot;
and i figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so .
during these 10 years , i had witnessed and learned the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility , and i had come to see how it conquers everything else .
we all need help , even those of us who are very seasoned .
that pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody .
the mesh network , the reason i -- and i won &apos;t go into it in great detail -- but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world , they &apos;re connected . there &apos;s not just laptops .
in each case , got the ministers , went through a lot of the stuff .
tell people about it ! it &apos;s got to become viral , ok ?
but what i &apos;m here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some of our deepest civic issues , if we apply open source collaboration .
what we &apos;re doing is what nasa or a large corporation would call r &amp; amp ; d , or research and development .
and when i look out in the future , i can &apos;t imagine a world , 500 years from now , where we don &apos;t have robots everywhere .
see , the three-year-old kids , they don &apos;t worry about it .
the worst thing that &apos;s happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters .
there was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing , and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end .
voice : look at my smile .
and on the first -- you know , this has been a very hollywood theme with lots of movies . you probably recognize these characters here -- where in each of these cases , the robots want more respect .
and the watchmaker turned around and said , &quot; god can see it . &quot;
and when that happens , are you sitting there going , &quot; no , the movie &apos;s about to start , &quot; or are you going , &quot; that &apos;s fantastic . i &apos;m looking forward to it .
where are you feeling this ?
so it wasn &apos;t about symmetry .
did you see what i did ?
and the great thing is , this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it &apos;s green technology and it &apos;s good for you and it &apos;s light and it &apos;s all part of the future .
they &apos;re the things that you &apos;d snatch if the house was on fire .
if you don &apos;t believe in a religion , there &apos;s nothing wrong with picking and mixing , with taking out the best sides of religion .
you know , in the 18th century in the u.k. , the greatest preacher , greatest religious preacher , was a man called john wesley , who went up and down this country delivering sermons , advising people how they could live .
i &apos;ll just come across it . &quot;
they don &apos;t just give us books or words about this .
what do organized religions do ?
one wants to say , &quot; nonsense . why not ? &quot;
so it took me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , to underground mines in the japanese alps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole .
and where in the world would you find such water ?
but nonetheless , it &apos;s an extraordinary piece of engineering .
this is a cosmic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere to an altitude of 40 km .
and what struck me was every place that i went to to see these telescopes , the astronomers and cosmologists are in search of a certain kind of silence , whether it &apos;s silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever .
then the question is , what do you get ?
and it actually -- so technologically , it works .
the chinese did over a million , and the egyptians are about 30,000 .
exactly what loaning means , i &apos;m not quite sure .
we &apos;ve found , also , a lot of political films , a lot of amateur films , all sorts of things that are basically needing a home , a permanent home .
so universal access to all knowledge -- i think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind , like the man on the moon , or the gutenberg bible , or the library of alexandria .
this gift came to me about five months ago .
and the spores are germinating , and the mycelium forms and goes underground .
and all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix .
they &apos;re showing how much nutrition that they could &apos;ve obtained .
there &apos;s a vetted press release that you can read -- it &apos;s vetted by dod -- if you google &quot; stamets &quot; and &quot; smallpox . &quot;
you could fly 100 ph.d. students under the umbrella of this concept , because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi , prior to sporulation , attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores .
and the wonderful thing about that is that i get to compare biospheres .
can you take this biosphere , that has evolved on a planetary scale , and jam it into a little bottle , and will it survive ?
and so we were working to sequester carbon .
except that i knew i could walk out the airlock door at any time , if it really got bad , though who was going to say , &quot; i can &apos;t take it anymore ! &quot; ?
in fact , i would stand for hours in the aisles of shops , reading all the names on all of the things .
they were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people .
we &apos;re very uncomfortable with untidiness .
it &apos;s hard enough to learn to get the skills , try to learn all the material you have to absorb at any task you &apos;re taking on .
autonomy was our highest value .
two million people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they didn &apos;t have because someone failed to follow the basic practices of hygiene .
it &apos;s not a system .
i did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a harvard surgeon worrying about checklists .
this is not yet our norm in surgery -- let alone making checklists to go onto childbirth and other areas .
now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
so even though we &apos;ve lost 30 percent of the colonies every year , the same number of colonies have existed in the country , at about 2.4 million colonies .
you know , they pick up their hives ; they move their families once or twice in a year .
they build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom .
white-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
and i encourage you to look at that .
and they had some , in my opinion , terrible christmas music .
so what happened now is i &apos;m standing here in rotterdam , in the beautiful city , on a big stage , and i &apos;m talking about whistling .
geert chatrou : thank you . thank you .
we have david attenborough .
and so if you need to study this sleeping problem , it &apos;s easy to study on plants , for example , than in animals and it &apos;s much more easy even ethically .
we have almost 14 million roots .
stefano mancuso : the roots of plant intelligence
this goes on for another four stops .
and i stood in the park giving signals .
but also , don &apos;t shop .
it &apos;s morning rush hour .
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
thank you .
this is ted , and i want to talk about design .
i &apos;m going to use a word that pastor rick just used -- parents are stewards of their children .
we all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists -- they &apos;re not very smart .
10,000 years ago at the dawn of agriculture , human population , plus livestock and pets , was approximately a tenth of one per cent of the terrestrial vertebrae landmass .
in that case , a parasite gets into a mouse and it needs to get into the belly of a cat .
it &apos;s a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes -- updating them , quietly dropping obsolete features , putting new interpretations on other features .
there would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on earth . &quot;
and what i find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral , if you want to have meaning in your life , you have to be an intelligent designer -- you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection .
a very clever little meme .
it &apos;s got no destination in mind -- it &apos;s just enjoying the journey .
we may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
and four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved .
and you know , it had a profound effect on me .
we think we already know how something works , so we can &apos;t imagine how it could work .
i don &apos;t even have access to a facial piercing if i wanted to .
aluminum foil . everybody has a cat .
most people cannot play them that way .
we can see them indirectly , because black holes wreak havoc on their environment .
but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity .
and if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light lensed around it , and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened .
the sound you &apos;re hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
there &apos;s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called lisa .
it &apos;s like hurry , build your instruments .
i simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig .
that , i think , is movement .
and at the same time , we &apos;re fighting another battle .
i was an outsider who had come back to iran to find my place , but i was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution .
being a visual artist , indeed , i am foremost interested to make art -- to make art that transcends politics , religion , the question of feminism , and become an important , timeless , universal work of art .
it needs the help of mother , or a foster mother , to survive .
what they have sweated so far has no meaning .
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness .
your own experience reveals , in spite of all limitations , you are the whole .
you fake it and make it . this is the mantra of the united states of america .
they told me that they preferred me on youtube than in person .
it &apos;s good for motivated students .
so i put a big c stamp on your forehead and then i say , &quot; here &apos;s a unicycle . &quot;
red means they &apos;re stuck .
and as valuable as that is in los altos , imagine what that does to the adult learner who &apos;s embarrassed to go back and learn stuff that they should have before , before going back to college .
so we made that focus diagram .
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
she was a bright old lady , perfectly sane . she had no medical problems .
the first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair .
another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination .
you hear the traffic . all the senses are involved .
and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells , which can be very , very specific .
now , 250 years later , i think we &apos;re beginning to glimpse how this is done .
but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally inadequate to the task .
this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this .
so what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle ?
and this is a burglar alarm .
and he transformed our understanding of the moon .
this was work from a number of years ago .
they &apos;re called mircrotubules . that name &apos;s not important .
so swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution , so startling in its countless twists and turns , that no one can predict its outcome even a decade from the present moment .
i speak as an authority on that subject , because i &apos;m an extreme case .
there is the quickest way advances are likely to occur , as measured in discoveries per investigator per year .
e.o. wilson : advice to young scientists
and from literate populations , new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge , religion and politics .
yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students , a significant percentage would reject any offer that &apos;s not close to 50 / 50 .
and yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging .
a transdisciplinary study of cooperation ?
so , we see the imagery , of course , not stopping at the sky .
ok , george , can you pan back over to the corner market ?
i want to talk a little bit today about labor and work .
but knowing that nobody would ever watch that made him quite depressed .
and if they said yes , we gave them the one that they built and we broke .
soon after i finished running this experiment , i went to talk to a big software company in seattle .
and we had three conditions .
and ikea is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble .
we had the people who built it , and we had the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers .
and when you were about to leave , the parents said , &quot; hey , by the way , just before you leave , if you &apos;re interested , they &apos;re for sale . &quot;
thank you very much .
i think it &apos;s the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used .
last year , the khmer rouge tribunal , which the u.n. is helping cambodia take on , started , and i decided that as a matter of record i should file a civil complaint with the tribunal about my father &apos;s passing away .
because people don &apos;t have tools to cope with it , to get over it .
and i started thinking about a counseling program .
and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future . &quot;
let &apos;s say the productivity of biofuel plantations is 1,200 litres of biofuel per hectare per year .
so &apos;s germany , and japan is consuming a bit more .
and that means , if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference for a country like the united kingdom on the scale of today &apos;s consumption , you need to be imagining renewable facilities that are country-sized , not the entire country but a fraction of the country , a substantial fraction .
if you really want to get a bit closer to swedish building standards with a crappy house like this , you need to be putting external insulation on the building as shown by this block of flats in london .
from the very first rehearsal , i saw the bright future ahead .
he is the musical director of los angeles philharmonic , and is still the overall leader of venezuela &apos;s junior orchestras .
education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge -- is the means to strive for a more perfect , more aware , more noble and more just society .
now , what are some of the other advantages ?
each frame of the movie has information about itself .
and one child , whose name i &apos;ve forgotten , was about seven or eight years old , absolutely considered mentally handicapped -- couldn &apos;t read , didn &apos;t even make it in the lowest section of the school &apos;s classes -- and was pretty much not in school , though physically there .
and the fact that we knew the people -- we had to take a page out of the history of walt disney -- we actually went so far as to build crts in the shapes of the people &apos;s faces .
all right ? that &apos;s the first time .
how do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that &apos;s going to help us with prevention of disease , early onset of disease , and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time ?
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
when intel does surveys all around the world and we say , &quot; quick response : healthcare . &quot;
raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household , or any of your loved ones , your parents or so forth . right ?
this is an example in our tril clinic in ireland of -- actually what you &apos;re seeing is she &apos;s looking at data , in this picture , from the magic carpet .
so , i hope you &apos;ll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward .
but it is that social thing that i guess attracted michael crichton .
and i and my colleagues cut into it , and we were able to determine , by looking at lines of arrested growth , some lines in it , that b-rex had died at the age of 16 .
we now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs .
you heard that occasionally children are born with tails , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s an ancestral characteristic .
and quite frankly , i think if colonel sanders was to be careful how he worded it , he could actually advertise an extra piece .
that black line in the middle of that table is the likely level of consumption with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste .
the next three biscuits are the foods that we decide to feed to livestock , the maize , the wheat and the soya .
if we do that to fruit and vegetables , you bet we can do it to animals too .
it &apos;s unscientific . it &apos;s unnecessary .
change it ! come on ! what ?
i mean kids are studying this stuff and they &apos;ve got the word &quot; fluctus &quot; up there . that &apos;s wrong .
the first consideration , make it clear , simple and unambiguous .
must have been a very interesting day in the shoemaker house .
the dodecahedron , it &apos;s dual .
getting back to the point of my particular presentation , kepler , one of my great heroes , who realized that these five solids , which i spoke of earlier , were related somehow to the planets , but he couldn &apos;t prove it . it freaked him out .
this is , of course , the cartesian coordinates .
i know that scares a lot of you , but that was my purpose entirely .
i knew those two were related .
not stamps , but one day .
so i picked think.com , but then i thought , you know , there &apos;s a lot of really interesting names out there .
now , china telecom says it was just an honest mistake , and it is actually possible that it was , the way things work , but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to , and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes .
it &apos;s turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system , where we &apos;ve designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have .
however , this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the western world regarding these emerging cyber weapons .
just 3 years ago , both the u.s. and france were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace , strictly to defend their it systems .
just last week , in a new york times article dated january 26 , 2010 , it was revealed for the first time that officials at the national security agency were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks in cases where the u.s. was about to be cyberattacked .
this is what i saw . i saw hills and valleys .
so some of them actually seem to have powers like superheroes in a comic book .
and i kind of broke the mold with sherman .
so , i sent them to boise , idaho , where they dropped a plastic bottle into the boise sewer system .
and he clicks the &quot; buy now &quot; button .
it &apos;s a valley where , in a long day , perhaps , too , you can follow the tracks of grizzly and wolf and drink from the very sources of water that gave rise and cradled the great civilizations of the northwest coast .
the tahltan have called for the creation of a tribal heritage reserve which will set aside the largest protected area in british columbia .
no .
let me try to take this one step further .
if each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine , that will be the four-digit number that i &apos;ll square .
good . then i shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable .
audience : november . november what ?
audience : 1966 .
audience : eight . eight .
i hope you enjoyed mathemagics . thank you .
they know .
that was a month of my life .
bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
we were off by 25 percent . how many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
i &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
the entranceway to the bell tower .
so where does this lead ?
seriously , but dangerously fun .
they are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals .
and there &apos;s a whole other type of play , which is object play .
imaginative play .
so what happens ?
and we are , by physical anthropologists , by many , many studies , the most neotenous , the most youthful , the most flexible , the most plastic of all creatures .
an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another , disruptive to the day .
sb : well , i think the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that i have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play .
so this is a plate of nachos .
but where is this going ?
the combined coverage of russia , china and india , for example , reached just one percent .
it &apos;s a letter from &quot; artforum &quot; in 1967 saying &quot; we can &apos;t imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art . &quot; and they still haven &apos;t .
so in addition to using full-body input , something that i &apos;ve explored now , for a while , has been the use of the voice , which is an immensely expressive system for us , vocalizing .
but jaap is one of the world experts in performing it .
so let &apos;s run this and see if it works .
just one eye , looking at you , and eliminating everything else about a face , but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of , as an element .
and i &apos;m really happy to be here . thank you so much .
and the basic objective of this work is not to just go out once and look at these individuals , but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis .
they &apos;re also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that hiv entered into the human population , and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this , why did we let these behaviors continue ?
and this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message , whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention .
it &apos;s also working in live animal markets -- these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where sars emerged in asia .
now , the fundamental idea is that twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want , be they momentous occasions or mundane ones .
this really changed how we perceived twitter .
that was very interesting .
they stirred my imagination . they opened up new worlds for me .
what struck me was this : she had felt sorry for me even before she saw me .
therefore they were not authentically african .
when i learned , some years ago , that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful , i began to think about how i could invent horrible things my parents had done to me .
now , the conventional wisdom was that nigerians don &apos;t read literature .
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind : &quot; they sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of paradise was regained . &quot;
it literally flat-lined .
this doesn &apos;t mean having to get a ph.d .
best buy , the consumer electronics company , gets all its employees -- the cleaners , the shop assistants , the people in the back office , not just its forecasting team -- to place bets , yes bets , on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before christmas , on whether customers &apos; new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company , on whether a project will come in on time .
my dad was a bilingual college professor . his hobbies were chess , bridge and writing op-eds .
so i &apos;m doing activities that will build my sense of balance .
not how do you build one car , but how do you scale this so that it can become something that is used by 99 percent of the population ?
a full battery comes on . and you drive on .
today 2010 , in volume , when we come to market , it is eight cents a mile .
three of them never showed up . one of them asked us if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount .
and pick the two best places -- the one where you didn &apos;t need any range extension .
in other words at some point when we &apos;ve recovered we go up to the peak .
now where is the car industry on that ?
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year we can &apos;t stop thinking of padding co2 .
forget about the hybrid auto -- shai agassi says it &apos;s electric cars or bust if we want to impact emissions . his company , better place , has a radical plan to take entire countries oil-free by 2020 .
but here , i want to say something nice about creationists .
my approach to attacking creationism is unlike the evolution lobby .
but suppose -- -- in 1987 , a reporter asked george bush , sr .
you can &apos;t help wondering why vote-seeking politicians are so proverbially overawed by the power of , for example , the jewish lobby .
i &apos;m not a citizen of this country , so i hope it won &apos;t be thought unbecoming if i suggest that something needs to be done .
you think we might have grown up since then .
critical mass may be harder to achieve with the word &quot; atheist &quot; than with the word &quot; non-theist , &quot; or some other non-confrontational word .
starting with newspapers , what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information , knowledge and culture , which led to a stark bifurcation between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital , just like any other industrial organization -- and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce .
now , if you have a little girl , and she goes and writes to -- well , not so little , medium little -- tries to do research on barbie .
but what we &apos;re seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange .
that &apos;ll give me something i can use , and i &apos;m going to contract with someone .
today , alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail .
we have to reform our economies , change our leadership , become more democratic , be more open to change and to information .
nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies , and three or four others have come in .
we have opportunities in agriculture , like i said .
conflicts are down on the continent ; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago , we are down to three or four conflicts -- one of the most terrible , of course , of which is darfur .
i could go on giving examples : beatrice gakuba of rwanda , who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the dutch auction in amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her .
are we safer today ?
so that &apos;s really how vaccines work .
so , you &apos;ve got this situation : in 2003 , we had an h5n1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent .
we saw earlier that hiv is highly variable , that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus .
so far , animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease , although you might get a mild case .
so right now , the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains , and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu .
no longer does aids need to kill two million a year .
seth berkley : hiv and flu -- the vaccine strategy
even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid .
africa &apos;s begging-bowl leaks .
and i asked them to name me just 20 good leaders , just 20 good leaders -- you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself .
in many african countries the modern sector is lost .
and even if you look in ancient african empires , they were all organized around one particular principle -- the confederacy principle , which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority , decentralization of power .
nonsense .
this is where we need to mobilize africans , in the diaspora especially , to invest in this .
even if you &apos;re logged out , one engineer told me , there are 57 signals that google looks at -- everything from what kind of computer you &apos;re on to what kind of browser you &apos;re using to where you &apos;re located -- that it uses to personally tailor your query results .
so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at netflix .
i know that there are a lot of people here from facebook and from google -- larry and sergey -- people who have helped build the web as it is , and i &apos;m grateful for that .
she said &quot; yes , that &apos;s former vice president al gore and his wife tipper . &quot;
cars and trucks -- i talked about that in the slideshow , but i want you to put it in perspective .
over time , people do what you pay them to do . and if they judge how much they &apos;re going to get paid on your capital that they &apos;ve invested , based on the short-term returns , you &apos;re going to get short-term decisions .
that &apos;s really true . i said the other night , and i &apos;ll repeat now : this is not a political issue .
when the water goes down , they know what to do .
and congressman markey asks , you know , &quot; is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes ? &quot;
and he moved away because it was his last fishing trip , and he knew that the dolphins scare fish .
there was nothing ready , and , you know , as we can see by what they &apos;re doing .
i refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident .
there &apos;s certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this .
and i assembled this in my garage , and it now lives in the physics department of the university of nevada , reno .
and yet , i would like to think that i am more than my genes .
that &apos;s a lot of information .
if we continue through the entire stack , we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron .
one neuron can be connected to so many other neurons , because there can be synapses at these points of contact .
at the present time , my collaborators and i , what we &apos;re aiming for is much more modest -- just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain .
do not forget that groove in the earth called the stream bed .
so we &apos;ll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain .
resurrection might succeed for the body , but not for the mind .
imagine taking the same material , but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker .
now , you see the magnet fell really slowly .
now , zach , we &apos;re going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future .
shape-retaining is common in metal : you bend a piece of aluminum foil , and it holds its place . contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back .
and he kind of comically explained that time after time , what the firemen would say is : they would rush to the scene of the crime ; they would look around ; if there were no dead policemen , it was ok to go .
more grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime .
huh , amazing .
i &apos;ve never seen it . have you ?
their dna is to find the conditions that are conducive to life .
true story .
that &apos;s the one we &apos;re not normally offered .
we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply .
the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers .
also today &apos;s military revolution in energy efficiency is going to speed up all of these civilian advances in much the same way that military r &amp; amp ; d has given us the internet , the global positioning system and the jet engine and microchip industries .
so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately .
but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy , not by getting better pumps , but just by replacing long , thin , crooked pipes with fat , short , straight pipes .
well efficiency and gas can displace them all at just below their operating cost and , combined with renewables , can displace them more than 23 times at less than their replacement cost .
and those utilities were rewarded , as they still are in 34 states , for selling you more electricity .
and our new book &quot; reinventing fire &quot; describes how you can capture it .
today , each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment .
in this map from moldova , the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes , and the red color shows the opposite .
thank you .
and to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth , i must imagine : who owns this mouth ?
yes , she said , something like that . ok , that means we are at half of the story .
ok , i can see , if i found something , up , up , and they continue , up up up .
what , what else we can say about that ? why do that ?
but i know that even i do it the best possible -- that &apos;s why i &apos;m the best -- it &apos;s nothing .
what i want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what &apos;s scheduled .
i say , &quot; now listen . in the army , when we want you to pay attention , we have a command . it &apos;s called &apos; at ease . &apos; it means everybody be quiet and pay attention . listen up .
in 18 weeks , they have a skill . they are mature .
and by the third grade , the kids who didn &apos;t have that structure and minding in the beginning start to realize they &apos;re behind , and what do they do ?
give him to the army . we &apos;ll never see him again . we &apos;ll never see him again . &quot;
we don &apos;t have time to waste for that .
and i would order the hot dog from the guy , and he &apos;d start to fix it , and then he &apos;d look around at the bodyguards and the police cars -- &quot; i &apos;ve got a green card ! i &apos;ve got a green card ! &quot;
hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now , 24 / 7 .
traditional business wisdom holds that trust is earned by predictable behavior , but when everything is consistent and standardized , how do you create meaningful experiences ?
because everyone was a hero .
but they are still feeling the pain of the egyptian .
the leader was everyone on that page .
what we see here is that language has a critical period for learning .
so the question is : what &apos;s happening during this critical two-month period ?
what we did was expose american babies during this period to mandarin .
she &apos;s a six-monther .
now this happens very fast , in the blink of an eye , so , together with lg , we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than 3,000 frames per second .
so what happened now is , when the watercolor was flowing into the structure , the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid .
so the images that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle , and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees .
every year or so , i have the privilege of taking clinicians into the himalayas and the tibetan plateau .
but the conditions for compassion to be activated , to be aroused , are particular conditions .
i say that , for thousands of years , women have lived , exemplified , met in intimacy , the archetype of avalokitesvara , of kuan-yin , she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world .
in terms of applications , fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often .
now , as much fun as it is to discover these patterns , it &apos;s even more satisfying to understand why they are true .
the other founding members included ahmed ahmed , who is an egyptian-american , who actually had the idea to go to the middle east and try it out .
i said , &quot; well , he &apos;s passed away , but his name was khosro . &quot;
like a couple months ago in times square in new york , there was this pakistani muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb .
and you learn great things about these places .
&quot; on the third floor , sir . on the third floor . &quot;
so i would like to show you something i &apos;ve been working on .
some people deceive for money .
using three ipods like magical props , marco tempest spins a clever , surprisingly heartfelt meditation on truth and lies , art and emotion .
they &apos;re under constant mechanical forces .
we can get incredible functionality inside these little chips .
now we have a whole pipeline of different organ chips that we are currently working on in our labs .
there are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead to at-risk populations that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction .
it &apos;s relatively easy to imagine a new medicine , a better cure for some disease . the hard part , though , is testing it , and that can delay promising new cures for years . in this well-explained talk , geraldine hamilton shows how her lab creates organs and body parts on a chip , simple structures with all the pieces essential to testing new medications -- even custom cures for one specific person . &amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ;
so , the guy replies , &quot; yeah , i know , i know .
as part of their strategy the red brigades never spoke with anybody , not even with their lawyers .
in the 1970s , the turnover of the red brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars .
and what is even more shocking is that this system has followed , step by step , the evolution of our own system , of our western capitalism .
rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history .
the u.s. in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
i told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers , including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family .
and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking , &quot; oh boy , i &apos;m on totally the wrong track here .
i was euphoric .
i don &apos;t know for sure that the brits invented this particular view of the world , but i suspect we might have done so : we are right in the middle , and we &apos;ve cut the pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world .
but it doesn &apos;t react very well to being immersed in ocean , which is what happened to it .
and that made me think about how would i feel if britain was going to disappear under the waves ; if the places where i &apos;d been born and gone to school and got married , if all those places were just going to disappear forever .
but when i wrote that obituary exercise , i actually grew up a little bit in that moment and realized that i needed to create my own future .
so anyway , today we &apos;ll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimism .
this one , this is going to be the new world trade center : a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it .
one very young , one a little more mature .
so they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune .
the current king of the romantics , who approaches his work in a very different fashion .
this is about a place in london called kiteflyer &apos;s hill where i used to go and spend hours going &quot; when is he coming back ? when is he coming back ? &quot;
when i was nine , i saw the movie &quot; jaws , &quot; and thought to myself , &quot; no , thank you . &quot;
poetry .
this led to a full-scale investigation , and i was removed from the house for three days , until they finally decided to ask how i got the bruises .
the classics were , &quot; hey stupid , &quot; &quot; hey spaz . &quot;
what is possible with the human voice ?
but in actual fact , i haven &apos;t made this machine so that i can emulate things that already exist .
and the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one .
unfortunately , when i was there i couldn &apos;t find one of them , but you have the antlers as proof .
if i stand beside that truck , my head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap .
oil sands -- or rather i should say tar sands -- &quot; oil sands &quot; is a p.r.-created term so that the oil companies wouldn &apos;t be trying to promote something that sounds like a sticky tar-like substance that &apos;s the world &apos;s dirtiest oil .
the boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense against global warming and climate change .
and the great bear rainforest is generally considered to be the largest coastal temperate rainforest ecosystem in the world .
i hope that you will all , if you &apos;ve been moved by this presentation , join with the growing international community to get canada to step up to its responsibilities , to convince canada to go back to being a climate change champion instead of a climate change villain , and to say no to the tar sands , and yes to a clean energy future for all .
here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot .
but i can only hope i &apos;ve whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in india today .
okay , now getting to a part -- i want to show design in illusions . i believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye . so that when you saw from one little angle was like this . and this little technique got popular in the 16th century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings , where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this .
and this is what happens to that food web when it &apos;s stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before .
so for any problem , the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity , the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most .
when we &apos;re on our deathbeds , will we regret the time we spent playing games ?
and stanford university has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar changes how we think and act in real life , making us more courageous , more ambitious , more committed to our goals .
we also collected and activated power-ups .
it should , because the top five traits of post-traumatic growth are essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying .
so tackling a tiny challenge without giving up , even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly 50 times or counting backwards from 100 by seven is actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower .
it turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience -- physical , mental , emotional and social -- live 10 years longer than everyone else .
just to give you an idea of scale , that installation there is about six feet across , and the tallest models are about two or three feet high .
so i had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery .
it &apos;s almost impossible to model this structure any other way , and it &apos;s almost impossible to do it on computers .
i have a straight line on my spherical surface .
it &apos;s a bit like this : imagine that we &apos;d only ever encountered euclidean space .
even mathematicians , who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers , literally couldn &apos;t see not only the sea slugs around them , but the lettuce on their plate -- because lettuces , and all those curly vegetables , they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry .
we want to propose , chrissy and i , through the institute for figuring , another alternative way of doing things , which is the play tank .
this is called the capgras delusion , and that is a patient , who &apos;s otherwise completely normal , has had a head injury , comes out of coma , otherwise completely normal , he looks at his mother and says , &quot; this looks exactly like my mother , this woman , but she &apos;s an impostor .
now , when that area &apos;s damaged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
now , what happens if you show this patient ?
if only i could move it , maybe the pain will be relieved . &quot;
he had his arm amputated 10 years ago .
it &apos;s a completely useless ability , if you think about it .
but , it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis , and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors .
now , there may be some truth to this , because it &apos;s much more common here in the bay area than in san diego .
different shapes for different phonemes , right ?
it permeates their entire life .
this shows the bonobo compared to an australopithecine like lucy .
i hope i have a lighter .
realizing that nyota might get hurt , panbanisha , like any human mother , carefully tugs to get the scissors back .
compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard .
do that real fast part that you did . yeah , that part .
and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before darwin &apos;s simple beginning , to set our earth in a cosmic context .
well , we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the big bang , but we still don &apos;t know what banged and why it banged .
well , most of you anyway .
equally untidy office there , as you can see .
the continental landmasses drifted around .
so we see it in religions and self-help books , that money can &apos;t buy happiness .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot;
they &apos;re also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things .
but enormously different motivations here .
and then we can see , well now we &apos;ve got teams that spend on themselves and we &apos;ve got these prosocial teams who we give money to make the team a little bit better .
you and i can go on and buy it for them .
now , from the shah &apos;s perspective , though , he wanted to keep this as secret as possible , so when yitzhak rabin , for instance , traveled to iran in the &apos; 70s , he usually wore a wig so that no one would recognize him .
netanyahu , when he got elected in 1996 , reached out to the iranians to see if there were any ways that the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected .
so , today i &apos;m back just to show you a few things , to show you , in fact , there is an open data movement afoot , now , around the world .
and i &apos;m delighted to see a great competition between the u.k. in blue , and the u.s. in red .
there &apos;s the map showing , on the left-hand side , that hospital -- actually that &apos;s a hospital ship .
i &apos;m a performer .
john gartner wrote this book called &quot; the hypomanic edge &quot; in which christopher columbus and ted turner and steve jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete .
so i didn &apos;t expect that , but -- i mean , i expected you could synchronize .
and only today is science starting to figure out how it works .
yes , it &apos;s happening here .
for a long time it was not believed when the first western travelers , like sir francis drake , went to thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle .
this is a klutz just playing with some water bottles .
he would shoot his light saber across the abyss , making a blade of light , and then scamper across on this blade of light .
boy : we had to do this because , to keep in balance because if you didn &apos;t keep your balance , then you would just fall over about , like , to the left or right , about 45 degrees .
this synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge .
but then , of course , everyone is driving the bridge .
i don &apos;t know if we named the apple or if the apple named us , but ...
we have to get climate-ready crops in the field , and we have to do that rather quickly .
agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth .
the fact : population growth in countries with high laptop -- i need hans rosling to give me a graph .
now , i have some mini ted prizes , this is the philips bodygroom , one for our leader .
now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today , but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes .
we retreated in &apos; 98 back to something that was developed in &apos; 56 . what ?
and i think i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company .
there &apos;s a group of people that have come forward -- and you don &apos;t know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children , this little three- to 15-year-old age , by us going to orbit and going to the moon here , right in this time period .
it &apos;s commercial . it can be defined as space tourism . they are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon , like apollo 8 was done .
the technology revolution is opening the world .
and we need to change and open up all of our institutions .
the market value of his company goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars , and i can tell you , because he &apos;s my neighbor , he &apos;s a happy camper .
but you also need to have values .
knowledge and intelligence is power , and as it becomes more distributed , there &apos;s a concomitant distribution and decentralization and disaggregation of power that &apos;s underway in the world today .
the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom .
it protects the birds .
so why should we care about blood vessels ?
this is a tumor : dark , gray , ominous mass growing inside a brain .
and you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment .
but starting in 2004 , when antiangiogenic therapies first became available , well you can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer , multiple myeloma , colorectal cancer , and gastrointestinal stromal tumors .
and we want to measure this because , well , while you &apos;re eating a strawberry or drinking tea , why not select the one that &apos;s most potent for preventing cancer .
now , obviously , what i &apos;ve shared with you has some far-ranging implications , even beyond cancer research .
do you recommend pursuing these treatments now , for most cancer patients ?
the question is , which letter is it if i unfold it ?
the progression of my career that you &apos;ll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact .
this appears in my puzzle calendar .
i wanted to make a sequel .
so , we &apos;re making smart games for social media .
and we have people all over the world doing that now .
and i will tell you that what happened is through that shattering , listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated , who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes , literally , inside them where their pee and poop came out of them .
and what i want to suggest is that , having talked to girls , because i just finished a new book called &quot; i am an emotional creature : the secret life of girls around the world , &quot; i &apos;ve been talking to girls for five years , and one of the things that i &apos;ve seen is true everywhere is that the verb that &apos;s been enforced on girl is the verb &quot; to please . &quot;
when we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls , who have run away , with their families .
i love that i do not take things lightly .
they found photos of him . they prepared a photo array , and the day after the shooting , they showed it to one of the teenagers , and he said , &quot; that &apos;s the picture .
they retained me , as a forensic neurophysiologist , because i had expertise in eyewitness memory identification , which obviously makes sense for this case , right ?
we had him stand actually slightly in the street , so closer to the suspect vehicle , the shooter vehicle , than the actual teenagers were , so he stood a few feet from the curb toward the middle of the street .
and what does this example -- what &apos;s important to keep in mind for ourselves ?
and there &apos;s no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape ; we can use any seed shape we like .
and he said , &quot; oh yeah , yeah ! we knew about a rectangle within a rectangle , we know all about that . &quot;
and the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales .
and finally , well , isn &apos;t this just intuition ?
and his answer was very interesting .
and finally , he revealed the truth of the matter .
the national science foundation &apos;s broadening participation in computing program recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools , so hopefully in three years , anybody &apos;ll be able to go on the web and create their own simulations and their own artifacts .
&apos;i am a mathematician , and i would like to stand on your roof . &apos; that is how ron eglash greeted many african families he met while researching the fractal patterns he &apos;d noticed in villages across the continent .
one of those kids tutors math on the far side of town .
in sutherland &apos;s system , companies don &apos;t use large , massive projects that take two years .
but the real change didn &apos;t come until we had these family meetings .
i &apos;m proposing three planks .
if you &apos;re sitting on a cushioned chair , you &apos;ll be more open . &quot;
every minute above that , we have to do one pushup .
we had a pajama party .
spend time retelling the story of your family &apos;s positive moments and how you overcame the negative ones .
if you &apos;re feeling helpless help someone if you &apos;re feeling helpless help someone if you &apos;re feeling helpless help someone if you &apos;re feeling helpless help someone people of hope people of change people of love , joy , no shame i believe the almighty knows each and every one of you by your name thank you .
and it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air .
sobule : paul mccartney , jealous of john , even more so now that he &apos;s gone . dylan was so mean to donovan in that movie . pablo picasso , cruel to his wives . sweeney : horrible .
his name was nikola , nikola tesla .
nt : i had bigger ideas .
so as i said , neurosurgery comes from a long tradition .
you see the electrode going through the skull into the brain and resting there , and we can place this really anywhere in the brain .
so here he is now , back in israel where he lives , three months after the procedure , and here he is .
so we &apos;ve placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix , which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit , with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit , and whether that can , in turn , help these patients with alzheimer &apos;s disease .
contrary to calculations made by some engineers , bees can fly , dolphins can swim , and geckos can even climb up the smoothest surfaces . now , what i want to do , in the short time i have , is to try to allow each of you to experience the thrill of revealing nature &apos;s design .
and then they alternate in their propulsion , but the patterns are all the same . almost every organism we &apos;ve looked at this way -- you &apos;ll see next week , i &apos;ll give you a hint , there &apos;ll be an article coming out that says that really big things like t. rex probably couldn &apos;t do this , but you &apos;ll see that next week .
it just bends by itself beautifully .
it has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front , and the hind leg on the other side . sort of an alternating tripod , and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal .
here are the robots that they inspire , the mecho-geckos from irobot .
how do they do it then ? believe it or not , they grab on by intermolecular forces , by van der waals forces .
it was a lot like the stirling engine : it was cool , but you didn &apos;t know what to do with it .
and we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have .
now people talk about this a lot , and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women .
and then carrie reads all the books in the original greek and latin , goes to all the lectures .
and she &apos;s an operator in a company in silicon valley , and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist .
i think the cause is more complicated .
i think it would be a better world .
people brush and floss their teeth .
this is still the way we &apos;re communicating messages about health .
your blood pressure might drop a little bit .
and so i was thinking about , what &apos;s an opportunity that i could have to help people understand information ?
now a lot of our effort on this one -- as many of you probably know , a psa test is a very controversial test .
that &apos;s what engagement is . it &apos;s different from compliance .
so , let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way , besides some entertaining insights about human desire .
this is how soil is created .
remember when images were first possible with a computer , those gorgeous , full-color images ?
free bold feels like mandela free .
and many people ask me , john , couldn &apos;t you just digitize all this ? make it all digital ? wouldn &apos;t it be better ?
and what is that , structurally ?
there may be different subdivisions in the organization , and you might want to look into different areas . for instance , green are areas doing well , red are areas doing poorly .
and the tools , the resources that we use to build a game layer are game dynamics themselves .
to win , all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time .
it &apos;s also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings .
one of the things that we work on at scvngr is how do you use games to drive traffic and drive business to local businesses , to sort of something that is very key to the economy .
now i hope all of you feel better .
and pretty much everywhere there is power , there is the internet .
and what that means is we want to have more people who are healthy and educated .
you can see , even though the u.s. is still the majority here -- though , by the way , search-wise , it &apos;s only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it &apos;s already going to japan , and the u.k. , and europe , and all the rest of the countries .
and this was kind of a surprise to me , but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head , which you did by writing them down , that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources .
but anyway , every year we &apos;ve taken the whole company on a ski trip .
but finding things is tricky , and so you really want intelligence .
we accept payment for advertising , and we mark it as such .
and to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made , which meant building long viaducts across river valleys -- this is actually the viaduct across the thames at maidenhead -- and long tunnels such as the one at box , in wiltshire .
conversion sound has developed a high quality , ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid for the developing world .
hilary cottam , charlie leadbeater , and hugo manassei of participle have taken this idea of participation , and in their manifesto entitled beveridge 4.0 , they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state .
so these are some that we &apos;ve been asked to think about recently .
in response , he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation .
in reality , the kids who were told what to do , whether by miss smith or their mothers , were actually given the very same activity , which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen .
when the participants arrived for their interview , i offered them a set of drinks : coke , diet coke , sprite -- seven , to be exact .
they practice this from such an early age that they &apos;ve come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability .
they had all suffered the same tragedy .
when it comes to choice , we have far more to gain than to lose by engaging in the many translations of the narratives .
on the top line , this is the bp oil spill : billions of barrels of oil gushing in the gulf of mexico .
and , playing , i realized that the maneuverability of this was really amazing , and i could avoid an obstacle at the very last second , more maneuverable than a normal boat .
so if you &apos;re looking at the boat from this side , this might remind you of an airplane profile .
they also made it into an instructable , and in less than one week , they had almost 10,000 views , and they got many new friends .
to get a sense of this , and it &apos;s been a theme we &apos;ve talked about all week , i recently talked to a bunch of tweeners .
now , i think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities , or the media community , is driven so crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently .
ph : you know , so much was worked out : the first real-time interaction , the video display , pointing a gun . it lead to the microcomputer , but unfortunately , it was too pricey for the navy , and all of this would have been lost if it weren &apos;t for a happy coincidence .
that &apos;s roughly a third more nuclear power than all of france creates .
come on into the secret lab .
and it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet , but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else &apos;s affairs .
the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song . the lyrics go , &quot; remember what the dormouse said .
yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology , the digital superhighway .
ph : we missed a lot . you know , you missed , we missed the internet , the long tail , the role of the audience , open systems , social networks .
voice 2 : well , there goes the neighborhood .
ph : i think it &apos;s a great time of enthrallment .
down the road , there was another building , a nice visual structure : horizontal , vertical elements , little decorative lines going across , these magenta squiggles , the workmen being reduced to decorative elements , just a nice , kind of , breakup of the urban place .
i notice this stuff because i walk a lot , but here , private industry is really kind of making a mess of the public sector .
but this was real romance to me .
so my romance was temporarily shifted .
so my idea was that , instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls , that you would sit on the chair , and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline .
would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone ?
the mosquito has killed more humans than any other creature in human history .
so the next time you get dengue fever , if it &apos;s a different strain , you &apos;re more susceptible , you &apos;re likely to get worse symptoms , and you &apos;re more likely to get the more severe forms , hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome .
the second way you can do it is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around .
and most of the time , you &apos;ll find this insect lives in and around your home , so this -- whatever we do has got to get to that insect .
in about four months of release , we &apos;ve brought that population of mosquitos — in most cases we &apos;re dealing with villages here of about 2,000 , 3,000 people , that sort of size , starting small — we &apos;ve taken that mosquito population down by about 85 percent in about four months .
so for the mosquito , it &apos;s a dead end .
we all have these .
so , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
for every community in the united states , you could have your own personalized map of that .
bill davenhall : your health depends on where you live
he forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-christmas.mom , who downloads the boy in the orchard , the emperor of oranges , who grows up to be me -- the guy who usually goes too far .
why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture ?
and now , looking at this picture , which speaks for itself , we see modern agriculture , which i also refer to as intensive agriculture .
so that really puts it into perspective .
this slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza .
even though it is present in the soil , it is in insoluble form .
what i thought i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that &apos;s tracked by architecture .
so , the mutations reverted to symmetry .
it also is much more dynamic , so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it , because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it .
now , as an architect , part-to-whole relationships is all i think about , but in terms of product design it &apos;s becoming more and more of an issue for companies .
and we looked at , from the 1950s on , there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing .
in fact , what you &apos;re seeing here are soybean fields .
those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains far to the east , where snow melts , it travels down the river through the desert , and forms the great aral sea .
it &apos;s more than all our electricity .
right now , it &apos;s kind of an all-or-nothing proposition .
some dry up altogether .
jonathan foley : the other inconvenient truth
we &apos;re all focusing on — this is a statistic from earlier this month in the financial times — we &apos;re all focusing on the luxury economy .
well , i guess . you know , china has no — — no intellectual property , right ?
what i &apos;d like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter , and actually all the way down into the sewer because i want to talk about diarrhea .
to sort of illustrate that , this diagram emphasizes that if you &apos;ve got a sick person in bed , somebody &apos;s going to be taking out the contaminated materials .
so what happens , if you &apos;ve got an organism , it produces a lot of toxin .
and peru &apos;s got something sort of in between .
did chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance , whereas did ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem ?
and this really cool experiment was done about 200 miles south of there , in northern alabama , by the tennessee valley authority .
but as i said earlier , this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases , and it ought to .
and when you lose one , far less both , it &apos;s a lot harder to do the things we physically need to do .
you squeeze your hand , these muscles contract .
and these are very exciting research areas , but it &apos;s really , really hard .
and after six months , the nerves grew in well , and you could see strong contractions .
he &apos;s about four or five times as fast with this simple little performance metric .
tk : okay , this was my goal .
and i also have the hand closed and open .
it goes into that mode , and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand .
this arm -- they &apos;re always made for the 50th percentile male -- which means they &apos;re too big for five-eighths of the world .
she was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she &apos;d received during the trial , or even what the trial had been about .
local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials , as well as the incentives for participation .
if you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company , i challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound .
and i doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes .
when we have extreme el nino events , you see all this red , and you see no green out here around the galapagos .
but , in fact , when we went to argentina , penguins were often found totally covered in oil .
and what the penguins show us -- and these are all the little dots from where the penguins &apos; positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 -- and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests .
and now look at this : not friendly .
imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way -- if nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes and put an ad in the paper like that .
it &apos;s about following your own dreams -- uninvited , uninvited -- and then working with others to make those dreams come true .
that &apos;s probably more than at any time in centuries .
you had the creation of new states in eastern europe , the former yugoslav republics and the balkans , and the &apos; stans of central asia .
well , just on the other side of the amo river , in the heilongjiang and harbin provinces of china , you have over 100 million people .
these vectors and arrows represent ever stronger trade relationships that china has with every country in the region .
so what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world ?
palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly because it &apos;s two parts palestinian , one part israel .
before it was , how do we control their oil ?
in fact most of that happened on just one day .
let &apos;s not neglect the insurgency just to the south , balochistan . two weeks ago , balochi rebels attacked a pakistani military garrison , and this was the flag that they raised over it .
thank you .
you know , even if you &apos;ve never seen one of these little c. elegans -- which probably most of you haven &apos;t seen one -- you can tell they &apos;re old -- isn &apos;t that interesting ?
so maybe it &apos;s working in people the same way .
but what good is this for the worm ?
so i &apos;m really optimistic , and i think it won &apos;t be too long , i hope , before this age-old dream begins to come true .
mr : thank you very much indeed , cynthia kenyon .
charles darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors , as he wrote in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals .
and that &apos;s a bit reminiscent of adhd , which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans .
rather , it &apos;s acting to control two different functions on two different circuits , so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain .
well , in africa , we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s crashing every day .
and they &apos;re accessible . you can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there , right ?
just kidding , just kidding .
as the demand for donor organs continues to rise , in large part due to the aging population , the supply has remained relatively constant .
now just about that time , the practice of surgery evolved from big to small , from wide open incisions to keyhole procedures , tiny incisions .
if this research is successful , it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .
there are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease .
a mexican composer : arturo marquez .
well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out .
so what else can you do to safeguard your marriage ?
dr. gero is a brilliant but slightly mad scientist in the &quot; dragonball z : android saga . &quot;
so in this situation too , to decode the information contained in patterns like this , watching alone won &apos;t do .
now let &apos;s take a look at these miraculous receivers up close .
so it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity .
we thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the critic , we should be able , artificially , to nag the actor into changing its policy .
in this electronic toy circuit , the mushroom body neurons are symbolized by the vertical bank of blue leds in the center of the board .
and i ended up in student health , and they ran some labwork and came back right away , and said , &quot; kidney problems . &quot;
all right , i gotta gel up .
and you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with dr. batiuk .
i had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school , when we &apos;re under treatment for the kidney , and suddenly , they &apos;re like , &quot; oh , we think you have a heart problem . &quot;
these population studies that we &apos;ve done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives , but the problem is that health care is treating us as averages , not unique individuals , because at the end of the day , the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied . that &apos;s what &apos;s leading to the guesswork .
ed : well , i probably will never get a chance to say this to you in such a large audience ever again .
so here &apos;s gdp per person in america .
i &apos;m optimistic , because the new machine age is digital , exponential and combinatorial .
recently , its teachers let it surf the internet unsupervised .
people are racing against the machine , and many of them are losing that race .
and the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends .
well we know that tails store fat , for example .
so there is the landing target . could they steer towards it with these capabilities ? here it is in the wind tunnel .
the nations that brought it up when we had the speeches of the national leaders -- it tended to be the leaders of the small island states , the low-lying island states .
the ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet .
and winds averaging about 40 knots for most of the voyage and up to 70 or 80 knots .
and these plants need sunlight , so we know when we find that sediment there &apos;s no ice overhead .
and so , when a coral colony is killed by an el nino event , it leaves this indelible record .
that the place where , during an earthquake in 1954 , this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly , and it was lifted up about six to seven meters .
here &apos;s a synthetic diagram .
you know , we &apos;re pumping out lots of co2 into the atmosphere , from fossil fuels , from cement production .
now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean , with co2 levels lower than they are today .
this is donna eating ice cream .
i looked at this big empty wall with three lonely photographs that were , you know , very pretty photographs and i was like , i failed at this .
but between us , if i &apos;m offered a job with fox , i &apos;ll take it .
in the arab world -- and it &apos;s not really by the film ; it &apos;s by the characters .
if you were not abu azzam &apos;s daughter ...
i deal with children all the time .
there &apos;s working films and there &apos;s current tv , which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their -- yes , it &apos;s amazing .
and if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching , then i think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better .
how is it that the sun , 93 million miles away , &#91; that &#93; somehow it affects the motion of the earth ?
so kaluza says , maybe i can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves .
but if we zoom in and take the perspective of , say , a little ant walking around -- little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions -- the long dimension , but also this clockwise , counter-clockwise direction .
so deep inside -- we all know , you go sufficiently far down , you have atoms .
now you might think about that and say , well , ok , you know , if you have extra dimensions , and they &apos;re really tightly curled up , yeah , perhaps we won &apos;t see them , if they &apos;re small enough .
so what is the physical implication , though , relevant to those 20 numbers ?
so this is the kind of experiment that we &apos;ll be looking at in the next five , seven to 10 years or so .
and if you haven &apos;t seen it yet , you &apos;re dead . right ?
and yet you don &apos;t put a letter after that first &quot; t. &quot;
that is your perceptual reality . the physical reality is that those two tiles are the same .
now she is drinking a glass of water that &apos;s about that big to you and i , will do that about three times , and then fly .
so , working with kids , they created images , thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them .
beau lotto : optical illusions show how we see
okay ? we &apos;re talking about irresponsibility in public office .
it was a constitutional outrage of the first order , and i have labeled it the plot to pervert parliament .
and i was walking around with the protesters looking at the one wall street , occupy wall street movement walking around .
it &apos;s not just like anywhere . it &apos;s not just like anywhere .
that is the law since 1999 .
the third thing i will tell you is that i also asked for the directors of cl financial , whether in fact they were making filings under our integrity in public life act .
and let us continue working together to betterment in this situation , stability and sustainability in our society .
now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs .
this is for children .
now you either have a feeling -- you feel more secure than you are .
so let me complicate things .
because we had different models based on our different experiences .
now it had a name , which made it scarier than the regular flu , even though it was more deadly .
all examples of models changing .
i flew here yesterday .
there wasn &apos;t any real risk , but people were scared .
all these things , they come back to plants .
it means negotiating with heads of state , and with secretaries of state in 50 countries to sign treaties .
these seeds are used for restoration .
couldn &apos;t do it . could not wait .
and it was originally a freight line that ran down 10th ave .
that was enough . it really got the city behind it .
just one quick example is i realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the high line .
after 9 / 11 , either you were with us or against us .
now everybody agrees .
we will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel .
we as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities .
but i &apos;m not thinking &quot; monsteret &quot; is a good thing .
but there &apos;s some amazing opportunities in egypt as well .
now , i &apos;m also very interested in cooking .
is that you ? &quot;
you know .
they don &apos;t have them .
it doesn &apos;t say how things are connected , what causes what and so on .
so this great triumph -- it &apos;s so good , there &apos;s almost a religious experience in biology .
and then one day , i get a call from john doerr , bill berkman and al gore on the same day saying return david agus &apos;s phone call .
so we &apos;re actually measuring each isotope as a different one .
it &apos;s you ; you &apos;re broken .
so david and i applied to this program and created a consortium at usc where we &apos;ve got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world , from cold spring harbor , stanford , austin -- i won &apos;t even go through and name all the places -- to have a research project that will last for five years where we &apos;re really going to try to build a model of cancer like this .
like , &quot; do we like the budweiser commercial ? &quot;
if you can find a way to take the tribes that you &apos;re in and nudge them forward , along these tribal stages to what we call stage five , which is the top of the mountain .
you find them in all places in society .
it is moving from stage three to stage four .
and in this atmosphere , where the only guidance was people &apos;s values and their noble cause , what this group accomplished was historic .
two percent are at stage one .
ted represents a set of values , and as we unite around these values , something really interesting begins to emerge .
you &apos;re hearing one presentation after another , often representing a group of people , a tribe , about how they have changed the world .
the click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life , announcing our entry into every lightless room .
the ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap .
ben katchor : comics of bygone new york
what &apos;s in its universe of attendant virtues ?
matthew &apos;s legs don &apos;t work , and he &apos;ll never walk again , and -- and he does experience this as an &quot; and &quot; rather than a &quot; but &quot; -- and he experiences himself to be healed and whole .
and i &apos;ll never forget hearing that story from dr. rachel naomi remen , who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her , that in the beginning of the creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces .
so in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it &apos;s not .
thank you .
because when it comes to creativity and to leadership , we need introverts doing what they do best .
now in fact , some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts .
so no wilderness , no revelations .
so that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
i spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance i could get .
but occasionally , just occasionally , i hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see , because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry .
and perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech , but if you can imagine the time when this occurred -- it was in the mid &apos; 40s -- this was really , in his view , a pretty piece of high tech .
we always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments , industry , educational institutions , a myriad of other companies and , frankly , even competitors .
because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market , whether it &apos;s education or under-developed nations , either way , it &apos;s a segment that demands incredibly high quality , incredibly high reliability , tremendous low cost and access , and a lot of challenges that frankly , without actually doing it , it would be very difficult to understand , and i &apos;ll explain that in just a minute .
those of you that might be familiar with mexico -- michoacan is a very colorful state .
and on my wedding day , my father came to me again and said , &quot; you know , i &apos;m going to remind you again , that each generation has to do better than the last one .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &quot; but why can &apos;t i figure out my problems ? &quot;
i don &apos;t think -- now , this is a worldview , and i will tell you , everybody &apos;s got a worldview .
when he said the word &quot; species , &quot; he was revealing his worldview .
i know that &apos;s a stereotype . i &apos;ve never met one of them .
so , the good life is not about looking good , feeling good or having the goods ; it &apos;s about being good and doing good .
and then he says , &quot; so that the king &quot; -- he was the king of israel at that time at its apex in power -- &quot; so that the king may care for the widow and orphan , support depressed , defend the defenseless , care for the sick , assist the poor , speak up for the foreigner , those in prison . &quot;
and then god says , &quot; pick it up . &quot;
and he &apos;s saying , &quot; if you lay it down , i &apos;ll make it come alive .
if you &apos;re wired to paint , you paint .
in colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops .
sometimes school is under a tree , or in many cases , the teacher has only a fifth-grade education , so you need a collaborative model of learning , not just building more schools and training more teachers , which you have to do anyway .
but when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs i hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window -- and i can &apos;t actually think of anything i &apos;m wrong about .
so this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
and when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
and my first thought was , &quot; i &apos;ve lost it .
thank you .
this is how you farm oil . and as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved , we started with this brute force approach . and then what did we learn ? then we learned we had to go bigger . and then what &apos;d we learn ? then we have to go even bigger . and we are getting really destructive as we &apos;re going out and farming this bioenergy .
but in the meantime , for the next decade at least , the name of the game is hydrocarbons . and be that oil , be that gas , be that coal , this is what we &apos;re dealing with . and before i make this talk too long , here &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the current energy system .
what counts for vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests .
so as leaders , we understand that intangibles are important , but we don &apos;t have a clue how to measure them .
how many know him ? anybody ?
that &apos;s about it .
what can you start counting today ?
but actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
so armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist ?
what was really exciting about this project was we , and beau , had no idea whether it would work .
all the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old .
please congratulate your children &apos;s team from my side . &quot;
you just need an opportunity . my opportunity came in the form of beau , and the blackawton bee project .
the cheapest products are often the most dangerous .
it &apos;s just the poor people get hit first and worst .
i don &apos;t mean looking at it from that way -- abusing the little species .
can &apos;t love the whole world -- you &apos;ve got to work on trees , or you &apos;ve got to work on immigration .
on the ground , it &apos;s powered electrically .
however , the next 10 years , if like the last 10 years , we &apos;re going to see 30 percent more traffic .
we flew the first vehicle for the international press in 1965 , when i really got it started .
and that sportscar won sports car of the year .
developing the skycar has been a real challenge .
the other thing is , batteries suck too .
and actually , the magnetic fields we &apos;re using are basically about the same as the earth &apos;s magnetic field .
almost immediately , though , people ask , &quot; how small can you make this ? can you make this small enough ? &quot;
so what happens to all these toxins when we die ?
see for me , cultivating the infinity mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet , it &apos;s a step towards accepting the fact that someday i will die and decay .
&quot; i don &apos;t understand . soybeans ?
we always had hope .
terence loved poetry , and the greek poet constantine cavafy is one of my favorite poets .
we sit here -- you know , think about the ground vehicles , the human scale -- what do you see in person ? we need to capture that up close to establish that what it &apos;s like-type experience .
the algae that grow are in a container that distributes the heat to the surrounding water , and you can harvest them and make biofuels and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed , and of course you &apos;d have to make a large area of this , so you &apos;d have to worry about other stakeholders like fishermen and ships and such things , but hey , we &apos;re talking about biofuels , and we know the importance of potentially getting an alternative liquid fuel .
and finally , because it &apos;s an offshore structure , we can think in terms of how it might contribute to an aquaculture activity offshore .
unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water , sequester carbon , and potentially for photovoltaic panels or wave energy or even wind energy , and if you start thinking in terms of integrating all of these different activities , you could also include in such a facility aquaculture .
jonathan trent : energy from floating algae pods
you need also state ownership , especially of land assets , in order to build and roll out infrastructures very quickly .
if you know nothing about china and the soviet union other than the fact about their telephones , you would have made a poor prediction about their economic growth in the next two decades .
but the more natural comparison is actually between india and pakistan .
the whole country went mad .
the good news is , by 2006 , india has closed the gap between men and women in terms of life expectancy .
there are also financial reforms in rural china .
the government has invested in basic education , has invested in basic health .
this was their conjugal bed , in a sense -- ideas would get together there .
so what prestero and his team decided to do is to look around and see : what are the abundant resources in these developing world contexts ?
so , if we &apos;re trying to build organizations that are more innovative , we have to build spaces that -- strangely enough -- look a little bit more like this .
about a decade or two ago , a wonderful scholar named howard gruber went back and looked at darwin &apos;s notebooks from this period .
and they start talking , and one of them says , &quot; hey , has anybody tried to listen for this thing ?
could you figure out an unknown location on the ground , if you knew the location of the satellite ? &quot;
in the 1970s , the one percent accounted for about 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
a lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped under the category of &quot; crony capitalism , &quot; political changes that benefit a group of well-connected insiders but don &apos;t actually do much good for the rest of us .
there are even , and this is my personal favorite example , superstar dentists , the most dazzling exemplar of whom is bernard touati , the frenchman who ministers to the smiles of fellow superstars like russian oligarch roman abramovich or european-born american fashion designer diane von furstenberg .
the middle class is spending more on schooling too , but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at harvard , stanford or mit , the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned by the one percent .
we created the modern welfare state .
i really apologize to everybody for doing that , because obviously , we don &apos;t .
so a colleague of mine from nursing called lisa shaw and i went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die .
it &apos;s an amazing picture .
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t think i look like that anymore , but i had , two of my kids were born at home in the &apos; 80s when home birth was a big thing , and we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation , so if you just replace all these words of birth , i like &quot; peace , love , natural death &quot; as an option .
and when my mother was two years old , the hungarian revolution was raging , and they decided to escape hungary .
and while i was doing this , i was reading the cancer literature , trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field .
tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels .
and again , some of these may be far-fetched , but i figured if there &apos;s anywhere to present far-fetched ideas , it &apos;s here at ted , so thank you very much .
her mother was still alive .
i noticed that at recess , she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team .
so here my friends gene and gail had not heard from me in about a year , and suddenly i was calling , saying &quot; i &apos;m in korea , and i &apos;ve met this extraordinary girl . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , tell him that i was asked by this little girl &apos;s grandmother to find a family for her . &quot;
here i was again , trying to figure out what to do .
and i always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village , they were one of the most respected families in the village .
and this was gene showing the uncle where atlanta was on the map , where he lived .
and now there &apos;s smoke and flames coming by our windows -- we &apos;re on the eleventh floor .
and there &apos;s this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes in all this , and people were shouting in korean .
her great aunt at the airport .
and gail and gene did the complete opposite .
natasha : later , i &apos;ll do that later .
our team , befittingly i think , named it after one of those dreamers of the copernican time , johannes kepler , and that telescope &apos;s sole purpose is to go out , find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy , and tell us how often do planets like our own earth happen to be out there .
in the next 15 years , almost 500 planets were discovered orbiting other stars , with different methods .
because with our own little telescope , just in the next two years , we &apos;ll be able to identify at least 60 of them .
on one hand , on the left bank of the river , are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments .
the biosphere is the size of the earth .
and if we are to be stewards of our planet earth and its biosphere , we &apos;d better understand the cosmic significance and do something about it .
and it has -- the steady state is , more or less , one percent of the adult world population is hiv-infected .
and there &apos;s good studies of the refugees coming out of congo -- they have two , three percent infected , and peaceful zambia -- much higher .
don &apos;t jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on .
and we know that most of it is currently owned by people we might call westerners : europeans , north americans , australasians .
they beat preexisting oriental empires like the mughals and the ottomans .
so let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a scotsman .
the ancestor of the modern corporation , the city of london corporation , existed in the 12th century .
it doesn &apos;t rise any faster after these countries become independent .
in terms of patents , there &apos;s no question that the east is ahead .
and i think these words really nail it : &quot; it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .
mostly they &apos;re worried about each other .
spiders are also extremely old .
they differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color .
in fact , this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length .
and the strength , extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response , have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications , for example , as a component of artificial tendons , for serving as guides to regrow nerves , and for scaffolds for tissue growth .
i didn &apos;t take them . how did i get them ?
you have to exclude some people .
this is a graph of photographs tagged iraq as taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5,445 photos .
and the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone .
in france , a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool , right , because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue .
in the suburbanized , dual-income united states , stay-at-home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local , small-scale neighborhoods .
here &apos;s another example .
and so the point here is not , &quot; this is wonderful , &quot; or &quot; we &apos;re going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooperative framework . &quot;
they become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust .
proofing means to prove that the dough is alive .
i mean , that &apos;s what &apos;s harvest -- we say we harvest the pig , you know ?
and as they &apos;re shaped , they &apos;re raised again , all along proving that they &apos;re alive , and developing character .
batch to batch , crust to crust ... in tribute to the beloved staple food , baking master peter reinhart reflects on the cordial couplings that give us our daily bread . try not to eat a slice .
and the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
they depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
and it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the reverend thomas bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
and sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
ag : now this is his next idea .
so we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
now , before i talk more about that technology , let &apos;s have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games .
so , it &apos;s subject to gravity , has joints , etc .
now , at this stage , it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds .
at the moment , you only have empty computer graphics in games .
so that you don &apos;t have a character that looks limp , but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away , that looks kind of alive in midair as well .
the second thing is video games .
he &apos;s actually a better dancer than i am , i have to say .
shake it again , and you get the british perspective .
you get to try them out , play with them , evaluate them until the novelty wears out , before you have to send them back .
it &apos;s in your tedgift bag . no , no .
they don &apos;t need the database and the website , but they &apos;re like , &quot; well , i &apos;ll upgrade , because , i might , you know , i might need that someday . &quot;
i &apos;m going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent , but it &apos;s better .
you can &apos;t keep a good idea down these days .
i made a fortune over at pixar .
okay , this is not an ideal situation , because it &apos;s getting the echo from the hall and stuff .
we came up with something -- the ten commandments : thou shalt not kill .
and you know , and the troubling thing is that it &apos;s much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things , so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage .
i think the challenge for us is -- i &apos;m very certain that that will happen , the challenge is , will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device ?
and if you make a three-dimensional structure , like a buckyball , they have all sorts of incredible properties .
and so we asked ourselves , you know , can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps ? and brooks told me in a break here , he said he &apos;s found so much stuff he can &apos;t sleep , because there &apos;s so many great technologies out there , we &apos;re essentially buried . and we need them , you know .
and if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly , you can use a more powerful force , a market force , to provide feedback .
until about a dozen years ago , when i was really captured by caves , and i really re-focused most of my research in that direction .
and when it became a landscape , it also became a destination , and altered , really , the course of my life .
the amazing pathfinder mission that went in &apos; 97 , and the mer rover missions that are on mars as we speak now and the european space agency &apos;s mars express , has taught us a number of amazing things .
but the organisms that we work with , from the sub-surface of earth , very often it &apos;s months -- and in many cases , years -- before we see any growth whatsoever .
and yet , everything in this cave has adapted to it .
so , lava-tube caves-- i &apos;ve just told you about organisms that live here on this planet .
now , to wrap this up , i want to talk for two seconds about caves and the human expansion beyond earth as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves .
well , bad news : you should have kept your mouth shut , because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it .
derek sivers : keep your goals to yourself
and it became a world famous manuscript .
so it took four years to take apart .
and this x-ray is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits .
and the important point about this is that it &apos;s the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics .
and if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the web , at the moment you have to go to the national library of y &apos;s site or the university library of x &apos;s site , which is about the most boring way in which you can deal with digital data .
château lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world , the prince of any wine cellar .
white truffles .
and he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light .
i mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet .
and then i got an email from a guy named bipin desai .
now the video games industry is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media .
your ambition is satisfied , but it &apos;s very beautiful .
if we want to engage someone in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies , we want to make sure it &apos;s neither too easy , nor too difficult , to find a pie .
when you get to 13 pies , you &apos;ve got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now . &quot;
this is absolutely crucial , and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this .
this is what really excites us .
and we can use the kind of group behaviors that we see evolving when people are at play together , these really quite unprecedentedly complex cooperative mechanisms .
so to address this problem , i put together a team of international researchers in switzerland , denmark and the u.k .
so i took a job at the united nations world food programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues .
so those seem like two bifurcated problems , but i kind of started to think about , you know , what is obesity and hunger ? what are both those things about ?
not to beat a dead horse , but this is a global food system where there &apos;s a billion people hungry and billion people obese .
and i also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way , where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips .
and we need to start authoring processes again instead of authoring objects .
why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation ?
now , in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable .
in this case what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re taking the orchestra floor , lifting it up , spinning it , changing the rake , taking it back to flat floor , changing the rake again . in essence , you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating , at will .
and last but not least , you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem .
so , first of all , my own stories . these are two of my sketchbooks .
and the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside .
&quot; i can &apos;t wait to see them racing for the first time at daytona next month , because i feel the need for speed . &quot;
so , stories have characters . stories have concepts .
that &apos;s &quot; moby dick . &quot;
and it leads to just a completely different value system .
a 16-year-old quarry worker .
a 37-year-old road worker .
ah , because you know , it &apos;s impermanent .
and one night , i &apos;m riding the uptown local train .
and i looked up , and he &apos;s like , &quot; good to see you , &quot; and i was trying to remember what had happened and trying to get my head around everything , and the pain was just overwhelming , and he said , &quot; you know , we didn &apos;t cut your hair . i thought you might have gotten strength from your hair like samson , and you &apos;re going to need all the strength you can get . &quot;
chris has asked me to do a short performance , and so i &apos;m going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes -- to do that , and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form .
in the third act , we went into bosnia and kosovo and we seemed to succeed .
today , there are 14 health clinics in that area alone .
andrew wilder , for example , born on the pakistan-iranian border , served his whole life in pakistan and afghanistan .
and this is very difficult to do because of our structures .
but that slowness , that caution , the fact that president clinton initially said that american troops would only be deployed for a year , turned out to be a strength , and it helped us to put our priorities right .
and we are always being tempted up to our neck .
what is our approach ?
so , how do you dispose of that ? it &apos;s a problem everywhere .
and so i regard that as done .
but even that &apos;s complicated , because to you , to me , colors might indicate &quot; normal , &quot; but , after all , we &apos;re all suffering from probably an excess of education .
and the fluid will flow from one layer into the next .
it costs 50 dollars . we can probably make it for 50 cents , if we put our mind to it .
but there is also this part of the country , kind of in the middle region here .
here is the same data on a map .
so what we &apos;re going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or , really , some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors .
you have real neighborhoods and real trees , and real streets you can walk on .
but i &apos;d like to make the case to you in the next 17 minutes that when we shortcut the physical exam , when we lean towards ordering tests instead of talking to and examining the patient , we not only overlook simple diagnoses that can be diagnosed at a treatable , early stage , but we &apos;re losing much more than that .
and therefore , she took a short cut down inverleith row to arrive here .
i &apos;ve often wondered , what would fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era , in the year 2011 ?
i was very influenced by that anecdote .
i took this to my colleagues at stanford in anthropology and told them the same story .
although , god knows , of late , in our hubris , we seem to have drifted away .
people remember the hits ; they forget the misses .
i think you need to be more explicit here in step two . &quot;
and it wasn &apos;t solved until 1655 .
or if geologists were elephants ?
there &apos;s a reversespeech.com web page from which i downloaded this stuff .
i was a member of the astronomy club , and i should have known better . &quot;
four million of these babies die annually .
you can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it &apos;s able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time , after which you simply reheat the pouch .
but what do we do for a living ?
if necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff .
but they always stop and take a picture .
and not everyone will . but you don &apos;t need everyone .
and i hope you &apos;ll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand .
essentially first , the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers at high levels in the bloodstream in the earliest stages , but also only in cancer .
one professor even went through my entire procedure , painstakingly -- i &apos;m not really sure where he got all this time -- and he went through and said why each and every step was like the worst mistake i could ever make .
thank you .
that , by the way is haifa wehbe . she &apos;s a lebanese pop star and pan-arab pin-up girl .
so , why does good sex so often fade , even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever ?
give me comfort , give me edge .
and across culture , across religion , and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back .
what parts of you are just being seen ?
and those who didn &apos;t die lived often very tethered to the ground , could not experience pleasure , could not trust , because when you &apos;re vigilant , worried , anxious , and insecure , you can &apos;t lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative .
but if on this side there is somebody who says , &quot; i &apos;m worried . i &apos;m anxious . i &apos;m depressed .
it &apos;s about you create a space where you leave management inc . , maybe where you leave the agile program , and you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible .
the clientele behavior was very much the same too .
this is the room that bach wrote some of his music for . this is the organ .
and they &apos;re a lot more reverberant than la scala .
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music .
they did the best they could given that this is what they &apos;re writing for .
other birds , like this tanager , have adapted within the same species .
and i was so stimulated .
where does it come from ?
the problem is the person or persons using it .
but tonight , i &apos;ve got some notes here so that if i begin to forget , which i do sometimes , i &apos;ve got something i can turn to .
in one of his plays , alexander solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying , who says to those gathered around his bed , &quot; the moment when it &apos;s terrible to feel regret is when one is dying . &quot;
i couldn &apos;t prove it .
what &apos;s up ted people ? let me hear you make some noise .
before form i was storm , blind , ign &apos;ant -- still am .
and in libby , montana , there &apos;s a rather unusual woman named gayla benefield .
but she was really amazed .
you could see willful blindness in the run-up to the iraq war .
and yet , when i talk to whistleblowers , the recurrent tone that i hear is pride .
1998 : a single mother of four , three months after the birth of my fourth child , i went to do a job as a research assistant .
2010 : a young woman stands before president sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together , their father and mother died during the war .
and some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps , as young mothers , to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women .
will you journey with me to help that girl , be it an african girl or an american girl or a japanese girl , fulfill her wish , fulfill her dream , achieve that dream ?
they were able to mobilize young women .
we &apos;ve been paying a lot of attention to marvin minsky &apos;s vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years .
it displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called &quot; meaningful adjacency . &quot;
and so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters , catching the cleverest is the difference between success and failure .
the vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom -- hugely important , since between 2003 and 2007 , iraq had 1,382 suicide bombings , a major source of instability .
now that was the advice that st. benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century .
and it went like this : wake up well rested after a good night &apos;s sleep .
it &apos;s totally dominated by work .
with the smallest investment in the right places , you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life .
these land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity , diabetes and asthma .
many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding .
think bike shops , juice stands .
neither the destruction of the ninth ward nor the south bronx was inevitable .
fellow tedsters bill mcdonough and amory lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that .
listen -- when i spoke to mr. gore the other day after breakfast , i asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy .
and this is what happens .
so this is what happens in the world , if we play the entire world .
about 1957 here , the health of the united states is the same as the philippines .
and this is the same thing , money down there , and health , you know ?
this is 1962 , and united states was emitting 16 tons per person .
and we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street , and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day .
this is one of the best agronomists in malawi , junatambe kumbira , and he &apos;s discussing what sort of cassava they will plant -- the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found .
but my neighbor only knows two types of countries -- industrialized and developing .
we are not interested in money .
can i request a moment of absolute silence ?
real quickly -- michelangelo once said he &apos;s there to &quot; discover the figure within , &quot; ok ?
we &apos;re dealing with irrationalisms , and we &apos;re dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist , and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four , and if you get 4.0 it &apos;s better , and 4.000 is even better .
you &apos;ve got to do cars in the rain ; you &apos;ve got to do cars in the snow .
so people get wrapped up in it . and we took a team of designers , and we sent them off to america . and we gave them a budget , what we thought was a set of deliverables , a timetable , and nothing else .
and so i had these ideas in my head , that this is going to be great .
and somebody asked me about catherine , my wife , you know , did she fly out with me or something ?
american designer chris bangle explains his philosophy that car design is an art form in its own right , with an entertaining -- and ultimately moving -- account of the bmw group &apos;s deep blue project , intended to create the suv of the future .
but what it means is that we fail to identify a greasy pocket in these proteins , into which we , like molecular locksmiths , can fashion an active , small , organic molecule or drug substance .
they were changing shape .
we basically tried to create the most competitive environment for our lab as possible .
yet this information is largely a secret .
what that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were closer together .
boltzmann gave us a formula -- engraved on his tombstone now -- that really quantifies what entropy is .
so that &apos;s our job .
meanwhile , for all intents and purposes , space looks finite to us .
but if you &apos;re boltzmann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations .
even if you left our galaxy out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies .
why aren &apos;t we in empty space ?
sean carroll : distant time and the hint of a multiverse
we drop down to nothing .
i had never slept in a hotel .
what i got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars .
so i put a small camera over there , that acts as a digital eye .
and many of you are excited about the next generation tablet computers to come out in the market .
this technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way with maybe a speaker system . &quot;
and now , ladies and gentlemen , the envelope containing the result .
so every time you see a concrete jungle like that , what you &apos;ve got to do is find open spaces .
a kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway .
rio has the aim , by 2020 , to have all its favelas completely urbanized .
ep : okay , how &apos;s the traffic ?
now this is an extremely complicated subject , in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different .
now , i personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty , with its emotional intensity and pleasure , belongs to our evolved human psychology .
the trees , by the way , are often preferred if they fork near the ground , that is to say , if they &apos;re trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix .
so what were these ancient -- i mean , they &apos;re ancient , they &apos;re foreign , but they &apos;re at the same time somehow familiar .
and what i &apos;ve spent 15 years doing in this business -- and it &apos;s taken me almost 14 to figure it out -- is i think about the future of wars in the context of everything else .
the united states has to access that battle space instantaneously .
who do you access in this transition space ?
the problem is he doesn &apos;t exist .
that gets you 250,000 dead in the sudan in the last 15 months .
why ? because they just got fed up .
the berlin wall falls . we do desert storm .
can you come back next year and remind us again ? &quot;
to attack america is to risk blowing up the world .
switching back , morning , afternoon , evening , morning , afternoon , evening .

read max boon .
no off season , these guys are always active .
hello , my name is dennis hong , and we &apos;re bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired .
and we also use three laser range finders .
so think of it as a monitor for the blind .
letters thanking us , but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one : &quot; now i understand why there is braille on a drive-up atm machine . &quot;
i looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
i &apos;ve got a plastic fork , don &apos;t you know ? &quot;
as peter levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
and i &apos;m interested in searching for life in the universe .
so they would have to have something like a reptilian skin .
and the further out you go in this , away from the sun , the more powerful this reflection will be . so actually , this method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger as you go further away , because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light shines out even more in contrast against the dark background .
what i remember today from this is that objects tell stories , so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work .
but i really was looking for creating a unique experience of light , a new experience of light .
the bottles connect together , and you can create different shapes , different forms .
so , the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible .
and we released to youtube this , the virtual choir project , 185 singers from 12 different countries .
what intrigues me most is how women are doing this , despite a set of paradoxes that are both frustrating and fascinating .
her daughter , rani , a few years older than me , sat in her lap bewildered , not knowing what had happened to the confident woman she once knew as her mother .
she is also immensely pragmatic .
as leah , one of the founders of the group , says , &quot; i like traditional music very much .
&quot; what does it matter ? &quot; they said , &quot; a bullet doesn &apos;t distinguish between a muslim and a christian . &quot;
the protests , the marches , the uncompromising position that women &apos;s rights are human rights , full stop .
thank you .
we still clutch close these letters to our chest , to the words that speak louder than loud , when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say , the words that we have needed to write , to sisters and brothers and even to strangers , for far too long .
say a new super bug has emerged .
because the kaaba and the rituals around it are relics from the earliest phase of islam , that of prophet muhammad .
so what might look like a problem within islamic faith might turn out to be a tradition that muslims have subscribed to .
but we can change how it was interpreted , because it was interpreted according to the time and milieu in the middle ages .
and actually you don &apos;t need to be a rocket scientist to understand that .
they said that &quot; we want freedom ; we want democracy .
so what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the golgi stain .
and only much later did scientists come onto the scene and say , &quot; hey , these are tools , these are functions that we could use in our own research tool palette . &quot;
but this trend is less unambiguous .
but let &apos;s look at the good news again .
unresolved boundary issues , squabbles over oil revenues , the ongoing conflict in darfur , escalating tribal violence in the south and generally weak state capacity across all of sudan complete a very depressing picture of the state of affairs in africa &apos;s largest country .
conflict parties also need to be prepared to return to the negotiation table if the agreement implementation stalls .
our journey starts in space , where matter condenses into spheres over time ...
vision was refined in horseshoe crabs , among the first to leave the sea .
plants began to diversify and grew , turning into trees .
primates emerge from jungles , as tarsiers first , becoming lemurs not much later .
pretty much in every case , that &apos;s how a charity starts .
it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought , we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that i could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level .
our ribbon is a hairy ribbon .
so those conversations , getting men engaged in this , at whatever age , is so critically important , and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise .
benki knew this .
and what am i doing ? &quot;
my work has taken me around the world , where i &apos;ve had the real privilege of meeting people like benki and many others who are making change happen in their communities -- people who see the world differently , who are asking different questions , who have different answers , who understand the filters that they wear when they go out into the world .
but he saw the work , the care , the compassion that sanghamitra and her team brought to the village , and he wanted to be part of it .
this building contains the world &apos;s largest collection of documents and artifacts commemorating the u.s. role in fighting on the chinese side in that long war -- the flying tigers .
but the good news is that we don &apos;t have to figure it out as we go along ; we have models , we have examples , like benki and sanghamitra and jianchuan .
alexander asked , &quot; what are you doing ? &quot;
you go again and again and again .
you see , indian music , for example , does not have the concept of harmony .
he knew that institutional thinking doesn &apos;t work in india . individual thinking does .
you will discover that within infinite myths lies the eternal truth .
you know what ? here &apos;s a little secret .
yes , there was a little kid wandering through this building when i came here , and no , i didn &apos;t kick him .
larry smith : why you will fail to have a great career
but in my view , the radiologists are heroes .
there have been surprisingly few innovations , until digital mammography was approved in 2000 .
but the potential advantage was that gamma rays , unlike x-rays , are not influenced by breast density .
after we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors , we used these images to submit a grant to the susan g. komen foundation .
if this technology is widely adopted , i will not benefit financially in any way , and that is very important to me , because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth .
we can and must do better , not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters , but in time for you .
when you come to my website , i actually know what you &apos;re going to do already because i &apos;ve seen you visit millions of websites before .
android .
or maybe we punt -- ask the legal department , see what they say .
there are truths about two .
he thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here-and-now using our best judgment to find the right path .
but maybe you don &apos;t feel that way either .
we &apos;re the ones who have to do it .
find an artist or a writer -- or , heaven forbid , find a philosopher and talk to them .
we determine how this will all end .
but i didn &apos;t want it to make it by isolating people , without any earmuffs or those kind of things .
this object is completely covered by fiber opticals .
and it means , right , you are in the recovery .
so it uses some plants to do this job , selected for their gas-filtering ability .
because you can grow some potatoes .
secondly , i want to tell you how somebody like me came to be able to see the inner workings of a gang .
it was a brilliant way of getting the brain high .
now , sudhir was lucky .
they are the entrepreneurs .
it goes back to , you know , the real-real versus the fake-real .
&amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; freakonomics &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ; author steven levitt presents new data on the finances of drug dealing . contrary to popular myth , he says , being a street-corner crack dealer isn &apos;t lucrative : it pays below minimum wage . and your boss can kill you .
in 2008 i jumped the eiffel tower in paris .
that &apos;s reason number one . and reason number two : it &apos;s much easier for the camera guy to film if i &apos;m using smoke .
the show was , in a sense , about that .
and the water flows through the city with time .
the big mountains far away , they move less .
of course the political agendas in the world has been very obsessed , polarizing the two against each other into different , very normative ideas .
i spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean , one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away .
ew : the full monty .
and this book was one of the most famous books in america for about 35 years .
he became a jesuit .
natalie merchant sings from her new album , &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; leave your sleep . &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; lyrics from near-forgotten 19th-century poetry pair with her unmistakable voice for a performance that brought the audience to its feet .

forty years ago , bob kahn and i did the design of the internet .
it &apos;s operating on the international space station .
i know you mentioned that a keyboard is a really key part of this .
it &apos;s like , on facebook , you have friends only from -- it &apos;s like your neighbors are your friends on facebook .
so . and now it &apos;s communication .
look at this one . this is the iran-loves-israel page .
maybe as people , because especially in israel , we &apos;re in a democracy . we have the freedom of speech , and maybe that little thing can change something .
in fact , i actually think that darwin is one of the people who best explains our design process .
we scaled the building up three times to chinese proportions , and went to china .
copenhagen , shanghai , modern , european .
so , when it came out in denmark that we were actually going to move our national monument , the national people &apos;s party sort of rebelled against it .
and all the rainwater that drops on the mountain is actually accumulated .
what i &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
and that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated .
we &apos;d like to know these things .
then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
and that is really why it becomes a bad project .
but in a world where we don &apos;t do either , or don &apos;t do it very well , we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first .
so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight .
so we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
so we trained them to be able to do three separate words , to lay out them properly .
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons , it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more dennises becoming dentists and there are more paulas who are married to paul than statistically viable .
using simple , delightful illustrations , designer stefan sagmeister shares his latest thinking on happiness -- both the conscious and unconscious kind . his seven rules for life and design happiness can apply to everyone seeking more joy .
so the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea .
and in fact , we could make it from a waste stream -- so for example , a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant .
in the ongoing debate about globalization , what &apos;s been missing is the voices of the workers themselves .
what a factory makes is never the point , and the workers could not care less who buys their products .
they weren &apos;t exactly worthless , but they were nothing close to the actual value , because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one , or knew how much it was worth .
thank you , leslie , that was an insight that a lot of us haven &apos;t had before .
the taliban now run their own schools .
step three : the taliban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in .
soc : what blessing would you get from carrying out a suicide attack ?
you can smell them . you can get a feel for them .
they say , &quot; of course not , the internet doesn &apos;t weigh anything . &quot;
and tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables , one across the atlantic and one across the pacific , and proceeded to add pieces onto them , until they had built a belt around the world , which means they will send your bits to the east or the west .
thank you .
it sounds great .
so it &apos;s overall performance and efficiency just exceeds standard mass produced products .
it &apos;s all over the web .
using this process , pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today .
she started off by telling me her dream . she said , &quot; i had two .
and so with patient capital from acumen and other organizations , loans and investments that will go the long term with them , they built a low-cost housing development , about an hour outside nairobi central .
there &apos;s a few things i learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
when i gave up sugar for 30 days , day 31 looked like this .
maybe we could make energy .
so what you see here is 12 separate petals , that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors that would only cost a dollar .
and that &apos;s the process we took -- let me show you how the engine works .
and at less than a five-year payback , all of a sudden this becomes very economic so you don &apos;t have to just want to have a feel-good attitude about energy to want to have one of these .
but still , we look at the pieces .
rachel pike : the science behind a climate headline
that to be able to talk about content , to break apart what you normally expect , to use humor and surprise , elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us .
i was fortunate also , to meet the man who &apos;s sitting on the bed , though i gave him hair over here and he doesn &apos;t have hair .
e.b. white wrote us a number of rules , which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him for the rest of time , or you can ignore them , which i do , or you can , i don &apos;t know what , you know , eat a sandwich .
and then i want to tell you that this is a map .
how do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories , you know , are real sentences ?
and then i photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street .
and immediately , a lot of different responsibilities , in terms of my education and so forth , were heaped upon me .
what we saw in the destruction of the bamiyan buddhas was the depletion of matter , some solid substance falling down and disintegrating .
so let &apos;s try to look at it from a different perspective .
our big concern at the moment is a virus called h5n1 flu -- some of you call it bird flu -- which first emerged in southern china , in the mid-1990s , but we didn &apos;t know about it until 1997 .
so it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive .
let &apos;s pretend there &apos;s a pandemic .
what about quarantine ?
you &apos;ll end up buying -- this is called an n95 mask . ridiculous .
the second wave was the mutated , super-killer wave .
everybody has come up to me and said , well i &apos;ll stockpile water or , i &apos;ll stockpile food , or what have you .
to say ahh , if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic ?
lg : um yeah . so we don &apos;t actually know what the lethality was of the 1918 strain to wild birds before it jumped from birds to humans .
and yes they die , drowning in their own fluids , of pneumonia .
so next time you think about a vehicle , i hope , like us , you &apos;re thinking about something new .
two months later , six years old , i &apos;m able to do one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
he said , &quot; philippe , you have been had .
shall i ever so slightly shift my weight to the left ?
it will go perfectly on the day of the walk .
and whenever he &apos;s daunted by an impossible situation to solve in this hard-to-manage city , instead of giving up , he looks at the picture and he says , &quot; if philippe can do that , i can do this , &quot; and he goes back to work .
but rather , it is their leaves that are adapted to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog .
scenes of forest destruction , forest harvesting and forest fragmentation , thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has when it is not disturbed by humans .
we &apos;ve had dance people up in the canopy .
they were very enthusiastic .
a unique ecosystem of plants , birds and monkeys thrives in the treetops of the rainforest . nalini nadkarni explores these canopy worlds -- and shares her findings with the world below , through dance , art and bold partnerships .
what they hadn &apos;t counted on was digitization , because that meant that all those paper receipts had been scanned in electronically , and it was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database , put it on a disk , and then just saunter outside of parliament , which they did , and then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder , which was the daily telegraph , and then , you all remember , there was weeks and weeks of revelations , everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off .
and how is it possible that the volume of information can be processed that needs to in this system ?
so i can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak . it was amazing . i mean , it was amazing .
there was no evidence . he presented no evidence of that .
and so , it was really exciting to me to have this moment in time , it really set the course for the rest of my life .
and of course , if you were to down to where there &apos;s 15 times as much -- the deeper you go , the more exacerbating the problem becomes .
this picture was taken 300 feet deep , catching new species of fish .
in our applications , we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply , because it &apos;s a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen .
there &apos;s a just-unbelievable diversity .
now , i don &apos;t know if any of you get u.s. news and world report -- i got the recent issue .
now , if you go to an amazon jungle and fog a tree , you may get a lot of bugs , but for fishes , there &apos;s nowhere in the world you can get seven new species per hour of time .
when i was 10 years old , a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school .
it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic .
and in making this film i felt that so many of the documentaries i &apos;ve seen were all about learning something , or knowledge , or driven by talking heads , and driven by ideas .
richard saul wurman : i remember hearing him talk at penn .
your father , is he alive ?
the story of humans is the story of ideas -- scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners , ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally , ideas for which we &apos;ve lived and died and killed and been killed , ideas that have vanished in history , and ideas that have been set in dogma .
our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances , and theirs might be as well .
and the nearest star is 4.2 light years away , which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here .
so this &quot; ascent &quot; of man , pinnacle of evolution , has got to go .
2009 is the 400th anniversary of galileo &apos;s first use of the telescope , darwin &apos;s 200th birthday , the 150th anniversary of the publication of &quot; on the origin of species , &quot; the 50th anniversary of seti as a science , the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the seti institute as a non-profit , and of course , the 25th anniversary of ted .
we &apos;ve seen what happens when we divide an already small planet into smaller islands .
their entire camp , every item of gear , was ferried 885 miles from mcmurdo station , the main u.s. supply base on the coast of antarctica .
don &apos;t we already know how they affect temperatures ?
the old story about climate protection is that it &apos;s costly , or it would have been done already .
on the competitiveness front , we all know that toyota has more market cap than the big three put together .
and these policies work fine without taxes , subsidies or mandates .
for example , we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods .
or we could , of course , just get this little bit by continuing to import some canadian and mexican oil , or the ethanol the brazilians would love to sell us .
just turn it over to the private sector , and we have an internet .
i met with david to talk about what i might do in his company .
we launched a website on september 2nd that has now served 25 million pages , and has 42,000 registered young girl users .
girl 7 : i run track , i played soccer , i play basketball , and i love a lot of things to do .
we can , for example , go find miko &apos;s locker and get some more information about her .
van meegeren was charged with the crime of treason , which is itself punishable by death .
i &apos;m a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much ?
it &apos;s not just that you say it &apos;s more pleasurable , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way .
according to an unconfirmed report , a saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars for this pair of shoes .
the interesting thing about marla olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program 60 minutes ii into their house to film her painting .
and they gave them a series of painful electric shocks .
so already you can see there are contradictions .
from somewhere in america .
but that &apos;s because people who eat fruit and veg and olive oil , they &apos;re freaks , they &apos;re not normal , they &apos;re like you ; they come to events like this .
the placebo effect is one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine .
and it &apos;s a foregone conclusion , if you give a drug at that high a dose , that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better .
this is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias in studies of publication bias .
we prescribe these drugs , we stockpile them for emergencies on the understanding that they will reduce the number of complications , which means pneumonia and which means death .
i say , &quot; how &apos;s it possible that we could be so poor here in the united states , because the coal is such a wealthy resource , it &apos;s so much money ? &quot;
you &apos;re arab muslim living in iraq .
these people have designs for your resource , and this is what you see ?
their bibles have a little insignia that says &quot; u.s. army &quot; on them .
that &apos;s what this is about .
for you , this is like all christians .
so we &apos;re all back home .
it shouldn &apos;t be that difficult .
step inside of the tiny , little world of somebody else .
today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons ; it can be manned with a smaller crew ; and unloaded faster than ever before .
more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge .
for the hollywood people in the audience , this even explains why action movies have larger budgets than comedies : it &apos;s because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures , so the market for those movies is larger .
we will see an einstein in africa in this century .
alright what about problems ?
now the united states has a particularly important role to play in this : to keep our education system globalized , to keep our education system open to students from all over the world , because our education system is the candle that other students come to light their own candles .
the great majority of organisms on earth remain unknown to science .
the viruses , those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages , the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria , are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology , a world unto themselves .
the human juggernaut is permanently eroding earth &apos;s ancient biosphere by a combination of forces that can be summarized by the acronym &quot; hippo , &quot; the animal hippo .
i wish we will work together to help create the key tools that we need to inspire preservation of earth &apos;s biodiversity .
but it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades .
so he and ryan organized and hosted a meeting at the wyss institute in harvard bringing together specialists on passenger pigeons , conservation ornithologists , bioethicists , and fortunately passenger pigeon dna had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist named beth shapiro .
de-extinction falls in that category .
the sequence of events : he &apos;ll put together the genomes of the band-tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon , he &apos;ll take the techniques of george church and get passenger pigeon dna , the techniques of robert lanza and michael mcgrew , get that dna into chicken gonads , and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs , squabs , and now you &apos;re getting a population of passenger pigeons .
these have been private meetings so far .
throughout humankind &apos;s history , we &apos;ve driven species after species extinct : the passenger pigeon , the eastern cougar , the dodo ... but now , says stewart brand , we have the technology to bring back species that humanity wiped out . so -- should we ? which ones ? he asks a big question whose answer is closer than you may think .
when i was in the third grade , i wrote a book for the first time , &quot; the owl who thought he was the best flyer . &quot;
so how did i make friends ?
and on the day i met my father for the first time , i was rejected from the rhode island school of design , my one and only choice for college .
for a two-year-old , that is like a tattoo .
it &apos;s time to start designing for our ears .
education .
then you have children for whom english is a second language , or whatever they &apos;re being taught in is a second language .
we have urban planners .
our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique .
and i think the reason why is that i was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another .
thank you .
in low-fat butter , or actually in many low-fat products , when you take the fat out , you actually take the taste and the texture out .
it &apos;s actually a very low-tech and very high-tech product at the same time .
well , i said to her , &quot; you know , kids don &apos;t learn from people they don &apos;t like . &quot;
you got two right . you didn &apos;t miss them all . &quot;
they &apos;re now working on their ninth edition , which they began in 1930 , and they &apos;ve reached the letter p .
you can say , &quot; sal gave jason a headache , &quot; but it &apos;s a bit odd to say , &quot; sal gave a headache to jason . &quot;
it &apos;s exactly the same construction , but no muffins , no mice , nothing moving at all .
so the puzzle is , why are bribes , polite requests , solicitations and threats so often veiled ?
if you express your request as a conditional -- &quot; if you could open the window , that would be great &quot; -- even though the content is an imperative , the fact that you &apos;re not using the imperative voice means that you &apos;re not acting as if you &apos;re in a relationship of dominance , where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person .
and i &apos;m not just an academic , i &apos;m a philosopher , so i like to think that i &apos;m actually pretty good at arguing .
here &apos;s my argument . does it work ? is it any good ?
i think those are deforming effects , and worst of all , it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation or compromise or collaboration .
the war metaphor forces us into thinking that you &apos;re the winner and i lost , even though i gained .
it takes practice to become a good arguer in the sense of being able to benefit from losing , but fortunately , i &apos;ve had many , many colleagues who have been willing to step up and provide that practice for me .
we use bacteria to clean our water . and we said , well , that &apos;s not exactly being inspired by nature .
what had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their careers trying to solve .
that &apos;s a geranium pollen .
and so silicon , which we make right now -- it &apos;s part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips -- this is a bio-mineralization process that &apos;s now being mimicked .
see that up-close picture ?
a guy named bruce rosner looked at the tardigrade -- which dries out completely , and yet stays alive for months and months and months , and is able to regenerate itself .
we should be growing fertility . and , oh yes -- we get food , too .
and i saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling .
by the time we met , she had 20 employees , most of them women , who were sending their boys and their girls to school .
those in small businesses can &apos;t get the capital they need to expand and those in microbusiness can &apos;t grow out of them .
secondly , when we talk about men who are succeeding , we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated .
once upon a time in 19th century germany , there was the book .
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty .
now , the average house has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it ; this is the energy it takes to make it -- millions and millions of paper towels .
clearly , i need to walk home from ted .
so , i thought , let &apos;s build something that &apos;s mutually beneficial .
no one taught her to bend this into a hook , had shown her how it could happen .
so what &apos;s significant about this isn &apos;t that crows are using cars to crack nuts .
and we move to the third stage , where we only give them a coin .
thanks very much .
so i &apos;m going to talk to the baby . so i say to the baby , holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof , i say to the baby , &apos; sir or madam , what is your considered opinion of the human species ? &apos; and the baby looks , you know , the way babies look at you clearly , starts laughing , starts busting out with this crazy little laugh .
and this is an inmate named paulette jenkins .
so what she &apos;s questioning here , she &apos;s taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society .
it seems like he has so much bad luck , you know .
so it is a one-company town .
but wait , the good news is it &apos;s at least better than meth labs and gonorrhea .
in fact , if you look just at the upper and northern states in the west , they could do geothermal , or you could look at texas and say , we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid .
jennifer granholm : a clean energy proposal -- race to the top !
and we can lie about our age online , too , pretty easily .
will the next big-budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks ?
they listen and mimic and remix what they like .
space is length and breadth continued indefinitely , but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in america because countries are beginning to eat like us , live like us and die like us .
and over here we have , in the words of radiologist israel meisner , &quot; the hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements . &quot;
now this is somebody who is brain-dead , legally dead , definitely checked out , but is being kept alive on a respirator , so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation .
i love this article because at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation .
this one said , &quot; yield : one ejaculate . &quot;
she said , &quot; it was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva .
it wasn &apos;t spurted or thrown or ejected under great force .
but after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide , and sitting last year at tedactive , i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help .
but not to worry .
yeah , i kind of felt sorry for him .
ja , well i could have translated that , but you would have been none the wiser .
you know , there is a -- i &apos;m always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this .
i mean , it &apos;s &quot; the future we will create . &quot;
dad helped design the control panels for the ibm 360 computer .
but ever since then , the wheelchair has been a given in my life .
no ! they &apos;re not for safety .
it &apos;s what we &apos;re supposed to do somehow .
he &apos;s like our other children , but the experience is completely different .
human life needed a reason .
and all of a sudden , from around a corner , comes this young man , paralyzed , just like me , in this metal and wood and leather pedal , three-wheel tricycle-wheelchair device , and he pedals up to me as fast as he can .
you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
this is at the korean advanced institute of science and technology .
this is one of our robots that we showed at wired nextfest a couple of years ago .
six percent for heart disease , seven percent for type 2 diabetes , which is what my father died of .
because if you think about it , 1,000 tedtalks , that &apos;s over 1,000 ideas worth spreading .
so here are some of the results that i received . i think they &apos;re quite nice .
there were others , and i found this quite cheeky .
so i had 50 overall summaries done .
similarly , the astronomers &apos; results are surely well-deserving of the nobel prize , but they raised an analogous question .
but string theory says that , on fantastically small scales , there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them .
an early example comes from the great astronomer johannes kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number -- why the sun is 93 million miles away from the earth .
well let me describe one way that might one day happen .
so on the one hand , it &apos;s just incredible where we &apos;ve gotten , but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future .
and you &apos;re able to interact with his world .
milo : i wonder how deep it is .
he &apos;s just moved house . he &apos;s got no friends .
it stops .
it was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war , humanitarian aid workers , and of course the brave and courageous people of sarajevo themselves .
and that &apos;s pretty much why i do it .
thank you very much .
the idea is , let &apos;s have some sensors that listen to these storms , this electrical firing , and see if you can , in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal -- about half a second -- let &apos;s see if we can read these signals , extract the motor messages that are embedded in it , translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time .
and aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm , but she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases .
and that &apos;s a picture that every neurophysiologist knows .
this is a nonprofit consortium called the walk again project that is putting together scientists from europe , from here in the united states , and in brazil together to work to actually get this new body built -- a body that we believe , through the same plastic mechanisms that allow aurora and other monkeys to use these tools through a brain-machine interface and that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life .
why would we waste this money on you ? &quot;
the cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender .
there are three reasons why this is the case .
now , modern slavery : according to state department rough statistics , there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number -- that are trafficked across international borders .
and the next morning , she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary , she would be saved .
he does the transportation and distribution , and she does the production and sourcing .
look : u.s. aid , helping people is not easy , and there have been books that have criticized u.s. aid .
she was in her grandmother &apos;s backyard , and she saw something that made her break down in tears .
now all this fuss about a single one of our traits tells us there &apos;s something worth explaining .
now to many commentators , cumulative cultural adaptation , or social learning , is job done , end of story .
now you pursue this guy , gesticulating .
if we go to the island of papua new guinea , we can find about 800 to 1,000 distinct human languages , different human languages , spoken on that island alone .
and that question is whether in this modern , globalized world we can really afford to have all these different languages .
that people have just sort of figured out about it , and now with kyoto and the governator and people beginning to actually do something , we may be on the road to a solution .
but one of the reasons it &apos;s politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers .
another thing you might wonder about is , does it work ?
the big deal was he happened to have won the nobel prize for ozone chemistry .
finally , we could make the particles migrate to over the poles , so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles .
because sooner or later , we &apos;ll be confronted with decisions about this , and it &apos;s better if we think hard about it , even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it .
that &apos;s an absolutely possible scenario .
and i think it really summarizes where we are here .
so i create these two poles .
and in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene .
he has since passed away , but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities .
but through exposure to composite sketches , polaroids , mug shots and line-ups , eyewitness testimony can change .
he is photographed at his alibi location .
before that time , people are left to their own devices .
now , i wasn &apos;t just obsessed . i was outraged .
so what you &apos;re looking at right now is the earth .
i &apos;m going to double-click on uranus , and we can see uranus rotating on its side along with its moons .
it actually flies underneath saturn .
it was clean , efficient , there was no high , there was really no danger , it had no street value .
we have a system that is really ancient , and really there for physical danger .
we don &apos;t seem to have a word for that .
dopamine system , the wanting system , is much more centralized .
these are not the periods when you feel happiest .
what happens when people pursue money too avidly , is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life .
i had all kinds of rats , mice , hamsters , gerbils , squirrels .
very , very simple .
moreover , this small team together with , of course , you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up .
an animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent , so it goes extremely fast .
to conclude , i would actually like to say , you may think this is about rats , these projects , but in the end it is about people .
these are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time .
but the same neuron , in some cases , will fire when i simply watch another person being touched .
hetain patel : yuyu rau : hi , i &apos;m hetain . i &apos;m an artist .
i have been wondering recently , if he were alive today , what advice he would give me about making this ted talk .
he then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct , and that i had learned it very well , but in a woman &apos;s voice .
that little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube , and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another morina flower , just on the right species , what happens ?
now , all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain and tell what species it came from , and that &apos;s actually quite handy if you maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from .
since 1984 , more women die in the u.s. than men .
she had to look like a man .
when we watch people become obese , where do men get fat ?
and when you have female-pattern and you look like a woman , as barbara does here with her husband , they don &apos;t get the treatment .
and in fact , it probably won &apos;t .
what does that even mean ?
but what &apos;s really amazing is that the cells , when we electrically stimulate them , like with a pacemaker , that they beat so much more .
and we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system .
baby : gagagagagaga gaga gaga gaga guga guga guga wada gaga gaga guga gaga wader guga guga water water water water water water water water water .
what i &apos;m going to do is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes , again , of just life in the living room .
and we &apos;re now zoomed in over the entrance to the house .
and if you put them on one plain , a second plain is where the content lives .
and i think the implications here are profound , whether it &apos;s for science , for commerce , for government , or perhaps most of all , for us as individuals .
and the consensus was : it really worked .
and then the limbic system is activated when we see motion , when we see color , and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors that we &apos;ve heard about before .
it was all just gone .
it looks a little phallic , but after all , it &apos;s a bathroom .
this light up here is the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in america .
however , if we took a small hammer , and we added cracks to all the other windows , then we have a pattern .
the third thing is arguably -- the industrial revolution started in the renaissance with the rise of humanism , then got a little jump-start along about the french revolution .
the fifth thing is that maybe , after 2,500 years , plato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms .
&quot; woo . woohooo . &quot;
that exacerbates and continues this model .
if failure destroys you , then you can &apos;t do this .
we &apos;re less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in los angeles , called cedars-sinai .
because it &apos;s the first thing we draw ; we surround ourselves with images of it ; it &apos;s probably the most common image on the planet .
this is a dense array eeg mri tracking 156 channels of information .
i thought there were miraculous elements , but i also didn &apos;t think it was right that one should have to struggle and search for answers when this is a pandemic within our society .
and here &apos;s another person in , call it , high school and college .
this is a level of pain that &apos;s only known to other people who suffer vascular migraines .
i don &apos;t have the ability to control my left foot .
when i press it again , it &apos;ll chirp three times , and that &apos;ll mean that it &apos;s armed and ready to go .
simon lewis : don &apos;t take consciousness for granted
or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here ?
of course it &apos;s a logarithmic scale here , but our concept of economy is growth with percent . we look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase . if i change this , and i take gdp per capita instead of family income , and i turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product , and i take the regions down here , the size of the bubble is still the population .
and if we move back again , here , and we put on trails on them , like this , you can see again that the speed of development is very , very different , and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health , but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first .
he only says , &quot; we can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and then , i hope maybe i have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now .
and -- but then i went to a meeting in italy .
the people from london came up .
well , i said , linus was wrong and that we &apos;re still in the game and that they should immediately start building models .
but that &apos;s not the way most scientists think .
rna provides the information for protein .
and the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it .
we ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar ; there &apos;s a relationship .
and in discovery phase , we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring .
it turns out , because they &apos;re paid on contingency , it works really , really well in reverse .
&quot; i haven &apos;t heard from my dad in years . &quot;
we want every girl to experience the dance , right ? &quot;
because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve , and how they see us for the rest of our lives .
this disease was terrifying .
now all of these outbreaks that i just showed you , these are under control now , and it looks like they &apos;ll probably stop very , very quickly .
and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries .
within a couple of years , every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses , with the exception of four countries that you see here .
he got 100 percent in all the important things , like nursery rhymes , for example there .
over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio -- uttar pradesh and bihar -- 500,000 children every single month .
thank you .
dereck joubert : well , our lives have basically been like a super long episode of &quot; csi &quot; -- something like 28 years .
dj : now one of the big things , of course , everybody knows that cats hate water , and so this was a real revelation for us .
i had tears rolling down my cheeks .
bj : and on this first hunt , we truly were excited .
and of course , looking at this lion paw that has been skinned , it eerily reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic , because their fate is in our hands .
my title : &quot; queerer than we can suppose : the strangeness of science . &quot;
science has taught us , against all intuition , that apparently solid things , like crystals and rocks , are really almost entirely composed of empty space .
in the same way , our lives are dominated by gravity but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension .
a monkey &apos;s brain must have software capable of simulating a three-dimensional world of branches and trunks .
in the vastness of astronomical space and geological time , that which seems impossible in middle world might turn out to be inevitable .
the economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful , goal-seeking agent with pleasures and pains , desires and intentions , guilt , blame-worthiness .
it took me several years , but with the help of an incredibly supportive family , i finally decided life was still worth living .
one of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream a reality .
devices like the cymascope , which you can see here , have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns .
i think collectively we can build a global community .
a word about galvao , a very rare kind of bird native to brazil .
that &apos;s a much higher number than in the u.s. or u.k .
and he &apos;s looking at something really , truly absurd , which is bottles of evian water on the table .
two hops , you &apos;re in suva , the capitol of fiji .
and before you conclude that this is just a function of american tv news -- which is dreadful , and i agree that it &apos;s dreadful -- i &apos;ve been mapping elite media like the new york times , and i get the same thing .
one of those dark spots is madagascar , a country which is generally better known for the dreamworks film than it is actually known for the lovely people who live there .
and my question to you is : if yeeyan can line up 150,000 people to translate the english internet into chinese , where &apos;s the english language yeeyan ?
but with the internet , she &apos;s in a position where she can tell a lot of people what to read .
and his reason for this is not just that he wants to master muay thai boxing .
distinguished academics at the same time argued that democracies had this incredible range of side benefits .
in britain , it could mean looking to the french , learning from the french , getting directly elected mayors in place in a french commune system .
tasty !
in fact , the chinese had their own version of broccoli , which is called chinese broccoli , but right now , what -- they &apos;ve now discovered american broccoli , and are importing it as a , sort of , exotic delicacy .
let &apos;s go back to mid-1800s when the chinese first came to america .
for example , there is french chinese food , where they serve salt and pepper frog legs .
so , like , ok , maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know , like , it was a diamond , or , you know , diagonal .
so me , general tso &apos;s chicken and this logo are all karmacally related .
so what we see in the seventeenth , eighteenth century is the continued search for medications other than camphor that &apos;ll do the trick .
and of course , in those days , there were no antidepressant drugs , and it became very , very popular .
finally , i would schedule -- all my major surgical cases , i was scheduling them for 12 , one o &apos;clock in the afternoon , because i couldn &apos;t get out of bed before about 11 o &apos;clock .
and finally , because i was well known in connecticut , they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff .
and he went back to them , and they agreed to do another 10 .
well , you know , it &apos;s been a wonderful life .
and for those who are older , who have lived through perhaps not something as bad as this , but who have lived through difficult times , perhaps where they lost everything , as i did , and started out all over again , some of these things will seem very familiar .
when you actually look at the motor of the world economy , it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries .
one end of the beach there is a house containing a family of five nigerians .
how do you persuade people that it is in their interest to build strong ... after the second world war , we built institutions , the united nations , the imf , the world bank , the world trade organization , the marshall plan .
can you picture , in our lifetimes , a politician ever going out on a platform of the kind of full-form global ethic , global citizenship ?
the imf now has limited resources , one percent .
it &apos;s sustainable ; it &apos;s a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature -- and is biodegradable with a clock , so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years .
and the image of the dvd here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface , which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale .
and maybe you can use that liquid kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins , for example , or maybe an entire bone .
or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge .
so it knows something about the subject ; it knows about the length .
data : pretty lucky for them .
hk : yay .
what can we do together that benefits us both ?
strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that i need right now , that enables me to find the sources of intimacy , of discovery , and of inspiration that i need right now .
so , i got working . i took some sheets of paper and started practicing , practicing , practicing , until i reached what i thought was a steady hand , and went into action .
finally they were all arrested and taken to the drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their argentinean papers .
to him , being paid would have meant being a mercenary .
there , just once , it happened in may of 1968 .
we &apos;ve had the same , roughly , abilities that developed civilizations as we know it .
and i can tell you , you enter the disciplinary research in each of these , you find something remarkably important , the conclusion that we may have come to the point where we have to bend the curves , that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade in the history humanity on the planet , the decade when we have to bend the curves .
and could we even , thanks to major advancements in earth systems science , identify the thresholds , the points where we may expect nonlinear change ?
in fact , there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change , that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative , a transformative gear , across scales .
and we need a transformation .
and i only have 15 minutes , and i see they &apos;re counting already .
somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .
and the half tombstone , for people who are not dead yet .
and the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings .
i used the dust at the whitney museum to render some pieces of their collection .
i wasn &apos;t interested in the very large things , or in the small things .
and the information is there twice -- one on each strand -- which is important , because when new cells are formed , these strands come apart , new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process .
and since there are many genetic variants , and they have different such gradients , this means that if we determine a dna sequence -- a genome from one individual -- we can quite accurately estimate where that person comes from , provided that its parents or grandparents haven &apos;t moved around too much .
what happened to the neanderthals ?
so this individual comes from a population but far back and then have a long independent history .
we only can create a vision of the future , how it might be , a vision which reveals disruptive ideas , which is inspiring , and this is the most important reason which breaks the chains of common thinking .
and then we are talking also about materials , synthetic biology , for example .
we have social areas inside the aircraft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf .
you see , babies are born in a state of utter fragility .
so something that in other species are survival mechanisms , without them they wouldn &apos;t basically live , we bring into the context of human beings , and this is what we need to simply act , act socially .
but it diminishes considerably .
those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds , and we freeze one frame , and this is what the typical children are doing .
and we want to do that universally so that we don &apos;t miss any child , but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention , for treatment .
you sit there , ok .
so you look around , where you &apos;re going to land , you try to make yourself ready .
and i saw my battalion commander , because i had let him down .
so how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven &apos;t done what the people you &apos;re leading are doing ?
i came to believe that a leader isn &apos;t good because they &apos;re right ; they &apos;re good because they &apos;re willing to learn and to trust .
and in the course of the exhibition -- which was contentious , controversial and ultimately , for me , life-changing in my sense of what art could be -- a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other .
a profound statement about the individual and the community .
and as many of us think about that continent and think about what if means to us all in the 21st century , i have begun that looking through artists , through artworks , and imagining what they can tell us about the future , what they tell us about our future , and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue .
the truth is , we can build a better world , and we can do so right now .
you may already know some of the big-picture aspects : globally , more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera , and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens , and over the network -- and sometimes enter history books .
and what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today .
we &apos;d have a far better -- far better knowledge of what &apos;s happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone .
i connected high speed internet to it -- it &apos;s about three feet off the ground -- turned it on and left it there .
and he couldn &apos;t travel , so i went over there .
at that time , a large amount of money had come into newcastle university to improve schooling in india .
remember , they don &apos;t study english .
&quot; you can exchange groups .
teacher : you can &apos;t catch me .
i said , &quot; well , do it . &quot;
education scientist sugata mitra tackles one of the greatest problems of education -- the best teachers and schools don &apos;t exist where they &apos;re needed most . in a series of real-life experiments from new delhi to south africa to italy , he gave kids self-supervised access to the web and saw results that could revolutionize how we think about teaching .
it was deemed to be an unpredictable event .
the plot with the red and the green blobs , this is plotting different components of the data against each other .
and i did , and we ended up naming it duterimbere , meaning &quot; to go forward with enthusiasm . &quot; and while we were doing it , i realized that there weren &apos;t a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women , and so maybe i should try to run a business , too .
and she said , &quot; nothing . &quot; and i said , &quot; what ? &quot;
the first one is called advanced bio-extracts limited .
it started in japan . sumitomo had developed a technology essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide , so you could create a bed net , a malaria bed net , that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped .
and that some of the channels we thought would work didn &apos;t work .
50-million-plus views on youtube .
but you don &apos;t want to have to reset the whole machine because the lego car at the end doesn &apos;t work , right .
so what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats but also reflect our diversity ?
the rat is an entire organism , after all , with interacting networks of organs .
this is unprecedented , and it &apos;s big .
we can &apos;t go into that today because there isn &apos;t time -- it &apos;s a broad subject . one thing for sure , in the future there is an essential feature -- necessary , but not sufficient -- which is doing more with less . we &apos;ve got to be doing things with more efficiency using less energy , less material .
it &apos;s part of a long-term program nasa sponsored .
ok .
well , inspired by the sentences , i decided to wield the paintbrush .
paul maccready : nature vs. humans
i explained it to all my friends . maths is beautiful .
a random odd number is a lot harder to test .
and at a gathering of prestigious american mathematicians , he walked to the board , took up a piece of chalk , and started writing out the powers of two : two , four , eight , 16 -- come on , join in with me , you know how it goes -- 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , 512 , 1,024 , 2,048 .
in an amazing moment of serendipity , i had to send ted a new slide to show you what this guy had done .
first of all , as i explained , to ask a computer &quot; is that number prime ? &quot; to type it in its abbreviated form , and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy , is a remarkably simple question to ask .
it might have been a book i read , the arts . no , no , no .
the tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger , and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals .
so cancer could be thought of as a strange , short-lived , self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end .
in fact , genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old , which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the neanderthals .
that means that out of five married couples , two will end up splitting their assets .
so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities .
then he said , &quot; how much are you willing to pay to get a kiss from a celebrity if the kiss was delivered immediately , in three hours , in 24 hours , in three days , in one year , in 10 years ?
the way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it .
the average likelihood is about 30 percent , &quot; the next time around they would say , &quot; yep . still think it &apos;s about 11 percent . &quot;
now we interfere with the region that we found to integrate negative information in this task , and the optimism bias grew even larger .
thank you .
now , anybody has that capacity , which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors .
but we need a new narrative if we &apos;re to understand power in the 21st century .
let me mention three reasons why it &apos;s too simple .
notice both halves of that explanation .
if china develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions , that &apos;s good for us as well as good for china as well as good for everybody else .
i &apos;m going to talk about post-conflict recovery and how we might do post-conflict recovery better .
and that needs to be recognized , first of all , that peacekeeping works .
so that &apos;s idea one : recognize interdependence .
basically , prices soar and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector , but it doesn &apos;t generate any jobs .
clean means follow their money .
this talk is about being prepared for , and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home , the earth .
and around the world , satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood-prone areas such as bangladesh .
it makes sense , right ? there &apos;s open space , the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings .
there are no one-size-fits-all solutions .
students : a t-shirt . a dress .
but with english you can become part of a wider conversation : a global conversation about global problems , like climate change or poverty , or hunger or disease .
now i &apos;m going to try and argue for a third alternative that &apos;s much more illuminating than either of those , and to put this into perspective , let &apos;s imagine that a martian came down to earth and found a ruined civilization .
and he said , &quot; of course not .
that is , we &apos;ve gone from four to eight years of education to 12 years of formal education , and 52 percent of americans have actually experienced some type of tertiary education .
compare the doctor in 1900 , who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve , with the modern general practitioner or specialist , with years of scientific training .
who have you ever known who woke up in the morning -- -- that turned black ?
the similarities subtest of the wechsler is about classification , and we have made enormous gains on that classification subtest .
lord curzon once said he saw people bathing in the north sea , and he said , &quot; why did no one tell me what white bodies the lower orders have ? &quot;
and i &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
his name is chris farina .
my father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
there are four countries around the board .
stewart brand is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a coevolution quarterly article on a peace force .
and that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up .
&quot; let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
the way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s asset value has to be increased above its starting point .
and there are three seconds left on the clock .
lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the national movement .
and they have some wonderful properties .
now this was -- you make a joint of six , you make an icosahedron .
well in terms of -- if you were in andhra pradesh , you would make this with the palmyra leaf .
and you don &apos;t need the three billion-dollar hadron collider for doing this .
look , this is the tetrapak -- awful materials from the point of view of the environment .
this is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old cds .
they were singing and dancing .
so i &apos;m going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas .
in ecosystems , the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system .
the converse is also true .
it &apos;s a challenge to our ingenuity .
they &apos;re not just possible ; they &apos;re critical .
one first saying that i &apos;m sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse .
what we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games , they actually resolve the conflict faster .
now i &apos;d like you to remember that result , and put it in the context of another group of technology users , a group which is actually much revered by society , which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking .
like , the reason that i asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing , right ?
but what about the space of all possible programs ?
it &apos;s connected to , what i call , the principle of computational equivalence , which tells us that even incredibly simple systems can do computations as sophisticated as anything .
but the goal is to go much further and , very broadly , to democratize all of this knowledge , and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas .
let me show you a couple of examples here .
the challenge is to see how to harness them for human purposes .
i don &apos;t know for sure , but i think at this point it &apos;s sort of almost embarrassing not to at least try .
benoit has been particularly interested in nested patterns , in fractals and so on , where the structure is something that &apos;s kind of tree-like , and where there &apos;s sort of a big branch that makes little branches and even smaller branches and so on .
we all know about the miracle of miniaturization .
these are the maasais .
teachers looked nice .
as i opened my leg , another woman came , and this woman was carrying a knife .
everybody who is my dad &apos;s age , male in the community , is my father by default -- my uncles , all of them -- and they dictate what my future is .
and as we speak right now , three million girls in africa are at risk of going through this mutilation .
and i looked at her , i remember that day , and i saw something beyond what i was seeing in angeline .
so , if you &apos;ve been gone , this is the easy cliffsnotes on what &apos;s happened in the economy . okay ?
they are taking responsibility .
if you think about the last three decades , the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the &apos; 90s , to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade , but the one thing that has been holding them back is the ability to discriminate .
so it takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups , to the weather , to the team records , in setting prices for the consumer .
did you know that 68 percent of americans now carry a library card ?
everything about locally derived products and services , supporting your local neighborhoods , whether it &apos;s cheeses , wines and other products .
it will make longer-lasting products . it will create better , more intuitive customer service .
and maybe somebody &apos;s never said that to you , but you &apos;ve done a really , really good job .
we &apos;re born into a certain family , nation , class .
so from this small , superstitious , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , i was zoomed into this posh , international school &#91; in madrid &#93; , where i was the only turk .
i &apos;m not an immigrant , refugee or exile -- they ask me why i do this -- but the commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself .
many authors feel this pressure , but non-western authors feel it more heavily .
but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction .
when the poet and mystic , rumi , met his spiritual companion , shams of tabriz , one of the first things the latter did was to toss rumi &apos;s books into water and watch the letters dissolve .
and i would like to finish with an old sufi poem : &quot; come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us be lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot;
this one &apos;s more about the lyric .
steve jobs : and we have invented a new technology called multi-touch .
he said , &quot; good artists copy . great artists steal . &quot;
so , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in america and a japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
so , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . they get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
that percentage , by the way , is about the same in the u.s. and germany and france .
but that &apos;s not the prime candidate for life in the solar system .
so the apollo program paid for itself in inspiration , in engineering , achievement and , i think , in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over .
and one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics , just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that describes transistors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.4 times the mass of the sun .
so , i think science can be -- serendipity is important .
that &apos;s here . that &apos;s home . that &apos;s us .
today , what many of us would love to believe is that the internet is a private place ; it &apos;s not .
we are not even two bites into breakfast and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me .
today we &apos;ve launched collusion .
that &apos;s a big thing in california .
so on this first day i actually listened .
the first story is i didn &apos;t have any money -- that &apos;s a sign i used a lot .
i just backed out of that , you know , and i just kind of kept the fists from flying .
&quot; yeah , i want to make a difference . &quot;
the road turned into the jungle .
as our former vice president said , we have to become activists .
so i started to steal from food carts in illegal markets .
i went to america without knowing a word of english , yet my social worker told me that i had to go to high school .
in the same way , you may also change someone &apos;s life with even the smallest act of love .
my goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
1994 , there was a big disaster in rwanda , africa .
so during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
so i proposed to the mayor , i &apos;d like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
so this is under construction .
today i want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering about what fetuses learn while they &apos;re still in their mothers &apos; bellies .
six months later , the women &apos;s infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice , and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it .
in the autumn of 1944 , the darkest days of world war ii , german troops blockaded western holland , turning away all shipments of food .
this story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems -- an adaptation to prevailing circumstances that facilitates its future survival .
learning is one of life &apos;s most essential activities , and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined .
the tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction .
we all want to share our stories , whether it is the trick we saw at the party , the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation .
so there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work , i think , in many areas of human problem solving , particularly those which involve human psychology , which is : the tendency of the organization or the institution is to deploy as much force as possible , as much compulsion as possible , whereas actually , the tendency of the person is to be almost influenced in absolute reverse proportion to the amount of force being applied .
it &apos;s frankly more memorable than all those millions of hotels we &apos;ve all stayed at that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated at a cost of 500,000 dollars , in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you &apos;ve ever stayed in in the entire course of your life .
so i did come up with five suggestions , which they are actually actioning .
and if you think about it , it &apos;s very , very important that the strategy myth is maintained .
every corporation should have one , and every government should have a ministry of detail .
but it sort of creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny , tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology .
i was very eager to be useful in the world -- i think we all have that feeling .
it became a transaction for me , became sort of a trade .
they might be able to buy mosquito nets .
and while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they &apos;re interesting , to me , kiva &apos;s really about stories .
i see entrepreneurs everywhere now , now that i &apos;m tuned into this .
so what i think i can do today , that best thing i can give you -- i &apos;ve given you my story , which is the best i can do .
if not , what created the universe ?
why would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes ?
stephen hawking : questioning the universe
this thing — whoops , can we go back ?
but what i plotted here is just some metric that shows how fast we &apos;re searching .
suppose some time in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company .
so those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection .
and in fact , here &apos;s an example : the higgs boson , finding the higgs boson .
i remember when a guy came to our high school , actually , it was actually my junior high school . i was in sixth grade .
and we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn &apos;t describe : these blinking lights -- a world of bioluminescence , like fireflies .
still exploring the deep , but learning lots from the shallow water .
for example , garbage discharge , something you would think just simply goes away , but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore .
but what makes the ross sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what , till recently , has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem .
what i find so exciting is that the census of marine life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators ; it &apos;s also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column , where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found .
and in the seat next to me was a high school student , a teenager , and she came from a really poor family .
frank gehry -- frank gehry said to me , &quot; my mother pushed me . &quot;
there are 200 million tweets being posted every day .
but what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
he gives half of them vitamin b12 .
so it &apos;ll show you gdp per capita , population , longevity , that &apos;s about it .
you could count them in five minutes .
it falls to the floor .
ten percent of americans don &apos;t disappear every year .
there &apos;s this one trial he ran many years after world war ii .
it &apos;s incredibly painful .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s not nice or pleasant or that it &apos;s bad for polar bears or forests , though it certainly is .
the only problem with this plan is that it &apos;s not possible .
when does this breakdown begin ?
when the system was so clearly breaking down , mom and dad , what did you do , what were you thinking ? &quot;
and how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that ?
the earth can support that if we choose the right path .
and your friendly citibank had 47 times .
i think i can safely say that i &apos;m the only trillionaire in this room .
but let me remind you this december it did snow in vegas .
you can go out and get your proteins , your rna , your dna , whatever .
but now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering , let me show you what &apos;s happened in that period of time .
last year , this group was able to take all the cells off a heart , leaving just the cartilage .
and as you bring these things together , as you bring cells , biological tissue engineering and mechanics together , you begin to get some really odd questions .
and darwin , of course , argued that evolution is a natural state .
and one of the good things about this cure was that it was free , virtually free , and was very easy to use .
and what i &apos;d like to talk to you about today is some of the evidence why i believe this to be true : that for children two years old and up , there really is no real benefit -- proven benefit -- of car seats , in spite of the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts . and then talk about why -- what is it that makes that true ?
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s a great idea . &quot;
i mean , why not start -- who &apos;s sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids ?
even if they &apos;re right , it &apos;s not so clear that they &apos;re so cost-effective .
5,000 days without interruption -- that &apos;s just unbelievable .
so by the year 2040 , the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity , in raw bits and stuff . and this is , i think , where ray kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we &apos;re going to cross .
so every item , every artifact that we make , will have embedded in it some little sliver of web-ness and connection , and it will be part of this machine , so that our environment -- kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense -- our environment becomes the web . everything is connected .
the second stage that we &apos;re in now is the idea of linking pages .
a semantic web , web 3.0 , giant global graph -- we &apos;re kind of trying out what we want to call this thing .
and all these devices will be portals into that .
i started going out on cases .
these easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable .
and i organize it . and , well , it &apos;s also a bit different because an architect versus , let &apos;s say , a dance company finally is a negotiation between one &apos;s private world , one &apos;s conceptual world , the world of ideas , the world of aspirations , of inventions , with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations , the naysayers .
we &apos;re producing spaces that accommodate human activity .
we &apos;re working with keith sonnier in new york , and we &apos;re making this large outside room , which is possible in los angeles , and which is very much reflective of the urban , the contemporary urban environments that you would find in shibuya or you &apos;d find in mexico city or sao paulo , etc . , that have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time .
and the second project that was just finished in los angeles that uses some of the same ideas . it uses landscape as a major idea .
and it led us to the project , the courthouse , which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse .
and you need some design to be successful .
you can continue to innovate and invent .
and between this muscle , they found nervous tissues , a lot of nervous tissues , which penetrate actually the muscle -- penetrate the submucosa , where you have all the elements for the immune system .
so if you override the hunger signal , you can have a disorder , which is called anorexia .
and i spent two months in the caves of southwest france with the poet clayton eshleman , who wrote a beautiful book called &quot; juniper fuse . &quot;
we spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be 100 without losing our teeth .
and then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses .
fields are planted in such an extraordinary way , that the one side of the field is planted like that by the women .
these are not dying peoples .
in a single cubic foot of this material -- about what would come around your computer or large television -- you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol .
but nature provides us with a really good model here .
so what you &apos;re seeing here is actually cotton hulls from texas , in this case .
you want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls , because you have multiple choices .
and the atoms themselves are quite violent , but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency , an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down .
the most surprising thing that i &apos;ve learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research .
many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution , and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods .
when they say to you , &quot; what do you do ? &quot; -- you say , &quot; i &apos;m a statistician . &quot;
so you might think there are more interesting things to do , but humor me for the moment .
it takes longer , on average .
this is my little diversion into my real passion , which is genetics .
we don &apos;t know what causes them .
amongst all these other people who don &apos;t have the disease , the test will get it right 99 percent of the time .
so that &apos;s what statisticians would call an assumption of independence .
we want to know how likely , or relatively how likely , two different explanations are .
we are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .
peter donnelly : how juries are fooled by statistics
we call this technology efci , electrical fault circuit interrupter .
you can &apos;t just tell a one sided story .
that &apos;s the biggest population of netizens , internet users , in the whole world .
because we have 300 million microbloggers in china .
and also , the clone , sina company is the guy who cloned twitter .
chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people .
so these three years , in the past three years , social movements about microblogging really changed local government , became more and more transparent , because they can &apos;t access the data .
but also , it gave the chinese a national public sphere for people to , it &apos;s like a training of their citizenship , preparing for future democracy .
music is just one of the strangest things that there is .
and that was the best you could do for hearing loss .
girl : i just take off my ci , and i don &apos;t hear anything .
now the problems begin first with pitch perception .
now the next question is , well how does it really sound ?
if we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music -- because right now there &apos;s virtually no effort put towards that , no rehabilitative strategies , very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music -- we would come a long way .
and let me tell you right now , it &apos;s fine that we would all be very happy with speech .
in many countries it is a different story .
but with an old gun , not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark .
secondly , the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further .
i hope you will respect my soldiers , this soldier with this gun .
so i &apos;ve joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using dna . we use dna because it &apos;s cheaper .
it &apos;s pretty simple . there are nine , sort of , rules that i discovered after 35 years of rock climbing .
but if you &apos;re the leader on it , at the hardest move , you &apos;re looking at about 100 foot fall , onto some low angle slabs .
well , it &apos;s great to be here .
there are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance , capacity , bandwidth .
so homo sapiens , the first technology-creating species , the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage -- and by the way , chimpanzees don &apos;t really have a very good opposable thumb -- so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination , and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology .
in fact , when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm , it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm .
we had deflation during the depression , but that was collapse of the money supply , collapse of consumer confidence , a completely different phenomena .
and this technology is also accelerating .
these are 2020-circa scenarios , but they &apos;re not as futuristic as it may sound .
images will be written directly to our retina , providing full-immersion virtual reality , augmented real reality . we &apos;ll be interacting with virtual personalities .
they both empower our promise and our peril .
we connect the dots : a is connected to b ; b is connected to c .
and is it really a horse ?
the fish is degraded 20 percent , 50 percent and then the one i showed you , 70 percent .
and of course you all know exactly what this is , right ?
and there &apos;s two types of cells that do this , that record facial features either globally , or specifically these large , rapid-firing cells , first look at the general face .
our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these .
girl : oh my god !
the first is how it deals with this obstacle that we &apos;ve put in its way . see , look , it does a little dance , and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place .
and see what his response is .
so we described these as cool boots .
now there &apos;s two ways it could be doing that , and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it &apos;s at the foraging site .
thank you .
so if we were to render these sounds visually , we might end up with something like this .
actually , it &apos;s all just an idea .
and i still had this dream to make an actual , physical luxo jr. lamp .
when humans and robots interact , it &apos;s much more like a chess game .
and i thought : how can we make an artificial intelligence model -- computer , computational model -- that will model some of these ideas of improvisation , of taking risks , of taking chances , even of making mistakes .
marimba , for everybody who was like me , it was this huge , wooden xylophone .
so we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot , which was nice .
and i want these robots to be -- to be more fluent , more engaging , more graceful than currently they seem to be .
we shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver , and not a gem , nor any coal or iron .
i can try to tell you what it was like , but you &apos;ll never know what it was like , and the more i try to explain that i felt lonely , i was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles , it was cold , nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day , the more words fall short , and i &apos;m unable to do it justice .
in life , we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to , and i think metaphorically speaking , at least , we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often , if only we could sum up the courage .
so the most important thing is integrity .
you &apos;ve got to know your area .
and you have to have rational projections and stuff .
you want to be able to get them to such an emotional high that they are ready to write you a check , throw money at you , right there before you leave .
and it &apos;s a very tricky path to do it .
what &apos;s good ? short , short bullet points .
that lets me know the context .
i want to know exactly what your competition is , and then that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation over here .
what &apos;s the capital structure up until this point ?
because i &apos;m using remote control over here .
so the next rule of the game is also pretty simple .
fireflies are not flies , fireflies are beetles .
germans occupied russia .
we &apos;re the saddest place on earth , relative to gdp per capita -- the saddest place on earth .
babies play , kids play , adults play .
so what happens ?
just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &quot;
yours truly : humans .
little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
our thinking is backwards .
i care that your customer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
let them take long lunches .
think about episodes that happened live on radio .
interestingly , though , it wasn &apos;t just twitter as a distribution mechanism .
and i am illustrating still .
in my shop where i studied , or learned , there was a traditional hierarchy of master , journeyman and learned worker , and apprentice , and i worked as the apprentice .
this was my first job .
these are some pieces of things i used in my sputnik feature film , which opens in new york in two weeks downtown .
thank you everybody .
rg : when we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at , with these beautiful images , and looked at the scene in our actual living room , it looked a little bit more like this .
the reason you &apos;re not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing .
i was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors .
and i think , with a death , you have a funeral , you celebrate the life , and there &apos;s a lot of community support , and it &apos;s something women don &apos;t have with miscarriage .
as you get older , you become more stable .
get out of the airplane , it turns out you &apos;re trekking in nepal .
and , you know , it &apos;s a thing your piano teacher teaches you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things .
and the experience is : i want to be in the room and hear the musicians .
and at some point he &apos;s dancing with his -- and i won &apos;t ruin the episode for you , from 1967 .
we made a new recording of him playing in the shrine auditorium in september .
there &apos;s a definition of leadership which says , &quot; it &apos;s the ability to use the smallest possible crisis for the biggest possible effect . &quot;
there will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year , thousands losing their jobs everyday in america .
don &apos;t overdo it . &quot;
and his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers , not from a theory , but from experiment , and experiment involving the people with the best intelligence on social needs , which were usually the people living with those needs .
it will become more involved in social investment , and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others , not just from what you sell to them , and from relationships as well as from consumption .
the global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that &apos;s actually one of the oldest questions in economics , dating back to at least before adam smith .
in contrast to that , that &apos;s almost exactly what you would say in chinese .
what you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak futured languages .
there are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself .
i have been living and teaching in the gulf for over 30 years .
but indeed , that is exactly what we do .
it &apos;s a circular thing .
the thing that is exciting was , in 1976 , i suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane because i &apos;d made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars , or i guaranteed the money at the bank .
but this last time , just coming round , right now , suddenly , there &apos;d be huge changes in the environment , in the concentration of people , and it was just unbelievable , the amount of -- all the change in it .
well , that &apos;ll be all the slides .
let &apos;s have the next video .
paul maccready : a flight on solar wings
and so , again , he goes back . and after 12 years there is still no vision .
the future buddha has come ahead of all predictions . here he is . &quot;
we expand . we take the feeling about remembering a mama , and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation .
if your enemy was really happy , why would they bother to be your enemy ?
and that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us : we are responsible for that , and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it .
why is that important ?
we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is .
that &apos;s a bono , this is a bono .
it turns things on and off , but it does so without moving parts and it doesn &apos;t fail , basically , for a very long period of time .
you carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another , and they support weight .
so , let me close -- let me close with my two aphorisms .
gw : that &apos;s coming out soon . i mean , the systems work , and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind , but the basic technology works .
special people , special places , think up special ideas , then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers , who are passive .
big corporations have an in-built tendency to reinforce past success .
over here , let &apos;s imagine we &apos;ve got wikipedia , linux , and beyond -- open source .
what should be the role of public policy ?
so here is one of the challenges , i think , for people like me , who do a lot of work with government .
my favorite of these photos , which i couldn &apos;t find , is there &apos;s a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so with a little baby on her lap , and the next photo is a 220-lb man with a tiny , little old lady peaking over his shoulder .
that song -- thank you .
i guess the shoes came off when he was hit .
some came from the party who had just lost .
so she had seen the &quot; scared &quot; song and wondered if i could do something .
it &apos;s blind experiments . they also gave me normal people and everything .
and what i think might happen in these areas of the world , where we have constant violence , you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence .
so the moral of the story is : people in glass houses shouldn &apos;t throw stones .
you get some sense of the size : 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter , 7,000 tons .
imagine a snowflake in your hand , and you look at it , and it &apos;s an incredibly complicated , beautiful object . but as you heat it up , it &apos;ll melt into a pool of water , and you would be able to see that , actually , it was just made of h20 , water .
fortunately , we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern .
well , what the higgs does is , it gives mass to the fundamental particles .
so , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
then light began to travel through the universe .
when i grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers , i decided instead to embark on a journey of real science , to find a more useful truth .
his theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better -- rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good .
when we painted the first building , by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of a facade , something unimaginable happened .
we removed 123,000 tons of concrete only from the riverbanks .
barack obama won — — because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks .
it was about two meters high , completely squashed by the violence of the earthquake .
and it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender-based violence .
you can feel the dynamism of this living , breathing community .
we need technology as a core organizational principle .
i think there &apos;s nothing like a crisis to tell you what &apos;s really important and what &apos;s not , and sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter .
what happens when time warps ?
and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror .
you and i know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment .
because that &apos;s really the moment we really know what we &apos;re made of .
so , this woman , who converted from the church of england to catholicism when she married my father -- and there &apos;s no one more rabid than a catholic convert -- decided to teach in the rural areas in nigeria , particularly among igbo women , the billings ovulation method , which was the only approved birth control by the catholic church .
but when it came for harvest time , they would sing these joyful songs , that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that year .
so , i was born two days after christmas .
then i &apos;d say , &quot; how do you know ? &quot;
this gin , this salty earth . &quot;
the first theory of the case is that &apos;s all she wrote .
that &apos;s how big the difference is one species to another .
three options : do you want the olympics to be a showcase for really hardworking mutants ?
here &apos;s a second experiment : if you could photocopy your body , maybe you also want to take your mind .
you &apos;ve also got people with who are extraordinarily smart , people who can remember everything they &apos;ve seen in their lives , people who &apos;ve got synesthesia , people who &apos;ve got schizophrenia .
thank you very much .
and then finally , if you spin opposite pairs of rotors faster than the other pair , then the robot yaws about the vertical axis .
so one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity .
so here you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum and then changes its orientation and then recovers .
they can be planar formations , they can be three-dimensional formations .
so the robot then figures out what the features are .
he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin , and the other bees are attracted to it .
a bit counterintuitive , right ?
so , what i do is honeybee research .
we have also some images of honey from brooklyn .
in the meantime i &apos;m also talking to you , so my life is going to complicated . bear with me .
and while i &apos;m starting to make some bread for you here , it &apos;s very important to understand what that revolution did to us .
and never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact .
it was invented by farmers in iraq and syria in particular .
and meat consumption in southeast asia and china in particular is what drives the prices of cereals .
that is not necessary .
there is all kinds of things we can do .
i want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future : to these anonymous farmers , that first bred the first wheat varieties ; and to the farmers of today , who &apos;ve been making this . and you don &apos;t even know who they are .
but when you get home or want to go indoors at your work , it &apos;s got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside .
why not in countries like the u.s. too ?
we &apos;re kind of like greedy kids , using it all up , aren &apos;t we ?
this male snake , 12 feet long , met another male king cobra .
why ? how could it happen ?
but out on the rivers there are still millions of people who are in really bad shape .
and the guy who is working there with them , he &apos;s from maharashtra , he said , &quot; i think he &apos;s after the nusha . &quot;
we used quantitative arteriography , showing the narrowing .
well , because it helps them get through the day .
for many people , those are choices worth making -- not to live longer , but to live better .
and the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories , and it slows the absorption so you don &apos;t get that rapid rise in blood sugar .
so , an optimal diet is low in fat , low in the bad carbs , high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats .
friendship , altruism , compassion , service – all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures -- once you stop trying to see the differences , these are the things in our own self-interest , because they free us from our suffering and from disease .
voice : i don &apos;t know how it &apos;s possible ...
now , this movie has floated around hollywood for well over half a century , and we first got involved with the project in the early &apos; 90s , with ron howard as the director .
of course , this was the holy grail of our industry , and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn &apos;t help either , because i &apos;m sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store , you know -- we see his face constantly .
being from the visual effects industry , we , with david , believed that we now had enough time , enough resources , and , god , we hoped we had enough money .
we needed the subtleties of the skin .
we could go up into the millions of polygons .
we went through this process , then , called retargeting .
so this was how the finished shot appeared in the film .
he &apos;s also in an old age home , he &apos;s in a nursing home around other old people , so he had to look exactly the same as the others .
and we found this right in this very state , in karnataka .
we gave cycle rickshaws .
the hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world .
and if you &apos;ve ever been on a camel , it is a very , very uncomfortable ride .
now , you can see copious amounts of saliva in there . &#91; unclear &#93; i call myself the unstable stable boy .
now , they will also defecate in certain areas .
jasmine has been his mate for some time .
and my hump ?
it doesn &apos;t have an environment that adapts to it ; it has to adapt to the environment .
so my whole picture of the animal kingdom , and including humans also , started to change at that time .
the second one is that the partner is willing to work even though he &apos;s not interested in the food .
now something on empathy .
that &apos;s consolation . it &apos;s very similar to human consolation .
and she should actually be choosing blindly .
the other one sees that .
so , now it &apos;s not about the leader anymore ; it &apos;s about them , plural .
and what a perfect place to do that , at ted .
and i have to say , thank god .
but i also learned that i was too healthy , and that was unhealthy .
to give just one example , we love crunchiness , mouthfeel .
and of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decisions , well , that &apos;s sure to grab people &apos;s attention .
really cool stuff .
and in some cases , oxytocin can even decrease cooperation .
all knowledge of the english language and the english alphabet has been lost .
we don &apos;t know what any of these symbols mean .
and the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of dravidian-speaking people in the north , actually near afghanistan , and they say that perhaps , sometime in the past , dravidian languages were spoken all over india and that this suggests that the indus civilization is perhaps also dravidian .
okay . right to left , how many ? okay .
what we found was that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases in predicting the correct symbol .
we found that the indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts .
it &apos;s just like our english and dutch example .
so we have no way of validating these particular readings , but if more and more of these readings start making sense , and if longer and longer sequences appear to be correct , then we know that we are on the right track .
and you may wonder , how do we know what these sounds are ?
but going from slinging some wire across rooftops in boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the atlantic ocean seabed is no easy matter .
but the noise didn &apos;t disappear .
we distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere , but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there .
i think the dalai lama should have heard that . i wish he &apos;d been there to hear that .
thank you .
but i think what &apos;s new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world .
i was sitting next to nelson mandela -- i was very privileged to do so -- when amy winehouse came onto the stage .
she was 11 years old ; her parents had both died from aids , her mother and then her father .
it is said that in ancient rome that when cicero spoke to his audiences , people used to turn to each other and say about cicero , &quot; great speech . &quot;
now it turns out that animals can go anywhere .
we biologically inspired this robot , named rhex , built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years .
now will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots ?
and you probably feel them if you grabbed it .
and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible .
mark cutkosky , though , is taking it a step further .
since we are such a visual species , it &apos;s hard for us to really understand this , so i &apos;ll use a mixture of figures and sounds and hope this can communicate it .
how about the setting in which animals need to use this call ?
i &apos;d also like to point out that sound doesn &apos;t obey boundaries .
unlike fins and blues , which disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans , the humpbacked whales congregate in local traditional breeding grounds , so they can make a sound that &apos;s a little higher in frequency , broader-band and more complicated .
here &apos;s the same call recorded from a hydrophone 500 miles away .
i &apos;ll describe a couple strategies .
and the international maritime organization responded very strongly , &quot; these are the new lanes . &quot;
of course , we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy .
you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way , pull up other information -- there are lots of web and information sources about places you might want to go -- you can zoom in , you can pull back out .
and we &apos;re seeing a steady increase among males .
boys &apos; brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way for change , novelty , excitement and constant arousal .
now , when you have initiatives like the $ 100 laptop , i kind of cringe at the idea that we &apos;re going to introduce a whole new generation of people to computing with this standard mouse-and-windows-pointer interface .
now , this gesture that we &apos;ve developed , again , is just putting two fingers down -- it &apos;s defining an axis of tilt -- and i can tilt up and down that way .
don &apos;t worry .
we need to move mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response , which is , effectively , recognition .
so civil action is vital , but it &apos;s also vital to take people who are at the level of rage and violent action to the next level , which is non-violent action .
that devotion we feel for the national football team .
one of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer , but he was lefty .
and you could play with the rhythm .
all right .
working with space and the lines in space in a different way .
and , we &apos;re just about to announce the zinio reader product that i believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read .
anyway , it &apos;s based on the london subway system .
these are all very low-budget videos , like quick prototypes .
so with seed-squeezers , and pumps , and hay-balers and very straightforward things that we &apos;re designing -- my students are doing this as class projects and ideo has donated their time to do this kind of work -- it &apos;s really amazing to see his success , martin &apos;s .
the late geoffrey dickens , m.p. was attending a fete in his constituency .
in the sufi faith , this great middle eastern religion , which some claim is the route of all religions , sufi masters are all telepaths , so they say .
one of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can &apos;t see . my son asked me this the other day , he said , &quot; dad , can you remember what i was like when i was two ? &quot;
electricity , you can &apos;t see that .
the first is ludwig wittgenstein who said , &quot; i don &apos;t know why we are here .
so what that means is , one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button .
we said , well instead of releasing the full text , we &apos;re going to release statistics about the books .
for instance , this one .
so for those of you who seek to be famous , we can learn from the 25 most famous political figures , authors , actors and so on .
what you expect is basically what you observe .
it &apos;s not that strove for mediocrity , it &apos;s just that the s used to be written differently , kind of like an f .
let &apos;s define listening as making meaning from sound .
why did i say that ?
it &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
now i don &apos;t know how to do that , but this is ted , and i think the ted community is capable of anything .
and then twitter came along , and made things even more magic , because i could ask instantly for anything anywhere .
she &apos;s an artist . he &apos;s a financial blogger for reuters , and they &apos;re pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath , and i have had thousands of nights like that and like that .
and the goal was 100,000 dollars .
it &apos;s about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough .
when i launched my wish last year , hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us .
while in iran at the same time abololo -- of course a nickname -- has pasted one single face of a woman to show his resistance against the government .
jr : one year of turning the world inside out
we are in the pre-paradigm days , if you want to use thomas kuhn .
rarely , you know : evolution did this and copernicus did this , where we have a new understanding of who we are .
i even think chris said something like this yesterday .
in the case of the solar system , the idea that the earth is spinning and the surface of the earth is going like a thousand miles an hour , and the earth is going through the solar system about a million miles an hour .
and the alligator has some very sophisticated senses .
i already said the word &quot; sentence . &quot; in music , if you &apos;ve heard a song before , if you heard jill sing those songs before , when she sings them , the next note pops into your head already -- you anticipate it as you &apos;re going . if it was an album of music , the end of one album , the next song pops into your head .
how do you store and recall these sequences or patterns ? it &apos;s spatio-temporal patterns .
not that robots aren &apos;t useful and people can build robots .
i understand that humans are so &quot; messed up &quot; -- to use a nice word , because i promised my mom i &apos;d stop using the f-bomb in public .
your robe gives it away . &quot;
it &apos;s hard work every day .
they could maybe volunteer that much .
i &apos;ve done the scrutiny of market data , the washing machine has penetrated below the air line , and today there &apos;s an additional one billion people out there who live above the &quot; wash line . &quot;
this group uses three , one each .
and she became dilma rousseff , the president-elect of one of the biggest democracies in the world -- moving from minister of energy to president .
&#91; @ adam last nite was a blast ! loved dat apple lol &#93; &#91; @ eve yep .. babe , know what happened to my pants tho ? &#93; we do reveal so much more information about ourselves online than ever before , and so much information about us is being collected by organizations .
in fact , we didn &apos;t develop the app to make it available , just as a proof of concept .
now , that movie is set in 2054 , about 40 years from now , and as exciting as that technology looks , it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you , and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect .
fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups disclose the same amount of information , as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers .
but in fact , in a few years , organizations will know so much about us , they will be able to infer our desires before we even form them , and perhaps buy products on our behalf before we even know we need them .
and so he goes around the room , and then as he &apos;s leaving the diner , he first-names almost everybody he &apos;s just met .
they get picked up by these creatures i &apos;ve called uber-moms , who are highly successful career women who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into harvard .
and i think when you synthesize this research , you start with three key insights .
we are now children of the french enlightenment .
and these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with iq .
the greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom .
i have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families , and children from well-to-do families , who are getting trafficked .
we felt , one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage .
can you just encompass these people too ?
for one thing , i just do not do uniforms .
you know , we have victorian design with an engine on it . that &apos;s all !
the bad words -- see , when people think about a place and they don &apos;t find a place on the map , they think , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;
you know , anybody who &apos;s read a children &apos;s book knows that love makes things real .
do you know what that says to me ?
it &apos;s kind of out past mars . it &apos;s a hike .
so i &apos;m really sorry . but when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language , or a flag stands for the united states , it &apos;s a symbol of the country -- then you &apos;re using it synecdochically .
and 15 years later , there are 100 of them and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times .
and something ... good luck with that one in the japanese translation room .
it &apos;s true .
titus was so bitter .
the subjects in this study were members of the u.s. military who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise to teach them what it &apos;s going to be like for them if they are ever captured as prisoners of war .
and in a study done in italy , researchers planted the false memory , when you were a kid , you witnessed demonic possession .
hello , santa claus .
before this switch was thrown , we didn &apos;t have in-car navigation systems giving turn-by-turn directions , because back then , gps couldn &apos;t tell you what block you were on , let alone what street .
it &apos;s not just that you &apos;ll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore , or your child when you &apos;re at disneyland .
carol isn &apos;t the first , and certainly won &apos;t be the last , to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment , worrisome situation caused by gps tracking .
it &apos;s built deeply into our systems and infrastructure .
we knew it wasn &apos;t going to be so hard , and we wanted to be the first to build one so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against gps spoofing .
we simply cannot tolerate gps jammers and spoofers , and yet , given the lack of effective legal means for protecting our privacy from the gps dot , can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on , for wanting to use them ?
so my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface .
soren enters the room . pop ! he goes invisible .
so we work with a lot of technology , but we don &apos;t really love technology , because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years .
but we move to cities , toward the bright lights , and one of the things that is there that we want , besides jobs , is electricity .
likewise , with solar , especially here in california , we &apos;re discovering that the 80 solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze 1,000 square miles of southern california desert .
in 2000 , he discovered that soot was probably the second leading cause of global warming , after co2 .
and this doesn &apos;t even account for the footprint on the ground .
as you can see from these pictures , the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes including agricultural land , range land or open space .
and one last slide i just want to show . this is the choice : you can either have wind or nuclear .
and this is an ongoing research . this is not rocket science .
for .
it was a sunny day and a windy night .
just put up ... hands up , people who changed their minds during the debate , who voted differently .
then , the world changed overnight .
six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty .
for example , term limits .
the department functions like a giant human resource engine that would be the envy of even some of the most successful corporations .
he started as a village manager , and by the time he entered the politburo , he had managed areas with a total population of 150 million people and combined gdps of 1.5 trillion u.s. dollars .
i don &apos;t need to elaborate for this audience how dysfunctional it is , from washington to european capitals .
corruption will be curbed , but not eliminated , and china will move up 10 to 20 notches to above 60 in t.i. ranking .
exl : you know , frank fukuyama , the political scientist , called the chinese system &quot; responsive authoritarianism . &quot;
in fact , i think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier .
they had to make up everything .
i have no question that the physics , the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner .
one of the things i &apos;m most happy about is that the spaceshipone is going to hang in air and space museum , next to the spirit of st. louis and the wright flyer .
if you were going to go and try to create spaceshipone , or any kind of a new technology , you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome .
nature has been called the greatest architect of forms .
i designed the process that generated the form .
and unlike traditional architecture , it &apos;s a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail .
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
so we have this huge challenge , this huge gap .
well , one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology , and a very important technology that we depend on for all of this is the human genome , the ability to be able to look at a chromosome , to unzip it , to pull out all the dna , and to be able to then read out the letters in that dna code , the a &apos;s , c &apos;s , g &apos;s and t &apos;s that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things , and the cost of doing this , which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars , has in the course of the last 10 years fallen faster than moore &apos;s law , down to the point where it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequenced , or mine , and we &apos;re headed for the $ 1,000 genome fairly soon .
sb : well , research on progeria has come so far in less than 15 years , and that just shows the drive that researchers can have to get this far , and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with progeria , and it shows that if that drive exists , anybody can cure any disease , and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future , and so we can eliminate those 4,000 diseases that francis was talking about .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to be able to a test a drug to see if it &apos;s effective and safe without having to put patients at risk , because that first time you &apos;re never quite sure ?
it matters for now . it matters as soon as possible .
which is why i prefer the richard wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global .
the existential and social and political impact an artist has on his nation &apos;s development of cultural identity is very important .
some of you might have heard of the algerian artist baya mahieddine , but i doubt a lot of people know that this artist worked in picasso &apos;s studio in paris in the 1930s .
it attracted 42,000 people , and we showcased 51 films .
what made me do it ? at school , i will admit this : academically , i couldn &apos;t express myself .
and then he said to me , &quot; i don &apos;t believe you can do it . can you really do it ? &quot;
then static electricity set in .
it must be a machine . &quot;
for us human beings , and certainly for us as muslims , whose mission , and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet .
but don &apos;t ignore what you &apos;ve asked them to do .
there &apos;s only one absolute reality by definition , one absolute being by definition , because absolute is , by definition , single , and absolute and singular .
and i lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line , and one of my neighbors came running over .
i would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters &apos; lives .
so what happened was i wrote a letter to each of these men .
only a hundred adults a year get one of these diseases .
it is an invitation , maybe even a mandate , to enter the most vital arenas of human life , the most sensitive and the most frightening , the ones that we never want to go to , but when we do go there , we feel incredibly transformed when we do .
at the risk of admission , i was never nicer than the year i was on crutches .
he had to have a lot of oxygen , and that affected your eyes , derek , and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world .
i just realized this is going to be recorded , isn &apos;t it ? right . okay .
now the truly amazing thing was , with all those scales , derek , you could not only play &quot; flight of the bumblebee &quot; in the usual key , but any note i play , derek can play it on .
ao : i should really get derek &apos;s manager to come and play it .
after all , the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often , preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls .
more than that , i like to buy books on it that i never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and i never look at them again and it &apos;s perfect .
we want to know about what other people do -- we &apos;re interested in it .
she loves her computer -- she &apos;ll leave her big group , and her running water , and her trees and everything .
they can actually live longer than 60 in captivity , so we &apos;ve only done 40 years in the wild so far .
and it &apos;s not sustainable , and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat , so the pygmy hunters in the congo basin who &apos;ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted .
i had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees for my students and field staff to continue studying because , finding they dwindled from about two million 100 years ago to about 150,000 now , i knew i had to leave the forest to do what i could to raise awareness around the world .
and the third kind of project : something for the local environment .
that &apos;s not the way to solve problems .
even after the 11th of september -- and i was in new york and i felt the fear -- nevertheless , there was so much human courage , so much love and so much compassion .
we consider first that life has a body .
some architectures .
the protocell moves . it encounters the food .
rather , they &apos;d be a real complex mixture of all kinds of stuff , because uncontrolled chemical reactions produce a diverse mixture of organic compounds .
without the sun , there &apos;s likely to be no life on this planet .
people who come to the clinic are called , not patients , but impatients , because they &apos;re too impatient to wait for legislative change to address local and environmental health issues .
they share your environmental stressors , the asbestos levels and lead levels , whatever you &apos;re exposed to .
anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality , or to understand it or to change it , the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with .
churches , school groups , hospitals , private residents -- everyone built one of these in a matter of months .
in fact , urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers .
hence , you could share some of your nutritional resources instead of monopolizing them .
and yellowstone national park , there &apos;s more &quot; do not feed the animals &quot; signs than there are animals you might wish to feed .
already in medicine , biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts , like ears , windpipes , skin , blood vessels and bone , that have been successfully implanted into patients .
it can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells , and better yet , there is no hair to remove , no scars or insect &apos;s bites , and no waste .
we need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved .
so we embarked upon the reinvention around an electrochemical engine , the fuel cell , hydrogen as the energy carrier .
i &apos;m very , very intrigued by the fact that our cars and trucks sit idle 90 percent of the time : they &apos;re parked , they &apos;re parked all around us .
i was born on a farm , a farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest &#91; still &#93; .
i saw in rwanda total brutality .
let &apos;s build the paradise again .
but there is another part that we must together rebuild , to build our societies , our modern family of societies , we are at a point where we cannot go back .
but you can see in this picture , we were starting to construct an educational center that became quite a large environmental center in brazil .
landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals .
so the city basically extended to city hall park .
we know that there was a lenape settlement down here by the collect pond .
and rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs .
and then we took this data .
this is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity .
if everybody on the planet lived the way we did , we &apos;d need between five , six , seven , some people even say 10 planets to make it .
we don &apos;t know how to do this yet .
nature , city . nothing changes .
there &apos;s a lot of this stuff happening ; it &apos;s really pretty remarkable .
so what we have , increasingly , is cell phones just permeating out through society .
so you also have the ability for people to start coming together and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways , in ways that haven &apos;t happened before .
well , very quickly , you get a bright green future for the developing world .
seriously -- give that one a hand , it &apos;s pretty great .
and kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday cake .
which meant that if you fielded average content , you got a third of the u.s. public for free -- tens of millions of users for simply doing something that wasn &apos;t too terrible .
it took them a while to formulate plan b .
suddenly , the burden of proof for legal versus illegal falls affirmatively on us and on the services that might be offering us any new capabilities .
they don &apos;t want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing .
1960 , the first internal pacemaker was implanted , hopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there , and the technology has continued to move forward .
they basically stuck an attacker on the wired network and on the wireless network .
they were able to compromise every single one of the pieces of software that controlled every single one of the wireless capabilities of the car .
so , would a terrorist organization want to black out the ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency ?
now , the system is interesting , because it produced &quot; illinois supreme &quot; and then it wasn &apos;t sure .
so in 1965 , i went to what was called the worst bihar famine in india , and i saw starvation , death , people dying of hunger , for the first time .
you have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout to come to our college .
no water , rocky soil . &quot;
but all the schools are solar-lit .
telephone ? no .
went to this village .
imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain , as though it was a world , and see tissues as landscapes , and hear blood density levels as music .
we &apos;re flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms -- oxygen , hydrogen and zinc .
when you have 21 minutes to speak , two million years seems like a really long time .
from field studies to laboratory studies , we see that winning or losing an election , gaining or losing a romantic partner , getting or not getting a promotion , passing or not passing a college test , on and on , have far less impact , less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have .
vegetably ? minerally ? animally ? he &apos;s pretty much covered them there .
natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted , and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don &apos;t get what we wanted .
&quot; really , jim , you don &apos;t remember ? i was just here with the monet prints ? &quot;
this is the difference between dating and marriage , right ?
is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to paris are just the same thing ? that seems like a one-question iq test .
up , up , up .
he grew up in a bohio of dirt floors , and the structure was the kind used by the tainos , our old arawak ancestors .
that kind of food , yeah .
&quot; i guess i must . &quot;
&quot; would this guy have , like , a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face ? &quot;
&quot; it won &apos;t upset me . why ? what ? is something wrong with him ? &quot;
a brevity , brevity of everything with this child .
people have pulled aside , i mean , they &apos;ve come out of that queue line , they have popped their trunks , pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks .
i almost miss it .
it means that i pay only for what i need .
and so when i think about the future , people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone is this incredibly great social event out of their day .
whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies will be happening with road pricing .
they mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals .
right now in the transportation sector , we &apos;re creating these wireless devices -- i guess you guys might have fast pass here or easy lane -- that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks .
and they got here in the late 1960s .
and for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness , you know how challenging it can be .
so attitude : look , we &apos;re all going to get lumps , and we &apos;re all going to get bumps .
roosevelt grier , or rosey grier , as people used to call him , grew up and grew into a 300-pound , six-foot-five linebacker in the nfl .
i would imagine that you &apos;d have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that you &apos;re starting to see in your new world .
when i stop to think about it , he &apos;s absolutely right .
dan rather : since the september 11th attack on the world trade center , many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground .
your work is highly sensual , even hedonistic .
i was actually asked to be a committee chair on an aia committee to rebuild .
and we also , frankly , knew that if it didn &apos;t happen by the end of the giuliani administration , then everyone who we were dealing with at the dot and the police department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time , and it was set up by the office of emergency management .
there was no thought of abandoning ship at that point ?
so that , very much , is in the realm of things i &apos;ve been interested in before .
including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting 10 architects who currently don &apos;t have a voice in new york to do artist housing .
but i did go on to be a reasonably astute , arguably world-class worrier .
how do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play , cleared for return to play , applies to them ?
you have to be familiar with the issues we &apos;re talking about today .
thank you .
and here is the real deal . here &apos;s what i believe .
because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form , it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy .
treatment programs became possible , funding became available , and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly .
so you can imagine that if you are a generic company about to decide whether to invest in the development of this product , unless you know that the licenses to these patents are actually going to be available , you will probably choose to do something else .
this has never been seen before .
and we know that from spain , we know that &quot; sol y sombra . &quot;
but that &apos;s not all what we need to do . we need to use active systems .
frugal digital is essentially a small research group at c.i.d .
it &apos;s this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts and supplies that are produced all over the world , literally , and then redistributed to basically service this industry , and you can even buy salvaged parts .
so we said , &quot; what are the steps required to empower the teacher ? &quot;
it &apos;s about this little device called a medi-meter .
so i take it into the start position , and then i press the read button .
and in my lab , i was studying the widower effect , which is a very old idea in the social sciences , going back 150 years , known as &quot; dying of a broken heart . &quot;
but the visual complexity is still very high .
now , headline writers had a field day with our studies .
now , when we have emotions , we show them .
and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch .
and now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you -- was spreading through the network ?
now , the reason , i think , that this is the case is that human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of superorganism .
and now , if you &apos;re the kind of person who can get chills from population statistics , these are the ones that should do it .
years ago , my colleagues and i embarked on a study where we followed the same group of people over a 10-year period .
maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we &apos;re unable to process negative emotions anymore .
my father , who is 92 , likes to say , &quot; let &apos;s stop talking only about how to save the old folks and start talking about how to get them to save us all . &quot;
and this is happening every day .
it is sometimes referred to as prisoner of war camp number 334 , and it is where the lakota now live .
the treaties were out the window .
1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the fort laramie treaties .
and i can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard : a people &apos;s dream died there , and it was a beautiful dream . &quot;
more than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line .
because the solution seems so far in the past , i needed nothing short of a time machine to access them .
now , there was a big effort to solve this problem , and there was actually a big solution .
well , it turns out -- and this is where things get really disconcerting -- it &apos;s not unique to diarrhea .
this machine is really strange , and one of the consequences is that people are weird .
i think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing .
the combination of that produces something that is actually , you got this thing wrong .
diarrhea , and many last mile problems , are like that .
turns out , go home and do the math , the nine to 11 is a bigger change . that person has saved more gallons .
i &apos;ve been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior .
we &apos;re spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now .
i mean , it sometimes feels , listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically , what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time .
so my wonderful student sam and i decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of : play-doh .
and now i can start talking about parallel and series circuits .
we &apos;re doing changing media .
three days later it faded , and a week later , no more complaining anywhere .
yeah !
if a card shark gathers the cards together , immediately when he -- before he deals the card . now , so i think , number three , i have arranged them in a full house .
here , i can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush .
and if you work with , in the right atmosphere , with humor , you have -- that &apos;s the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge , where you can find any solution of any problem .
just push them through , good . thank you .
three , four , five , six . then i calculate -- yeah , good .
we do it again .
now some hard stuff .
so here , here i have to peek , lots of cards .
i drop the cards and you -- which size ?
blindfolded .
ace of diamonds , yes ? zoe : yeah .
yes ? zoe : yeah .
lennart green : close-up card magic with a twist
and the 10-year-old , on every eight notes .
amazing number of people think they &apos;re tone-deaf .
composers know that . if they want sad music , they just play those two notes .
and i &apos;m going to play it all the way through and you &apos;re going to follow . b , c , b , c , b , c , b -- down to a , down to g , down to f .
and you know , it felt really good to cry for my brother . &quot;
shining eyes , shining eyes .
doesn &apos;t work .
i spent the last couple of years looking at the science of human motivation , particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators and intrinsic motivators .
so what really matters are the more right-brained creative , conceptual kinds of abilities .
what happens ?
these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses .
in a rowe people don &apos;t have schedules .
there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .
and i thought up a lot of ideas .
this is in sapporo .
this has a diamond-bottomed lake .
the idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show .
that &apos;s sage and annalisa and rider .
not necessarily . they might be smart .
in the same time , the number of for-profits that crossed it is 46,136 .
we netted for breast cancer alone , that year alone , 71 million dollars after all expenses .
dan pallotta : the way we think about charity is dead wrong
&quot; you come to work . how come you &apos;re so happy ? &quot;
when muti is asked , &quot; why do you conduct like this ? &quot;
audience : itay talgam : why not together ?
this is very exciting for those players .
did you see lenny &apos;s face ?
yet , when we take a step back , and look over the span of history , at what we might call the petroleum interval , it &apos;s a short period in history where we &apos;ve discovered this extraordinary material , and then based a whole way of life around it .
we had stories like &quot; the seven-league boots &quot; : the giant who had these boots , where , once you put them on , with every stride you could cover seven leagues , or 21 miles , a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal .
what i &apos;m involved with is the transition response .
there was a degree of resilience , if you like , at that time , which we can now only look back on with envy .
but actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively .
and by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us , and that the oil age has done for us , we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient , more nourishing , and in which , we find ourselves fitter , more skilled and more connected to each other .
now how did we get here ?
they sell off the revenues from tobacco .
everybody has an opinion .
a few weeks ago , i saw a video on youtube of congresswoman gabrielle giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets .
there &apos;s a beautiful quote by the romantic german composer robert schumann , who said , &quot; to send light into the darkness of men &apos;s hearts , such is the duty of the artist . &quot;
now , i know my clock doesn &apos;t tell you the exact time , but it does give you a general idea using a flower .
now , for a period of three years , i gathered data , not just me but also some of my friends , and i used to teach in university , so i forced my -- i mean , i asked my students to do this as well .
it &apos;s the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time .
jinsop lee : design for all 5 senses
&quot; hurray ! my boy finally started to lie ! &quot;
when kids are on the beach , most of them love playing in the water .
but kids , usually they do art for fun . it &apos;s playing .
works like this were hung in basel while i was punished and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth .
or some people dance in clubs .
students at first wonder whether they can actually do it , but later they have so much fun . i rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play .
they came to earth briefly transformed to stop you from being artistic , from becoming artists .
in 1990 , she was asked this question .
the greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century .
i had been using the first line of the nasa mission statement , &quot; to understand and protect the home planet , &quot; to justify my talks .
climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change .
methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost .
now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple , honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100 percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis , with the government not keeping one dime .
top climate scientist james hansen tells the story of his involvement in the science of and debate over global climate change . in doing so he outlines the overwhelming evidence that change is happening and why that makes him deeply worried about the future .
we couldn &apos;t do them without technology .
rolling a car over is another area where we use technology .
and that &apos;s interesting because they are almost retrospective .
they first dropped some dummies .
and it &apos;s made of polyethylene , so it &apos;s very thin .
we expect , and others expect , that perhaps the faa , the caa might say , &quot; you need to put someone in a suit that &apos;s not inflated , that &apos;s connected to the aircraft . &quot;
so what is a glacier ?
then you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings .
it &apos;s been frozen in the ice for over 100 years , and it &apos;s just now starting to sprout .
and the third part of this is that we &apos;ve all agreed , nonetheless , on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation . i mean , sirena last night was a marvel , wasn &apos;t she ? just seeing what she could do .
what these things have in common is that kids will take a chance .
art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance . there isn &apos;t an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics . why ?
and i think we can &apos;t afford to go on that way .
people weren &apos;t aware they could have that .
now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves , before others can laugh with us .
and ideas du bon marche .
these comics are now going to the new york festival .
let &apos;s start with leukemia , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , all , the most common cancer of children .
heart disease seems far more serious .
when we talk about the brain , it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic .
if we waited until the heart attack , we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease .
how many children will you get ?
i mean like once i pick up one book i cannot put it down until i finish the whole book .
we &apos;ve started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school .
we didn &apos;t hire mckinsey to do a business plan .
anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough ; anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet .
and finally , he had a breakthrough . vlasic pickles came to him , and they said , &quot; mr. moskowitz -- doctor moskowitz -- we want to make the perfect pickle . &quot; and he said , &quot; there is no perfect pickle ; there are only perfect pickles . &quot;
let &apos;s see if they congregate around certain ideas .
what percentage of you actually like a dark , rich , hearty roast ?
mustard does not exist on a hierarchy .
and that &apos;s what would please the maximum number of people .
he got traded a couple of times , he ended up in the minors for most of his career , and he actually ended up in management . he ended up as a general manager of the oakland a &apos;s .
we all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms for decades until all of a sudden we realized , because a study came out , a big one , nih-funded .
but you can actually perversely tell people to come , convince them that they have to come .
so , dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius , rocket scientist , inventor .
what it comes down to , really , is four basic principles : learn from everyone , follow no one , watch for patterns , and work like hell .
and this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics , but i was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms , and i found some in history .
and that &apos;s what i proposed : that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas : along the x axis and the y axis and staircases .
because what you &apos;re looking at is , you &apos;re looking at comics cubed : you &apos;re looking at comics that are more comics-like than they &apos;ve ever been before .
now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language .
now whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of stewart &apos;s viewers , the larger point remains that stewart &apos;s material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts -- not because his intent is to inform . it &apos;s not .
not to mention what it reveals about the adult who &apos;s speaking them .
not for god , not for country , not for profit -- just as a basic metric for global decision-making .
it was written by russell baker , who used to write an &quot; observer &quot; column in the new york times .
that &apos;s because the art of serious play is about invention , change , rebellion -- not perfection .
i spent most of the &apos; 80s being quite solemn , turning out these sorts of designs that i was expected to do because that &apos;s who i was , and i was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead , and getting rediscovered all over again .
so , it was a rough -- it was a rough go , but i fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because i didn &apos;t know what i was doing .
and then i spent a year going to long , tedious , boring meetings , trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears .
well , philip anderson may have been right .
their other name , mola mola , is -- it sounds hawaiian , but it &apos;s actually latin for millstone , and that &apos;s attributable to their roundish , very bizarre , cut-off shape .
so being a loner is a great thing , especially in today &apos;s seas , because schooling used to be salvation for fishes , but it &apos;s suicide for fishes now .
we &apos;re tagging on the california coast , and we &apos;re tagging over in taiwan and japan .
well , not the one we tagged !
and they &apos;re hitting a layer down there ; it &apos;s called the deep scattering layer -- which a whole variety of food &apos;s in that layer .
leds are smaller , they &apos;re cheaper , they &apos;re longer lasting , they &apos;re more efficient .
you guys were amazing .
just then , with a loud bang , the heavens opened .
you know , i have told this story close to 550 times , in audiences in 40 countries , to school students , to black-tie dinners at the smithsonian , and so on and so forth , and every time it hits something .
so , what do they do ?
one , two , three , four folds we make .
too small for detection , it &apos;s your built-in protection .
so , something has got to give . and that is what i want .
this was a perfect introduction .
when rca said no , that &apos;s when they decided to build it in princeton , where freeman works at the institute .
so they really were working under tough conditions .
they have to have something .
sadly , in the next 18 minutes when i do our chat , four americans that are alive will be dead from the food that they eat .
fact : diet-related disease is the biggest killer in the united states , right now , here today .
i wanted to put heart and soul and people , your public , around the statistics that we &apos;ve become so used to .
we &apos;re not geared up to do this .
it ain &apos;t happening , hasn &apos;t happened for 30 years , ok ?
there &apos;s a problem : if you &apos;re not a food expert , and you &apos;ve got tight budgets and it &apos;s getting tighter , then you can &apos;t be creative , you can &apos;t duck and dive and write different things around things .
jo : what do you think this is ? i don &apos;t know .
and i &apos;ve taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar , just from milk .
so , these guys are going to be part of the solution .
the kitchen is 25 grand a month . okay ?
we are everyone . we are no one .
but one thing is true : we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle for control of the internet .
because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry , we have a definite lack of -- call me old-fashioned -- human intelligence .
and he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on sprees in new york , taking out $ 10,000 from an atm here , $ 30,000 from an atm there , using cloned credit cards .
born in southern germany to a stable and well-respected middle class family , his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking .
and most of them , with the exception of script and cha0 , they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world -- only on the web .
so whether it &apos;s redeveloping dying malls or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots , i think the fact is the growing number of empty and under-performing , especially retail , sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least-sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places .
i think it is .
it &apos;s keeping the lights on .
when metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site , the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new main street , several apartments and condo buildings , while keeping the existing office buildings .
it &apos;s providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle .
this is another re-greening example .
now , retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism , and not without reason ; you don &apos;t get much more phony than an astroturf town green .
women go days , weeks , months , without looking at it .
but this wave started , and if i question the wave , or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave , i often have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck breaking . but if i go with the wave , and i trust the wave and i move with the wave , i go to the next place , and it happens logically and organically and truthfully .
i have seen terrible , terrible , terrible violence .
and the entire 2,000 people went absolutely crazy .
and she said , two days before the house opened , two different people arrived to give her a goat each , and she said to me , &quot; i knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in africa . &quot;
his name was sandor teszler .
which , as chance would have it , was spartanburg , south carolina , the location of wofford college .
and i delighted him by rejecting &quot; cavalleria rusticana &quot; in favor of bela bartok &apos;s &quot; bluebeard &apos;s castle . &quot;
&quot; live each day as if it is your last , &quot; said mahatma gandhi .
the exhibition was designed to be an experience , and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs .
i frequently go out into the hall and the galleries and i watch our visitors coming in .
but we take the severe ones , and we reschedule the other ones the next day .
you &apos;re also running a civil society .
but we try to stand on our feet , to do something , little things , we can for our people .
everything i &apos;m going to present to you was not in my textbooks when i went to school .
almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn &apos;t enter it until after neil armstrong and buzz aldrin went to the moon .
it was amazing . these giant chimneys , huge giant chimneys .
the ph of 11 , and yet it had chemosynthetic bacteria living in it and at this extreme environment .
we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their dna .
we need to be not only proud of our universities .
it &apos;s a machine learning class , and it has 400 people enrolled every time it &apos;s offered .
baby shannon -- you can see her on the left -- is doing much better now , and ryan got a job by taking some of our courses .
sp : ... these four things . prospect theory , hyperbolic discounting , status quo bias , base rate bias . they &apos;re all well documented .
but this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems .
now , if two students in a class of 100 give the same wrong answer , you would never notice .
i beg to differ with mark twain , though .
thank you .
of course , by talking about science i also may , as i did the other night , incur the violent wrath of some scientists who were very upset with me .
not a caress , but a wave of pain .
&quot; for sale : white trash compactor . &quot;
i &apos;m able to see the contradiction that you may not be able to see .
i guess the more you matter the more space you take up , which explains the whole suv phenomenon .
but being too prepared doesn &apos;t leave room for the accidents to happen .
president george w. bush : whatever it costs to defend our security , and whatever it costs to defend our freedom , we must pay it .
moving on . number nine -- don &apos;t laugh -- aliens invade earth .
it wasn &apos;t really a research report ; it was a screed .
number seven : particle accelerator mishap .
but the thing that &apos;s alarming is a couple of months ago , in mexico , where bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal , they found bt corn genes in wild corn plants .
we need to learn how to repair and replenish the earth &apos;s ozone layer .
the bubonic plague in europe , in the middle ages , killed one out of four europeans .
and also , space is incredibly vast .
of more concern , i think , is the asteroids that exist between mars and jupiter .
when the mission was over , they actually landed on the thing .
that was it .
some people have estimated that the biomass tied up in these microbes living in the pours and the cracks of the sea floor and below rival the total amount of living biomass at the surface of the planet .
on the left hand side there is a large volcano called axial seamount .
when earthquakes take place , massive amounts of these new microbes we &apos;ve never seen before come out of the sea floor .
it &apos;s based on wonder .
so again , radical versus conservative .
but the computer should not just be the glove of the hand ; the hand should really be the driver of the computing power .
it &apos;s not something that comes to us from books and theories .
so that is indeed what is memory .
world without risk would not be worth living .
i think nothing good will come out of that .
one is that , even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars , you &apos;re still better off .
let &apos;s show that second video showing the tesla in action on ice .
you &apos;ve been working on this solar company solarcity .
it &apos;s no money down , and your utility bill decreases .
all right , so let &apos;s go back to another bet that you made with yourself , i guess , a kind of crazy bet .
but the big innovation is still ahead , and you &apos;re working on it now . tell us about this .
we dressed a cowboy as johnny cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket .
but when you want to do something new , you have to apply the physics approach .
most people that are following the story of angelina jolie and brad pitt will know where namibia is .
and as a result , we were fined and locked up in jail .
do you have anybody in your communities , or people , that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well ?
these were our own people .
they stay very much far away because this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals .
i want to know how they rely on the water &apos;s bounty for their living .
we are hiding that cost behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines .
dan barber and alice waters are leading passionately the green food delicious revolution .
shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char -- these were the common species .
it &apos;s disgusting .
ice is the canary in the global coal mine .
they are powered by the sun . solar panels power them .
we have a site on google earth that google earth was generous enough to give us , and so forth , because we feel very much the need to tell this story , because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now .
this is a view of what &apos;s called the calving face .
but in any case , there are big , big changes happening as we speak .
you can see this river being formed .
i &apos;ll show you one of those in a second .
because i believe we have an opportunity right now .
you must have gotten your education here . &quot;
so within the company , there &apos;s no difference in the forward citation rates of their indian subsidiaries versus their u.s. subsidiaries .
what we are trying to say is that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder , you -- it &apos;s a self-perpetuating act , because of the sinking skill ladder , and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that you can &apos;t be an investment banker without having been an analyst once .
featuring the vocals and mischievous bell-playing of accordionist and singer rachelle garniez , the house band -- led by thomas dolby on keyboard -- delivers this delightful rendition of the edith piaf standard &quot; la vie en rose . &quot;
and i noticed that they would move this little thermoregulatory device to change the temperature in their home by one degree or two degrees .
there was clustering .
and then a bunch of community activities for changing norms .
so anyway , additionally , there was still this problem , and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems .
best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment , births , strokes , heart disease , hip replacements , 4 a.m. emergencies .
results vary , of course . this is pretty typical .
and no , i don &apos;t know how it works into the whole puzzling scheme of things , but obviously i know a coded message when i see one .
rives : the 4 a.m. mystery
and out in the cytoplasmic soup we have special proteins that are required for cell division that float freely in this soup in three dimensions .
gbm affects about 10,000 people in the u.s. each year .
and a year after that treatment , his tumor grew back with a vengeance .
lydia &apos;s a 66 year-old farmer in switzerland .
that means if an african child is born today , rather than three days ago , they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan .
and it &apos;s not just about african demographics .
so democracy is encouraging governments to invest in education .
actually , for the first 20 years , the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india didn &apos;t really grow .
the past decade has seen slow and steady economic growth across the continent of africa . but economist charles robertson has a bold thesis : africa &apos;s about to boom . he talks through a few of the indicators -- from rising education levels to expanded global investment -- that lead him to predict rapid growth for a billion people , sooner than you may think .
and they are building what i call the spinternet .
we tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships , but in many cases it only strengthens them .
i mean kgb , and not just kgb , used to torture in order to actually get this data .
growing up as a boy , we were taught that men had to be tough , had to be strong , had to be courageous , dominating -- no pain , no emotions , with the exception of anger -- and definitely no fear ; that men are in charge , which means women are not ; that men lead , and you should just follow and do what we say ; that men are superior ; women are inferior ; that men are strong ; women are weak ; that women are of less value , property of men , and objects , particularly sexual objects .
my brother , henry , he died tragically when we were teenagers .
he was home alone a lot .
he told me to go in his room .
so quickly , i &apos;d like to just say , this is the love of my life , my daughter jay .
and so i wondered , could what the future beckons for india to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else , the power of example , the attraction of india &apos;s culture , what , in other words , people like to call &quot; soft power . &quot;
if you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist , or a doctor or something , you might have a telephone .
they &apos;d often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back , then they &apos;d load the cart .
the same is true , of course -- we don &apos;t have time for too many more examples -- but it &apos;s true of our music , of our dance , of our art , yoga , ayurveda , even indian cuisine .
and the next one will be even bigger , because our voting population keeps growing by 20 million a year .
all of that is necessary , but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome .
so after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources i had , i went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . it &apos;s actually available on the market .
but i said we can &apos;t get rid of it , because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can &apos;t get rid of that immunity .
now , usually when i mention suspended animation , people will flash me the vulcan sign and laugh .
the next day , she was doing so well , they wanted to run tests on her .
you know ?
as i said , this agent is in us , and , in fact , here &apos;s a curious thing , it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds , and where you burn it , and that you do this burning to live .
if you give mice hydrogen sulfide , you can lower their demand for oxygen , and you can put them into oxygen concentrations that are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of mt . everest , and they can sit there for hours , and there &apos;s no problem .
we hope not , or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common .
but now , if babies didn &apos;t look the way they do -- if babies looked like this , that &apos;s what we would find adorable , that &apos;s what we would find -- we would think , oh my goodness , do i ever want to hug that .
ok , so if you try the same exercise with kids , they have no embarrassment at all .
i &apos;m going to see how many of you at the back of the room can actually get those things onto the stage .
i suspect , actually , that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons &#91; for &#93; why we want to categorize new things very , very quickly .
okay . put down your pencils , as they say .
and then he did what &apos;s called the purdue creativity test .
through constant experimentation with materials , they developed a wide range of iconic solutions that we know today , eventually resulting in , of course , the legendary lounge chair .
so when designers are working on ideas , they can start building stuff whenever they want .
so when , as adults , we role-play , then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized .
the first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy .
you can be serious and play .
but then i got into stuff that i didn &apos;t love , like management . i am the world &apos;s worst manager , but i figured i should be doing it , because i was , after all , the president of the company .
richard st. john : success is a continuous journey
and i had this idea : if i could get 50 people to all do this same thing , sing their parts -- soprano , alto , tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world , post their videos to youtube , we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir .
and some younger members .
and it &apos;s a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first .
commendable : a site that allows parents to give their kids little badges for doing the things that parents want their kids to do -- like tying their shoes .
well that basically depends on the kind of values that you bring to bear to make these kinds of judgments .
even if we choose to be silent , we chose to be silent . we &apos;re communicating something by choosing to be silent .
i think that all of these things are eventually informed by the core of all of this -- and this is nothing but life itself .
here , an overhead video camera is recording me as i &apos;m talking and drawing on a piece of paper .
of course , we couldn &apos;t have a classroom discussion with tens of thousands of students , so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums .
and this is a spearing mantis shrimp , or stomatopod .
so what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second all the way up to 23 meters per second .
and we went back to those high-speed videos again , and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending .
so these are actually some old data where i had to find the smallest animals in the lab , and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds generated by an animal about this big .
people have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn &apos;t cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it , just like these pictures show .
it &apos;s a well-established fact of these animals that they actually bluff . they can &apos;t actually strike , but they pretend to .
now , you &apos;re not as thick as two short planks , but you sound like it when you say &quot; earth , &quot; because that demonstration , if i turned around this way -- that earth plane would be as thin as paper .
now , go into the real atmosphere of this planet .
i &apos;m trying to do everything very gently .
we &apos;ve been just feet apart . i &apos;m going back down now . &quot;
we developed some other technology called spider optics , and craig ventner asked me to make an announcement here this morning : we &apos;re going to be building a beautiful , little , small version of this -- unmanned , super deep -- for his boat to go and get back some deep sea dna stuff .
let me demonstrate the strength of this approach .
we &apos;ve all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured .
third , a trajectory is planned that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball .
okay , here goes .
but in our comfortable , safe , crowded lands , we have few opportunities to exercise them without harming other people .
bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen and willow and cottonwood .
why would that possibly have happened ?
now , faced with opportunities like that , does it not seem a little unambitious to be thinking only of bringing back wolves , lynx , bears , beavers , bison , boar , moose , and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across europe ?
and perhaps this is the most important thing that rewilding offers us , the most important thing that &apos;s missing from our lives : hope .
and the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels , eelgrass and oysters -- species that live in the harbor -- and , at the same time , harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now .
finally , oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures .
so the water is churned through this raft .
and they would just kind of throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away , and of course it never really would go away .
it &apos;s in the middle of soho , in this working class neighborhood , this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool , that they still continue to have , despite the nuisances act , bordered on an extremely popular water pump , local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of soho , that all the residents from soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to .
it took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story , but by 1866 , when the next big cholera outbreak came to london , the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story , in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem .
the dalai lama lives in dharamsala , india .
and i usually hand out polaroids when i do these , because i &apos;m setting up lights , and checking my lights , and when i showed her her polaroid , she screamed and ran into her tent .
this is mengatoue .
this is daniel ; he &apos;s one of our students in arctic village , alaska .
this is an old mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather .
you hear about mars , it &apos;s a problem communicating to mars because it takes light long enough to go there .
and it &apos;s maturing up to the present time .
so if that &apos;s your responsibility , how are you going to do that ?
now we &apos;re going to zoom back out , and you can see this structure that , when we get very far out , looks very regular , but it &apos;s made up of a lot of irregular variations .
so you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point , now four times smaller , and so forth .
so that &apos;s where we are today , and that &apos;s what i wanted to give you a flavor of .
now as i was there , i guess , like a lot of people , i assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind .
it &apos;s familiarizing ourselves with the present moment .
don &apos;t be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that .
now , i still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism , seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole .
or , what if instead of relying on myself , i had to rely on other people to create the content for the art ?
it turned out to be about life , and having life skills .
the women in the zone , now in their 70s and 80s , are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and , it would seem , common sense , and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone .
pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes , their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka .
now radiation or not , these women are at the end of their lives .
so what happened ?
and he says he doesn &apos;t want to interrupt his colleagues because , he says , &quot; they &apos;re too busy on their email . &quot;
and what i &apos;m seeing is that people get so used to being short-changed out of real conversation , so used to getting by with less , that they &apos;ve become almost willing to dispense with people altogether .
and i believe it &apos;s because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable .
but in the process , we set ourselves up to be isolated .
create sacred spaces at home -- the kitchen , the dining room -- and reclaim them for conversation .
i coined my own definition of success in 1934 , when i was teaching at a high school in south bend , indiana , being a little bit disappointed , and delusioned perhaps , by the way parents of the youngsters in my english classes expected their youngsters to get an a or a b. they thought a c was all right for the neighbors &apos; children , because the neighbors children are all average .
you &apos;d hope they &apos;d both be good , but they won &apos;t necessarily be the same .
later on i said certain things -- i had -- players , if we &apos;re leaving for somewhere , had to be neat and clean .
it &apos;s something like this : and i had blocks in the pyramid , and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm , working hard and enjoying what you &apos;re doing , coming up to the apex according to my definition of success .
and so the fates are seldom wrong , no matter how they twist and wind .
but i &apos;d want one that could play , too .
so i consider them to be as successful as lewis alcindor or bill walton , or many of the others that we had , there was some outstanding -- some outstanding players .
and that really has to do to many different challenges .
so they know what to do .
and we then can re-perfuse the liver with cells , preserving the blood vessel tree .
i don &apos;t know if you realize this , but 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list are actually waiting for a kidney .
i &apos;m going to share with you a clip in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while .
i know i was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery .
now you may have noticed there &apos;s a new sector emerging called swap-trading .
that &apos;s what happened to me when i noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators , to highly enabled collaborators .
from morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food , we are consuming and collaborating once again .
the average car costs 8,000 dollars a year to run .
now all of these systems require a degree of trust , and the cornerstone to this working is reputation .
and i finished high school . and just walking , i found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the united states .
i &apos;m using the knowledge i received from the united states and from my community to move them forward .
it had become a community gathering place overnight .
mo : i can donate three water heaters , but someone needs to come pick them up .
mo : the tools . large aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear after a disaster , but they often fulfill very specific missions and then they leave .
co : and we needed help .
no matter how good an aid organization is at what they do , they eventually have to go home .
and i was thinking this morning of the good life , and before i show you the rest of my presentation , i &apos;m going to violate ted rules here , and i &apos;m going to read you something from my book as quickly as i can .
once atop the pile , one of the boys lowered his shorts , squatted , and defecated .
people dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs .
people burn trash to get rid of the garbage , and they dig their own sewer channels .
this woman is nine , which means &quot; grandma &quot; in turkish .
in fact , i think they &apos;re putting up my grade six report .
it &apos;s a blind computer .
but in 1989 , he teamed up with bill joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the net or from what was on the computer .
for example , in spain , there are a 100,000 accessible books in spanish .
unless we do something to prevent it , over the next 40 years we &apos;re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale .
the person that we would all acknowledge as her 20th-century counterpart , yogi berra , agreed .
we are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place .
to tell you the kinds of societal challenges that are going to come up in the new machine age , i want to tell a story about two stereotypical american workers .
i did a little bit of research on this notion , and it might calm some folk down to know that the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income has been championed by those frothing-at-the-mouth socialists friedrich hayek , richard nixon and milton friedman .
we could send congress on an autonomous car road trip .
and one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
let &apos;s sell pirate supplies . &quot; this is the pirate supply store .
and we found ourselves full every day with kids .
and we make it incredibly easy to volunteer .
the kids will work harder than they &apos;ve ever worked in their life if they know it &apos;s going to be permanent , know it &apos;s going to be on a shelf , know that nobody can diminish what they &apos;ve thought and said , that we &apos;ve honored their words , honored their thoughts with hundreds of hours of five drafts , six drafts -- all this attention that we give to their thoughts .
if you want to take on the identity of sharon boone , one american female marketing executive from hoboken , new jersey . it &apos;s a full dossier on everything you would need to know about sharon boone .
leeches . mammoth chunks . they even have their own slurpee machine : &quot; out of order . come back yesterday . &quot;
and most people , both within and outside the organized church , still have a picture of a celestial controller , a rule maker , a policeman in the sky who orders everything , and causes everything to happen .
some have concluded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain .
does god have a plan for each of us ? is god in control ?
it is not god that i do not accept .
in change and development and growth .
only doubts and questioning and uncertainty .
it actually goes way back , and what i want to suggest is it goes a long way back .
the other thing that the early man invented was fire .
that &apos;s what life is : it &apos;s an information process that was restructuring and making new order .
i use the word &quot; want . &quot; technology wants .
but it may be a pretty good idea relocated into sustainable nuclear energy for electricity , instead of burning coal .
it &apos;s actually part of a very long story , a great story , that began billions of years ago .
i grew up with the sounds of war -- the staccato sounds of gunfire , the wrenching booms of explosions , ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens .
seventy-five percent of them are women and children .
we must have a full picture of what that means .
she said , &quot; but what i worry about the most is not any of that .
but i think it does matter which way we go , and what road we take , because when i think about design in the near future , what i think are the most important issues , what &apos;s really crucial and vital is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now in 2002 .
i wondered about the infinity and the big bang theory .
let me say it again another way : science provides an understanding of a universal experience , and arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience .
regardless of how we look at this , whether we look at arts and sciences are separate or different , they &apos;re both being influenced now and they &apos;re both having problems .
fran lebowitz , my favorite cynic , she said the three questions of greatest concern , now i &apos;m going to add on to design , is , &quot; is it attractive ? &quot;
and she has this show , &quot; the simple life . &quot;
last year at ted , these were all my titles . i had a lot of titles .
when you have mentors -- and yesterday , kareem abdul-jabbar talked about mentors , these people in your life -- the problem with mentors is that they all die .
lastly , this is a fall-based calendar , because i have so many leaves in my yard .
so i focused on food as my area -- these sort of clementine peel things .
but i realized that life could be very boring , so i &apos;ve been thinking about life , and i notice that my camera -- my digital camera versus my car , a very strange thing .
basically , it always depends .
they have so many thoughts , and they have so much wisdom , and i think -- you know , this ted thing , i &apos;ve come here .
let me show you these slides here .
what is missing is a sense of urgency .
you &apos;ve seen this slide before , but there &apos;s a change .
ag : the answer to the question is hard for me because , on the one hand , i think that we should feel really great about the fact that the republican nominee -- certain nominee -- john mccain , and both of the finalists for the democratic nomination -- all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis . all three have offered leadership , and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration . and i think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals . but the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the league of conservation voters , by the way , the analysis of all the questions -- and , by the way , the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the orwellian label , &quot; clean coal . &quot; has anybody noticed that ?
a new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge .
and keith has come , and also jonathan has come and many others .
in this particular case a section will be devoted to information design .
again , this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today .
and i was watching the news one night in oxford .
how do we explain this ?
either we &apos;re back where we started and the surge has had no effect ; or finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent that we can start to think about maybe moving out .
there is something more though that has to be there .
meanwhile , the rich man thinks to himself , &quot; i &apos;m an idiot . god wants bread ?
the worst part was that she had allodynia , the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch .
it &apos;s successful , as you can see from this video of chandler , who , two months after we first met her , is now doings a back flip .
now , not all asteroids are that big .
and again , this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we &apos;re sitting in .
we &apos;re building telescopes that are looking for the threat . that &apos;s a great first step , but what &apos;s the second step ? the second step is that we see one heading toward us , we have to stop it . what do we do ?
you can try to -- you know , if you watch the movies , you might think about , why don &apos;t we use a nuclear weapon ?
it generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand , incredibly light , but it can run for months and years , providing that very gentle push .
so they &apos;re deprived of understanding their reality .
he was running a media systems organization which is still in business , the gentleman is still in business .
and basically what i was saying is very simple .
first independent newspaper in slovakia .
what is most important is we do it either in form of loans , equities , lease -- whatever is appropriate for , you know , supporting anybody .
so what the governor got was an empty shell .
instead of all of that we thought there is -- something new needs to be invented .
once you have all of that put together , there &apos;s not one reason why you couldn &apos;t actually have a marketplace for all of that , where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way .
somewhere in some other planet , orbiting some very distant star , maybe in a another galaxy , there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are , and are interested in science . it &apos;s not impossible ; i think there probably are lots .
and in a lot of familiar cases , they of course are .
symmetry is very important in this discussion .
mathematics very similar , but there was a whole new symmetry .
the fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another , and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply the phenomenon of the next skin .
whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication , is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement , but with serenity .
and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide .
knowing that tolstoy was in their midst , they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history .
fabulous , colorful , anecdotal stories .
despite all that power , all that wealth , he was alone when he finally died -- his ultimate terror realized .
because at first , i &apos;d be so excited i would blurt out , &quot; the dodgers won ! &quot; or , &quot; the dodgers lost ! &quot;
when i open my eyes and i see my sons in the place where my father once sat , i feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see , but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories i have told .
and that very night cyrus , king of the persians , entered babylon and the whole regime of belshazzar fell .
what was going on was the fundamental shift in middle eastern history .
after alexander , the other empires , babylon declines , falls into ruins , and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a british museum exhibition digging in babylon .
because interestingly , of course , cyrus is a good iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts .
this is the other side of that same picture .
a clay cylinder covered in akkadian cuneiform script , damaged and broken , the cyrus cylinder is a powerful symbol of religious tolerance and multi-culturalism . in this enthralling talk neil macgregor , director of the british museum , traces 2600 years of middle eastern history through this single object .
the head nurse told me proudly , &quot; you see , our children are very well-behaved . &quot;
if the family &apos;s poor , they find it difficult to visit , and gradually the relationship breaks down .
i was told i was dyslexic .
and the reason why 21 was the number is 700 men left , 23 came back , two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground .
and working with ngos and building this case .
and that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways , because it couldn &apos;t not work .
there was an interest in what was going on .
and on the 21st of september this year , we &apos;re going to launch that campaign at the o2 arena to go for that process , to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities .
thank you .
that &apos;s because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body .
take rodents and primates , for instance : in larger rodent brains , the average size of the neuron increases , so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons .
and it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same , an average of six calories per billion neurons per day .
so cooking frees time for us to do much more interesting things with our day and with our neurons than just thinking about food , looking for food , and gobbling down food all day long .
i started a collaboration with a friend of mine , bart hess -- he doesn &apos;t normally look like this -- and we used ourselves as models .
fellow lucy mcrae is a body architect -- she imagines ways to merge biology and technology in our own bodies . in this visually stunning talk , she shows her work , from clothes that recreate the body &apos;s insides for a music video with pop-star robyn , to a pill that , when swallowed , lets you sweat perfume .
i was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions .
and so the following day , i went to the orthopedic center .
i was doing something that i was not supposed to do .
inside , all of us panting , i sat a moment and i heard rafi telling his father , &quot; father , you can run faster than me . &quot;
i don &apos;t want them to be teased at school by the other students . &quot;
the production was up 20 percent .
and it &apos;s easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability .
well now you should see me .
another time , she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had .
and so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters .
and ghana was not paying enough attention .
it &apos;s the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university .
for one thing , we can determine that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star .
happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces .
indeed , the whole container .
good bye . &quot;
he &apos;s saying to me , &apos; electricity . &apos; was he an electrician ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
she gives you the names of your guardian angels , that &apos;s first .
all the more reason to take the million dollars , wouldn &apos;t you think , sylvia ?
now that is true . that is what homeopathy is all about .
largely , it &apos;s the media who are to blame for this sort of thing .
in the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine .
but the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater trying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient , to keep her patient asleep .
now if you don &apos;t have power , or , god forbid , the power cuts out in the middle of surgery , this machine transitions automatically , without even having to touch it , to drawing in room air from this inlet .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
the akan of people of ghana and &#91; cote d &apos;ivoire &#93; developed adinkra symbols some 400 years ago , and these are proverbs , historical sayings , objects , animals , plants , and my favorite adinkra system is the first one at the top on the left .
i write about food . i write about cooking .
we didn &apos;t know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility .
and guess what ?
there was no snack food , and until the &apos; 20s , until clarence birdseye came along , there was no frozen food .
the south and west became agricultural hubs , and in other parts of the country , suburbs took over farmland .
now , someone had to eat all that stuff , so we got fast food .
all you do is nuke it . what could be better ?
but listen : experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week .
about a year ago , i asked myself a question : &quot; knowing what i know , why am i not a vegetarian ? &quot;
if you want to take it to the next level , remember , the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats .
so you can take a picture with an iphone and get all the names , although , again , sometimes it does make mistakes .
well , he had all these wonderful little golden apples , and she &apos;d run ahead , and he &apos;d roll a little golden apple .
i think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem .
i said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have .
suppose we fixed these things -- we did something about all of these .
forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature .
the ability to -- it &apos;s another interesting application that would have large social ramification , perhaps .
are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work ?
jh : and they &apos;re non-deterministic .
and all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom .
there are lots of things that appear .
the universe is in our mind , and our minds are in the universe .
and in that moment , i feel like a millionaire .
sometimes brian and i walk through the park with scarlett , and she rolls through the grass , and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude .
and so they &apos;re valuable . this is precious metals and gemstones .
the common theme -- what makes it origami -- is folding is how we create the form .
all of origami comes from that .
i could use that for a leg , an arm , anything like that .
or , really , any other kind of deer .
it &apos;s an artist &apos;s rendition , but it flew in a japanese telescope in 1995 .
and this stent folds down using an origami pattern , based on a model called the water bomb base .
it goes 150 miles an hour .
the 200,000-year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end , believe it or not , and that &apos;s why i talk about the &quot; end of men . &quot;
so they spread out all the census data , and what they found , the guy described to me as a shocker , which is that in 1,997 out of 2,000 communities , women , young women , were making more money than young men .
but that &apos;s not what an ideal leader is like now .
i mean they have much larger vocabulary .
&quot; who &apos;s the damn man ?
we have the charmless misanthrope .
but the point about the high bridge is that you have to have the confidence to know that you deserve to be on that bridge , that you have all the skills and experience you need in order to walk across the high bridge , but you just have to make the decision to take the first step and do it .
and also , there &apos;s way more cells in your brain than the number of straws in a typical haystack .
sr : so electricity is pretty fast , but we probably wouldn &apos;t be able to target it to just the specific cells that hold onto a memory , and we &apos;d probably fry the brain .
now to bring back to life the memory of that day , i remember that the red sox had just won , it was a green spring day , perfect for going up and down the river and then maybe going to the north end to get some cannolis , # justsaying .
xl : so all memory is sophisticated and dynamic , but if just for simplicity , let &apos;s imagine memory as a movie clip .
sr : for example , one group in our lab was able to find the brain cells that make up a fear memory and converted them into a pleasurable memory , just like that .
but this , for instance , shows that about 30 percent of the people surveyed in the united states since 1956 say that their life is very happy .
and he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself .
there &apos;s this focus that , once it becomes intense , leads to a sense of ecstasy , a sense of clarity : you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other ; you get immediate feedback .
where do you come from ?
and i &apos;d always felt this way , but it really came home to me , as it were , some years ago when i was climbing up the stairs in my parents &apos; house in california , and i looked through the living room windows and i saw that we were encircled by 70-foot flames , one of those wildfires that regularly tear through the hills of california and many other such places .
or edinburgh .
it was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening .
thank you .
instead , i have progressed , and i am , today , launching a brand new analog teaching technology that i picked up from ike this box .
and the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago .
what has happened ? i start the world . here we go .
the world &apos;s population will grow to 9 billion over the next 50 years -- and only by raising the living standards of the poorest can we check population growth . this is the paradoxical answer that hans rosling unveils at ted @ cannes using colorful new data display technology .
but an association : the higher people &apos;s blood levels of vitamin d are , the less heart disease they have , the less cancer .
and i then moved back to edinburgh .
one of the subjects here was my mother-in-law , and clearly i do not know her age .
so if you &apos;re on the equator , december or june , you &apos;ve got masses of no being released from the skin .
in the front , you see , actually , joe murray getting the patient ready for the transplant , while in the back room you see hartwell harrison , the chief of urology at harvard , actually harvesting the kidney .
salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate .
it &apos;s actually a smart biomaterial that we used , to actually treat this patient .
and what we do is we , to make a blood vessel , same strategy .
and i &apos;m sure everyone here wanted an extra-large . right ?
now you can see it start . we &apos;re injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver .
some of the work you saw today was performed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20-year time span .
anthony atala : see , at the end of the day , the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise .
our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs .
but as an entrepreneur you don &apos;t do accounting , you hire accountants .
i even knew at a seven-year-old age that i could actually get a fractional percent of a cent , and people would pay that because it multiplied up .
he had all these old automotive parts lying around .
then i would go up and deliver them to these 70-year-old women playing bridge .
and i remember that lesson to this day .
then the money they get , 50 percent goes in their house account , 50 percent goes in their toy account .
given this rare opportunity to start fresh , they chose liberal arts as the most compelling model because of its historic commitment to furthering its students &apos; broadest intellectual , and deepest ethical potential .
in effect , civic-mindedness is treated as outside the realm of what purports to be serious thinking and adult purposes .
enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective .
the more powerful our reach , the more important the question &quot; about what ? &quot;
and there will be and should be those who spend a lifetime pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry .
okay , see ? it &apos;s done . it &apos;s almost done . here we go .
they recognize : both of these things have to live together .
and the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing .
indeed , mickey mouse himself , of course , as &quot; steamboat willie , &quot; is a remix of the then , very dominant , very popular &quot; steamboat bill &quot; by buster keaton .
that &apos;s number one . number two : this ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create .
and i felt like i was in third grade again .
and at one point , one of the girls who was sitting at his table , seeing what he was doing , leaned over and said to him , &quot; that &apos;s terrible . that doesn &apos;t look anything like a horse . &quot;
bandura calls this process &quot; guided mastery . &quot;
he would redesign the entire experience of being scanned .
but i decided and i committed to at this point to the thing i most wanted to do -- was to help as many people as possible regain the creative confidence they lost along their way .
if we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings , this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways .
they do this using principles of physics and chemistry , but they could also be using biology .
there &apos;s a new microbe , i just discovered it .
so this was before the computer was invented .
they had a 12-page supplement in the wall street journal the day it launched .
there was a guy called dick rowe who was at decca records and turned down the beatles .
so , in true web fashion they put together a poll where they had a bunch of very erudite , very thoughtful , cultured names .
and that was that the internet loves mister splashy pants .
in a funny , rapid-fire 4 minutes , alexis ohanian of reddit tells the real-life fable of one humpback whale &apos;s rise to web stardom . the lesson of mister splashy pants is a shoo-in classic for meme-makers and marketers in the facebook age .
i was allowed to use even traditional techniques .
the rain in burkina comes very fast , and after that , you have floods everywhere in the country .
they &apos;re a little bigger . they &apos;re a prototype .
voice : and who are these ? mt : ah , mischief-makers . watch .
thank you .
and you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as eastern china , which is where the vast majority of chinese lived then and live now .
but you can &apos;t run a country like china , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
it &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the west .
first , the west is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
welcome to the future . thank you .
the four corners of the world are watching , so travel daughter , travel .
i mean , technology , politics , business do change the world -- not always in a good way , but they do .
everyone was glued to the tv , watching disturbing , frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
they all accepted to be pasted next to the other .
people can tear it , tag on it , or even pee on it -- some are a bit high for that , i agree -- but the people in the street , they are the curator .
and she said , &quot; you know what ?
so they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them .
when the roofs were covered , a woman said as a joke , &quot; now god can see me . &quot;
we go back regularly .
when i do my work , i have two kinds of reactions .
the other thing that &apos;s worth considering is that we &apos;ve made a huge investment over decades and decades , and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance .
but they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company .
since i &apos;m here -- and i hope some people in the audience are in the car business -- -- i &apos;m thinking that , coming from the technology side of things -- we saw cable-ready tvs and wifi-ready notebooks -- it would be really great if , any minute now , you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off .
super fun , and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood .
the future will be more unpredictable .
there will be invisible capacity . invisible capacity in our bodies , in our brains , and in the air .
the employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people .
as globalization and technological advances bring us hurtling towards a new integrated future , ian goldin warns that not all people may benefit equally . but , he says , if we can recognize this danger , we might yet realize the possibility of improved life for everyone .
i would do birthday parties , weddings , divorces , anything for anyone who wanted to use my services .
what was , for me , a very naive observation , turned out to be a disaster .
here for example is a flamenco dancer , except there was one problem .
and he said , &quot; oh , it &apos;s very easy . i can teach you , but we &apos;re leaving the city , because billboard painters are a dying , extinct bunch of artists , because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them . &quot;
but this brought me -- with netra managing my career -- it brought me a lot of success .
&quot; no thank you , &quot; was more like it .
my mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation , and this man was elected president of this country .
raghava kk : my 5 lives as an artist
sw : yeah . she would get really , really excited .
e : &#91; operatic squawk &#93; sw : very good .
and we didn &apos;t think he &apos;d be in town then , so einstein wanted to do something special for him .
e : oink , oink , oink .
this whimsical wrap-up of ted2006 -- presented by einstein , the african grey parrot , and her trainer , stephanie white -- simply tickles . watch for the moment when einstein has a moment with al gore .
and that &apos;s what i want everyone in here to feel like , the incredible hulk , at the end of this presentation .
but actually rotating from streamlined right to streamlined left , maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible .
i couldn &apos;t believe i was on the other side of the world .
ended up doing translation work at age 16 when i returned to the u.s. , and have continued to apply this material over method approach to close to a dozen languages now .
&quot; okay , come on , grab me . &quot;
i &apos;m going to jump forward here .
apply them to very big dreams .
and all of this will be done within the public system , funded by public money , but independently run .
it doesn &apos;t animate them .
he &apos;s 6 foot 9 .
there &apos;s cavalry , men on horseback and with chariots .
so why do we keep calling david an underdog , and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable ?
so the most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly , and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone .
and this all came to a head when i was on a backpacking trip , my first one ever actually , on old rag mountain in west virginia , and was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog .
and somehow maybe the microbial community that &apos;s in and on me got off , and then this triggered some sort of immune response and led to me killing the cells that make insulin in my body .
i &apos;m sure many people here have heard about probiotics .
we even went to the international society of endocrinology meeting as family in quebec .
how popular we &apos;ve gotten to be -- we &apos;re a top 50 website and we &apos;re more popular than the new york times .
so a lot of people have heard about the wikipedia bush-kerry controversy .
by having this firm neutrality policy , which is non-negotiable from the beginning , we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don &apos;t become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right .
the tools and the software : there &apos;s lots of tools that allow us -- allow us , meaning the community -- to self-monitor and to monitor all the work .
nobody else saw this but i found it in a book , and i found a link to a page that describes it , and i &apos;m going to clean it up tomorrow , so please don &apos;t delete it , &quot; then it would survive .
but they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article .
and for a lot of people in the world , if i give you an encyclopedia that &apos;s written at a university level , it doesn &apos;t do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it .
but love isn &apos;t always a happy experience .
we found activity in a tiny , little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area .
you know , you &apos;re lying there , you &apos;re looking at the picture , and you &apos;re in this machine , and you &apos;re calculating , you know , what went wrong .
and she -- not only did the instant craving come back , but she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry .
i know what happens in the brain , when you do become in love , but i don &apos;t know why you fall in love with one person rather than another .
this is intimacy to women .
i would bring the branches home , riding buses and subways , barely holding them in my hands .
you need to console and communicate with the wood material .
now , atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species to work with for a couple of reasons .
they synchronize their sounds and their body postures to look bigger and sound stronger .
now this is video of a session .
well , chat is designed specifically to empower the dolphins to request things from us .
of course , electronic sensors have been around for some time , but something has changed : a sharp decline in the cost of sensors and , thanks to advances in cloud computing , a rapid decrease in the cost of storing and processing data .
st. luke &apos;s medical center in houston , texas , which has deployed industrial internet technology to electronically monitor and connect patients , staff and medical equipment , has reduced bed turnaround times by nearly one hour .
first , we &apos;ve already lived through mechanization of agriculture , automation of industry , and employment has gone up , because innovation is fundamentally about growth .
we will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks .
text : jetman - yves rossy grand canyon many of the tests are conducted while yves is strapped onto the wing , because yves &apos; body is an integral part of the aircraft .
and there were many , many others .
and i wanted to keep this freedom of movement .
my only instruments are &#91; an &#93; altimeter and time .
people have died trying to do this kind of thing .
yr : it was down on the bottom .
yves rossy : fly with the jetman
or so we should hope .
empiricism is inadequate because , well , scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen .
our connection to reality is never just perception .
it &apos;s equally testable .
it &apos;s a fact that is , itself , unseen , yet impossible to vary . thank you .
okay , so i &apos;ve made these glasses and ...
sydney , as i would learn , is a city of suburbs , and minto lies southwest , about an hour away .
case in point : when &quot; the sultan &apos;s elephant &quot; came to london just nine months after 7 / 7 , a londoner wrote , &quot; for the first time since the london bombings , my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice .
second doctor : we &apos;re gonna take this nice and easy , jake.first doctor : well , do you want to sit up ? that &apos;s fine .
i thought , my career &apos;s over .
these bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice .
and now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the north because of the lives that we &apos;re leading in the south .
i &apos;m with my swedish assistant and guide .
and she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like , &quot; are you for real ? &quot;
you just looked at your clock , right ?
did you see it go ?
it was to teach us parallax . do you remember ?
he wisely explains this to us . he says design thinking must tackle big systems for the challenges we have .
what he did was , he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before ? — he attached it to a tap . so effectively what you had was , you had a situation where — i &apos;ll try and draw the tap and the pipe , actually i &apos;ll skip the tap . the taps are hard .
you with me ? this point over here , the point at which the lines cross over , the pace of change overtakes the pace of learning , and for me , that is what i was describing when i was telling you about midnight .
but it was also the signal that capped the use , or overuse , of energy-consuming devices .
you can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun , as it moves across the surface , as well as the shade , each of the tiles moves individually .
i don &apos;t need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes .
ok . this is a bit of a problem .
that you find across cultures and even across species ?
it &apos;s about any kind of ideology , any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body , by controlling what you put into your body .
here &apos;s the data for 1,100 canadians .
of course , bosch called this hell .
the grand canyon is really simple .
the great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve .
well , if you take the greatest insights from ancient asian philosophies and religions , and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology , i think you come to these conclusions : that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams , to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth .
now there &apos;s a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs .
military personnel are being trained for war , so they &apos;re trained that , as soon as things go bad , their first response is lethal force .
in fact , if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at , the material they were collecting and examining , you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15 percent of cases where o.c. spray was used .
same police district .
apparently it can .
you &apos;re makers of food ; you &apos;re makers of shelter ; you &apos;re makers of lots of different things , and partly what interests me today is you &apos;re makers of your own world , and particularly the role that technology has in your life .
and he began building robots .
you could build your own satellite and get it into space for like 8,000 dollars .
this is the hewlett-packard garage .
architectural photography -- julius schulman , who has talked about transfiguration , took this fabulous , famous picture of the kauffman house .
this sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period , but because , in it &apos;s streamlining , it transports us from the everyday .
this is the most glamorous picture , i think , ever .
you know , we &apos;re marching toward utopia .
me was always trying to become something , somebody .
if i was tired , i drank more espressos .
i heard about a little girl who couldn &apos;t stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her .
and she died quietly in her favorite place .
it was a lot of anger , insane humor , a lot of attention , outrage .
so i &apos;m going to tell you three things about this today .
and so ivan goes to get a drink .
and he takes this one .
and actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds , getting into early adolescence , they still don &apos;t have quite an adult-like brain region .
and what you can see is , on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region , people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident .
thank you .
the notion that you can understand why a brain works , perhaps .
and of course , we used to date and now we speed date .
i wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture , and what it was doing to me and to everyone else .
now if you &apos;ll permit me a small act of hypocrisy , i &apos;ll just give you a very quick overview of what &apos;s going on inside the slow movement . if you think of food , many of you will have heard of the slow food movement .
the workplace .
and if any of you have ever driven on an italian highway , you &apos;ll have a pretty good idea of how fast i was going .
and i present myself as exhibit a , a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed-aholic .
and he said , &quot; no , no , no , daddy -- this is a card for being the best story reader in the world . &quot;
and here &apos;s the building as it opened , with a channel overlooking downtown , and as seen from downtown .
the pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands -- they &apos;re not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there .
and there are chambers carved in the rock -- concrete walls , stone , the natural rock when possible -- with the light shafts .
nevertheless , beauty as the kind of fit ; something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that .
everyone &apos;s listening . we &apos;re responding .
so jazz , this bandstand is absolutely amazing .
and pakistan , in this particular vein , is very similar .
indeed it is the emerging world &apos;s first hmo for the urban working poor .
i study fish , also the bigger things , whales and dolphins .
and one thing you need to know about dragonflies , one important thing , is that they lay their eggs in fresh water .
it &apos;s sort of dull-colored . and it &apos;s fairly common .
there is no surface fresh water .
are they coming from india against the wind ?
so , if you &apos;ve got india here , when the front is up above india you &apos;re into the southwest monsoon .
but they are incredibly good fliers . this particular species , it can fly for thousands of kilometers .
it &apos;s only half the length of this one .
it &apos;s known as the eurasian roller . in india it occurs in the northwest , so it &apos;s known as the kashmir roller .
oh , watch this .
okay , look at that . it &apos;s a darkslide .
you &apos;re on this gurney and you &apos;re watching the ceiling go by , every time it &apos;s always that , and right when they &apos;re putting the mask on you before you go to sleep , all i was thinking is , &quot; man , when i wake up and i get better , the first thing i &apos;m going to do is film that trick . &quot;
these are some of the best skaters in the world .
in fact , i &apos;ve had so much success that i strangely always feel unworthy of .
rodney mullen : pop an ollie and innovate !
and the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb .
in practice , the norden bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft . , but that &apos;s under perfect conditions .
so they had their own norden bombsight throughout the entire war -- which also , by the way , didn &apos;t work very well .
now what is the accuracy of those drones ?
you know , i guess the first question is , why build a virtual world at all ?
one is that if you went into space you &apos;d be able to begin again .
if anybody plays , like , world of warcraft , world of warcraft comes on , like , four dvds .
you know , mapping in india -- that &apos;s such a great example .
and i remember that that was just so telling , you know , that you didn &apos;t know exactly what was going to happen .
it doesn &apos;t seem to have its own culture , and the sort of differences that exist in the real world aren &apos;t translated into the second life map .
i suspect that &apos;s possibly a euphemism for c student who spent a lot of time in his room ? is it possible ?
and so i just came , two days ago , from the himalayas to your kind invitation .
but then , if you look in the literature , east and west , you can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness .
it is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment , a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states , and all the joys and sorrows that can come one &apos;s way .
so one evening , he said , &quot; look , you are doing all these things , but isn &apos;t it nice , also , to build something within ? &quot;
this is the nature . it cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because , then , if it was always there -- like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth -- then it would be found all the time , somewhere .
now , it takes time because we -- it took time for all those faults in our mind , the tendencies , to build up , so it will take time to unfold them as well .
the bell curve shows 150 controls , and what is being looked at is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe .
just this one example is worth a lot of work .
how long have we been divergent from each other ?
all dug up just west of here in olduvai gorge , by the leakey family .
how long is it ? well , it &apos;s billions of these subunits in length .
why didn &apos;t homo erectus evolve into separate species , or sub-species rather , human races around the world ?
probably , according to what many linguists believe , fully modern language , syntactic language -- subject , verb , object -- that we use to convey complex ideas , like i &apos;m doing now , appeared around that time .
the project launched in april 2005 .
first , a video .
and at each threshold , the going gets tougher .
we know above all that it was extremely simple .
the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile , significantly more vulnerable , but they &apos;re also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity .
but of course , life is more than just exotic chemistry .
sixty-five million years ago , an asteroid landed on earth near the yucatan peninsula , creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war , and the dinosaurs were wiped out .
and exploiting that energy , human populations multiplied .
backed by stunning illustrations , david christian narrates a complete history of the universe , from the big bang to the internet , in a riveting 18 minutes . this is &quot; big history &quot; : an enlightening , wide-angle look at complexity , life and humanity , set against our slim share of the cosmic timeline .
keep your hands up if you have sufficient life insurance .
they &apos;re just too lazy .
well that &apos;s at least what one wonderful study predicted .
not many people check boxes .
those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch .
mid-sized company in the midwest , blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they cannot save more right away .
one , two , three , four .
how early can a rock performance begin ?
i wanna talk to randi .
so i rethought the whole thing , and then we all came to a consensus .
you &apos;re looking for something that comes and hits you .
what does forever mean ?
i have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way , but i have the potential .
of course , when i asked cate blanchett , i said , &quot; what &apos;s the film about ? &quot;
elizabeth : this is no time for mercy , walsingham .
so the film is operating on many many levels in that scene .
but i can go on about telling you how we evolve stories , and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that i am in , which is film .
but do they call me macgregor the bar builder ? no . &quot;
and so if i were going to give you the ending of this story , it would go something like this : and that &apos;s what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at ted about story .
it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re damn cute ; it &apos;s because they can &apos;t completely express what they &apos;re thinking and what their intentions are .
but a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it .
but we really wanted to prove that you could tell stories completely different in animation .
who said your job was to think , spring wiener ?
thumper : come on . it &apos;s all right .
i promise , i will never let anything happen to you , nemo .
it &apos;s not the work i set out to do .
we were attacking the wrong driver .
it &apos;s not just about population , and it &apos;s not just about them ; it &apos;s about us .
okay , so let &apos;s be generous .
everybody &apos;s got to work together -- china and the u.s .
and if you go through the first 25 or 30 names of each of the commodities , what you begin to see is , gosh , there &apos;s cargill here , there &apos;s cargill there , there &apos;s cargill everywhere .
it can happen .
we don &apos;t have to change the way a single chinese company works if we get cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to china .
this is called bundling . it &apos;s bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity .
but how to make it happen ?
i was completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain , but at the same time so frustrated .
but the remaining question was , how ?
and my hope is that after several months of training , there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion without the robot , maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation .
i am an example of what &apos;s possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by the people around them .
the difference between a broken community and a thriving one is often the healthy respect between men and women who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society .
everything you need to succeed , you already have , right here .
i can &apos;t make noise .
people are less kind . there is less trust around .
so unusual , in fact , that it was said that it &apos;s not clear the internet could work .
this is a system that relies on kindness and trust , which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable .
something is up in pakistan . &quot;
apologies , andyvphil , if you &apos;re here today .
they just didn &apos;t think it was the right thing to do .
i even think it can go into the real world .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
so with pisa , we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly .
these countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all , a very important lesson .
remember , that was the year before the ipod was invented .
they took up the challenge , and korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading .
if you go to japan in asia , or finland in europe , parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed , and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior .
in the past , the policy focus was on outcomes , on provision .
and i think -- so i want to throw a perspective that i have , so that we can assess this project , or any other project , for that matter , to see whether it &apos;s contributing or -- contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it .
and to contrast that , you can see the most important institution in the world , the world bank , is an organization of the government , by the government , for the governments .
if you just multiply by 100 million people , let &apos;s say losing one day a month , whatever , and you see a vast amount of resource wasted .
so the question was , i started looking at this issue , and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york .
so for example , we didn &apos;t have ways to have credit checks , few banks to collect bills , etc .
you can see it &apos;s pretty much covered .
&quot; the poor are uneducated and cannot do much . &quot;
but in st. john &apos;s , i was in the lower quarter .
1858 was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of india was defeated by the british forces .
but really , really natural sovereignty was good for japan .
it was central planning by mao tse tung .
and if i would also look at india , you have another type of inequity , actually , in india .
and we shall see what will happen with these countries .
now , a historian tells me it &apos;s even more difficult to predict about the past .
so , recently , we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe -- and by ordinary matter , i mean you , me , the planets , the stars , the galaxies -- the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe .
so these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now , we take a snapshot in a decade , it &apos;ll look identical .
we extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here .
and again , this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing .
they &apos;re moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger , ok .
do we have anything for dark matter ? and the answer is yes .
physicist patricia burchat sheds light on two basic ingredients of our universe : dark matter and dark energy . comprising 96 % of the universe between them , they can &apos;t be directly measured , but their influence is immense .
sadly , it &apos;s come true . malaria , as we all know , kills approximately one million people a year .
and they are having great fun .
using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain , be faithful , and use condoms -- the abc campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years .
it &apos;s also important to think about what the benefit is .
if people have no incentive to avoid aids on their own , even if they know everything about the disease , they still may not change their behavior .
that suggests it &apos;s pretty similar levels of development .
areas with a lot of economic activity -- with a lot of roads , with a lot of urbanization -- those areas have higher prevalence than others .
but that &apos;s enormously important for policy .
spring .
we &apos;re not the first ones to make paper . we &apos;re not the first ones to try to optimize packing space , or to waterproof , or to try to heat and cool a structure .
so how does it keep its body free of bacteria build-up ?
it can be put down on any substrate whatsoever .
in our world we use about 350 polymers to make all this .
here &apos;s a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale .
and the scientists who are contributing to eol are answering a question , &quot; what can we learn from this organism ? &quot;
&quot; well , why ? &quot;
i don &apos;t know if he really meant &#91; that &#93; , but it happened .
because normally it was always said , power to detect , and that &apos;s it , or power to punish .
and then how did i deal with them ?
that &apos;s the second landmark .
secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in india .
let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of captcha .
so you start with a book , and then you scan it .
now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
and it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .
it was somebody who was trying to ask a question about javascript .
and so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
so the nice thing about duolingo is i think it provides a fair business model -- one that doesn &apos;t discriminate against poor people .
and it also delivers really fabulous innovation , and i &apos;ll talk about that later .
so i actually know a lot about building a peer platform now , and a peers , inc. company , because i &apos;ve spent the last two years doing that in paris .
you have these different fabulous owners and their different cars , different prices , different locations .
a decade ago , robin chase founded zipcar in the us , now the largest car-sharing company in the world . now she &apos;s exploring the next level of car-sharing : buzzcar , a french startup that lets people rent their own cars to others . the details are fascinating , and the larger vision points to a new definition of ownership and entrepreneurship .
what i &apos;d like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we &apos;ve been investigating , and that &apos;s mind-wandering .
so how could this be happening ? i think part of the reason , a big part of the reason , is that when our minds wander , we often think about unpleasant things , and they are enormously less happy when they do that , our worries , our anxieties , our regrets , and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral , they &apos;re still considerably less happy than when they &apos;re not mind-wandering at all .
when are humans most happy ? to gather data on this question , matt killingsworth built an app , track your happiness , that let people report their feelings in real time . among the surprising results : we &apos;re often happiest when we &apos;re lost in the moment . and the flip side : the more our mind wanders , the less happy we can be . &amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ;
and there , i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood .
they were chanting , &quot; we want peace .
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i &apos;m still searching for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better .
and the english set up cromwell and a whole bunch of republicans or whatever , and not the kind of republicans we had .
i mean , you want to call it godless , you know , you call it godless .
so if somebody could see it , you could say , here &apos;s how the machine works , here &apos;s what we do , and then here &apos;s what happens .
in fact , everybody in this room probably , especially if you picked up your bag -- some of you , i know , didn &apos;t pick up your bags -- but if you picked up your bag , everybody in this room has got in their pocket , or back in their room , something that 350 years ago , kings would have gone to war to have .
you sort of -- now you say , well , let &apos;s see if i can get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar , perchlorate and sugar , and heat it ; it would be interesting to see what it is they don &apos;t want me to do , and what it is going to -- and how is it going to work .
and we had not -- i mean , we weren &apos;t frightened by it .
one of the things that happened right around world war ii in that same time period before , and as sure as hell afterwards , government got -- realized that scientists aren &apos;t strange dudes that , you know , hide in ivory towers and do ridiculous things with test tube .
but nobody actually demonstrated it , right ?
there isn &apos;t a problem with global warming any longer , so we can -- you know , they &apos;re funding .
so let me put that in perspective for you and give you some context .
they just say , &quot; well , you have feet , here are your shoes . &quot;
susan solomon : the promise of research with stem cells
i decided against clothing because i wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications or time-specific elements .
&quot; naked city &quot; is a nickname for new york , and &quot; spleen &quot; embodies the melancholia and inertia that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment .
i saw the structure while i was on the train , and i got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement , which was used for ammunition storage during the war and also , at some point , to hide groups of jewish refugees .
i adapted and produced &quot; a dream play &quot; by august strindberg .
and if you can , just scribble a pattern .
and when we gave them a battery , and a piece of wire , and a bulb , and said , &quot; can you do it ? &quot; they couldn &apos;t do it . right ?
what would you do if you knew that people had this misconception , right , in their heads , of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children ?
so we &apos;re not empty vessels ; the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood .
i love to do synthetic biology .
but when i saw this , i was really fascinated , because it seemed lifelike .
but what does a cell do ?
the other thing we need to think about is the emergence of chemical complexity .
so these things together give us evolution , perhaps .
and that &apos;s really worth thinking about .
and we &apos;re really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive .
and by specifying eight different goals , the united nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people .
but they have good quality .
so what i &apos;m telling you is that we know the child mortality .
this was the backlash in kenya , and ghana bypassed , but then kenya and ghana go down together -- still a standstill in congo .
the nile delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease and malaria and a lot of problems .
come on . we want everyone down there .
we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don &apos;t stabilize the world population .
and what you said , lakshmi , is absolutely true : it &apos;s not just ratan tata , it &apos;s the house of tatas over time .
can you believe it ?
the length is smaller by eight percent by the way .
you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace , after all the human and animal testing , was 10 years , now it is 15 years .
i launched a big program &#91; unclear &#93; csir about nine years ago .
you know , incubators for infants , for example .
and then he said , &quot; this is the focal length . &quot;
my favorite and most successful app is bustin jieber , which is â   â   which is a justin bieber whac-a-mole .
thomas suarez : a 12-year-old app developer
but i &apos;m not really concerned about the fuel .
they love the neutrons that are going on and helping this reaction take place .
not only do you have 50 to 100 megawatts to power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there , but you have power once you get there .
so , we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy .
you know the words i mean ?
and now , with the experience economy , it &apos;s about rendering authenticity .
all right , now , there is value for fake .
and what you have done in the past limits what you can do , what you can get away with , essentially , in the future .
you know how much coffee is worth , when treated as a commodity as a bean ?
so that was how i first started to explore the way things moved , and expressed it .
i imagine what can be said with them .
what would i love ?
but then in the end , what i decided was every time you finish writing the word , i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road .
and the only place that collagen changes its structure is in the cornea of your eye .
but basically by the time you &apos;re nine months and you &apos;re given birth , you have almost 60,000 miles of vessels inside your body .
but you have it in planets and asteroids .
sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny , weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere .
now to go ahead with this , we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe .
it &apos;s exactly the same game . a very tiny feature .
if you suddenly observe technetium in a sun-like star , you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere , because in a natural way it is impossible to do this .
i &apos;m a qualitative researcher .
and all you can think about is that opportunity for growth , right ?
and that was , the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they &apos;re worthy of love and belonging .
they thought this was fundamental .
&quot; i just need some strategies . &quot;
and one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability .
there &apos;s no discourse anymore .
can i be this fierce about this ? &quot;
this kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device -- among early adopters at the moment -- the fitbit .
thank you .
sometimes , we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern and take pictures of that area , and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest .
but perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape , and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change , to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding , where forests might be contracting , or where fires might be breaking out .
that would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests .
and even though steven passed away three years ago we had an amazing journey as a family .
we need to give to others to be successful .
what i love about this , just sort of interesting design problems .
i can look at my constipation , how to manage it .
but the short story is : if you &apos;re a patient , you want to be on the blue line .
so , we did . we took all the patients like humberto , that &apos;s the apple background , we stole that because we didn &apos;t have time to build our own . this is a real app by the way .
you &apos;re actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly , but slightly worse . you don &apos;t want to be a lithium patient this time .
it only works about 12 months .
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s nothing normal about this .
imagine if we didn &apos;t have to rely on artificial lighting to get around at night .
being able to do that means that i can generate energy cleanly , efficiently and cheaply right where i am .
there &apos;s something much more interesting around the corner , &quot; i say , &quot; try saying that to her . &quot;
you encode it into equations .
what we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
and we already see signs of organization going on here .
there are 146 top players in the core , and they together have the potential to collectively control 40 percent of the tncs &apos; value .
they &apos;re flower-feeders , and as they move from flower to flower , basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart , they end up providing this valuable pollination service .
and more recently , we &apos;ve been studying resins that bees collect from plants .
since world war ii , we have been systematically eliminating many of the flowering plants that bees need for their survival .
and it &apos;s not just our honeybees .
at least in the united states , an average of 30 percent of all bee hives are lost every winter .
we bury them in the ground .
you shake it hard and it breaks apart .
so i know you &apos;re probably thinking , okay , that &apos;s cool , but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment ?
and if you have children , you &apos;ve seen this hundreds of times before .
now if you fall below the average on this curve , then psychologists get thrilled , because that means you &apos;re either depressed or you have a disorder , or hopefully both .
i was an officer of harvard to counsel students through the difficult four years .
your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative , neutral or stressed .
it &apos;s , like , you know , herbie the apple ii .
i found this book . it &apos;s called , &quot; thoughts on design , &quot; by a man named paul rand .
and i said , never .
this computer appears to be fast - she &apos;s working pretty hard , and people are running around , and we think , wow , this is happening at a fast rate .
and so , i began to think more carefully about the computer .
they &apos;re littler computers , so the one-chip computers , i began to program one-chip computers and make objects out of p.c. boards , leds .
and i also discovered how .
if i essentialize gender for you today , then you can dismiss what i have to say .
this makes university administrators very nervous , because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools that don &apos;t have boys .
and little moments in my life .
you &apos;ll see , the conversation changes depending upon who &apos;s sitting around the table .
most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards .
so we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways to change the attitudes so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms .
and according to the higgs theory , at that instant , a dramatic event took place in the universe .
we may not realize it in ordinary life , but the intensity of the higgs field is critical for the structure of matter .
theoretical physicists always ask &quot; why &quot; questions .
and that &apos;s what i say when people ask me what i do , but it really confuses most people , so really , the best way for me to convey it is to take the technology and be creative and create experiences .
so i got about 10 credit cards and loans and got myself very close to bankruptcy , really , and bought myself this huge printing press , which i had no idea how to use at all .
so a couple of things i &apos;ve created are , there &apos;s a poster over here that you can play drums on .
so instead , i turned to video , and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time .
this is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece called a point just passed , in which i project myself on top of a time card punch clock , and it &apos;s up to you .
still , we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we &apos;d all helped build in the air , off the ground , like it was supposed to be .
once they &apos;re fully deployed , there &apos;s a mechanical lock that goes into place , again , from inside the cockpit .
on average , there &apos;s one within 20 to 30 miles of wherever you are in the united states .
... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter .
they are absolutely disgusting and they &apos;re good for nothing . &quot;
what &apos;s fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera , but they prevent twice as many accidents .
and there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it .
yet we &apos;ve never created the opportunity for impulse saving .
which one did you prefer ? the first one .
i was spending all my time practicing .
now that , i suggest , is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously .
audience : chaos .
and what about , oh , i can &apos;t see any interesting memes here .
while their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy -- lighting fires , keeping fires going , new techniques of hunting , these kinds of things -- inevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair , or wearing strange clothes , or painting their faces , or whatever .
is there anyone else out there ?
my cat gave birth to four kittens , purring all the time .
sb : thank you . i scared myself .
we inspected government buildings .
they tied the rebar right , they poured the columns right , and that building will be safe .
now the penis isn &apos;t actually required for internal fertiliztion , but when internal fertilization evolves , penises often follow .
it has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid -- in this case blood -- surrounded by a wall of tissue that &apos;s rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen .
so i spent a long , long time thinking about it .
we often focus on one disease , one model , one problem , but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems and just see where it takes us .
and when i finished hurting people a little bit , i would ask them , so , how painful was this ? or , how painful was this ?
now , in economic theory , cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis .
turns out the people who tried to recall the ten commandments -- and in our sample nobody could recall all of the ten commandments -- but those people who tried to recall the ten commandments , given the opportunity to cheat , did not cheat at all .
our subjects doubled their cheating .
and at pittsburgh there are two big universities , carnegie mellon and university of pittsburgh .
i think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market .
thank you !
you tell them .
we &apos;ve got another 10 minutes .
i like it .
they too did not enjoy the privilege of college education .
so chip specifications , apis , project descriptions , software tools , hardware simulators , cpu emulators , stacks of hundreds of slides , lectures -- we laid out everything on the web and invited the world to come over , take whatever they need , and do whatever they want with it .
i &apos;m sick of it .
so presently , we are doing the following : first of all , we are decomposing the k-12 math curriculum into numerous such apps .
since 1996 , over five million people have died in the democratic republic of the congo .
recent u.k. legislation could be used in the same way .
you &apos;re going to have a busy lunchtime rush .
and they &apos;re looking at how many of the people they &apos;ve inducted are available each hour next week .
these mechanisms , these facilities are not in the gift of craigslist or gumtree or yahoo , they &apos;re controlled by the state .
and government has certain benefits it can uniquely bestow on these markets .
this kind of data can become routine .
the key question is , &quot; when are we going to get fusion ? &quot;
china is building nuclear power stations . everybody is .
but when you get them close enough , something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together .
this is a bit shocking , because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet kyoto , and do all those kind of things .
you can &apos;t . you have to do it in a very big device .
my talk today draws on this research to reveal why arabs rose up and what they want now .
eighty-eight percent said moving toward greater democracy would help muslims progress -- the highest percentage of any country we surveyed .
so while egyptians were known for their single-digit turnout in elections before the revolution , the last election had around 70 percent voter turnout -- men and women .
the answer is no .
we &apos;ve also found an unintended consequence .
the police did it . it used to be just guess work , police work .
i &apos;d like to tell you about a magical place called darpa where scientists and engineers defy the impossible and refuse to fear failure .
after 11 complete mission failures , we got our first images from space .
in the first flight , no aerodynamic control of the vehicle .
or perhaps , spider man will one day be gecko man .
and it is the first time that tim has held katie &apos;s hand in seven years .
they remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure .
and when he hit send , he probably didn &apos;t realize what a difference it would make .
but not necessarily just a camera ?
i mean , you &apos;re clearly a really inspiring leader .
while it &apos;s easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities , 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector , and so therefore we &apos;re equally , if not more , accountable .
but there &apos;s something missing in this wonderful tour : it &apos;s time .
so , it might not be enough .
and this giant information system can be searched in many ways .
it &apos;s difficult . one thing you can do is document each step of the process , not only coding the historical information but what we call the meta-historical information , how is historical knowledge constructed , documenting each step .
unfortunately , i cannot show their faces , neither can i disclose their true names , and that &apos;s because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates , offenders spending time in a correction facility about 20 minutes &apos; ride from here -- well , like everything in israel .
they happened in places like this , in the judean desert , 20 kilometers away from the nearest road .
and it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was misplaced , and that there was another vision supremely more important and more readily available .
and that &apos;s the point when you start loving yourself .
and the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me , and it &apos;s given me an insight into the whole notion of self , which i think is worth sharing with you today .
because the self likes to fit , to see itself replicated , to belong .
by 19 , i was a fully-fledged movie actor , but still searching for definition .
we &apos;d be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing .
i was in congo in february , dancing and celebrating with women who &apos;ve survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways -- destroyed because other brutalized , psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves &apos; addiction to ipods , pads , and bling , which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain , their suffering , their death .
this is a hospital building .
but instead of what it is , our focus was on the way it worked .
the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station .
but this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
there &apos;s just silence and a cool temperature .
they &apos;re just chopped at different heights .
there are also , i think , increasing results from the scientific study of humans that , indeed , we &apos;re not born blank slates .
the foremost is that if we &apos;re blank slates , then , by definition , we are equal , because zero equals zero equals zero .
well , the night is young , but the book has been out for half a year , and nothing terrible has happened .
students are staying away in droves , universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities .
now , here is -- here is a representative quote from a besieged mother : &quot; i &apos;m overwhelmed with parenting advice .
i have my own answer to that question , which comes from a great artist of the 19th century , anton chekhov , who said , &quot; man will become better when you show him what he is like . &quot;
ok , that &apos;s basically how you do it .
we can &apos;t do this . &quot;
albert instructs , &quot; push it way up there . &quot;
i got to tell you , it &apos;s such a great device though .
and i don &apos;t want to start whistling &quot; look for the union label , &quot; and all that happy worker crap .
safety -- safety first ?
if there &apos;s a plumber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant butt crack . admit it .
the infrastructure is a huge deal .
and i &apos;ve got malingering .
and we got to broadmoor .
and i said , &quot; where &apos;d you get that from ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what &apos;s the story ? &quot;
and hare said to me , &quot; you know what ? forget about some guy at broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness .
for instance , one famous story about him , somebody came up to him and said , &quot; i &apos;ve just bought myself a new car . &quot;
and then i realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had turned me a little bit psychopathic .
nothing bad happened .
after 9 / 11 , the tables were turned .
and ostensibly , the same is true of democracy .
i &apos;m here to tell you that many , many muslims believe -- the vast majority , in fact -- in fact i think i would go so far as to say that many muslims in saudi arabia believe that the core values of islam , namely acknowledgement of god &apos;s sovereignty and basic human equality before god , are themselves compatible with liberty , equality and free political choice .
that &apos;s not the way human circumstances operate .
so in these six years between these two oil spills , they built thousands of these well-ventilated boxes , and as a result , during the treasure rescue , just 160 penguins died during the transport process , as opposed to 5,000 .
it &apos;s a market town in the north of england , 15,000 people , between leeds and manchester , fairly normal market town .
so we went to the doctors , said , &quot; would you mind us taking them up ? &quot;
and then , we had a chat with the farmers , and we said , &quot; we &apos;re really serious about this , &quot; but they didn &apos;t actually believe us , so we thought , okay , what should we do ? i know . if we can create a campaign around one product and show them there is local loyalty to that product , maybe they &apos;ll change their mind and see we &apos;re serious .
encourage all our schools to take this seriously .
and to my astonishment , when i began seriously studying other traditions , i began to realize that belief -- which we make such a fuss about today -- is only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the west , in about the 17th century .
saint augustine made exactly the same point .
because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn &apos;t promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time .
we need to create a movement among all these people that i meet in my travels -- you probably meet , too -- who want to join up , in some way , and reclaim their faith , which they feel , as i say , has been hijacked .
that &apos;s their job . every cell has a mission in life , and these cells , the mission is to move blood around our body .
an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand .
now something &apos;s interesting here . this looks very different than any sand on earth that i &apos;ve ever seen , and i &apos;ve seen a lot of sand on earth , believe me .
and back in the &apos; 60s , they used to teach student radiographers to take x-rays , thankfully not on you and i , but on dead people .
but i quite love the way it &apos;s posed .
and i sent them back an x-ray .
the lorry goes in front of it . and it takes slices of x-rays through the lorry .
i do dream in x-ray . i see my projects in my sleep .
that &apos;s what i do .
that is a good thing .
though i should say that my son is best and is better than your children .
now for some people , that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism .
if i ever get out of here , there will always be a mark by my name .
socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
i was a south indian brought up in bengal .
and this is happening here .
thank you very much for your time .
so it &apos;s easy to think that corruption happens somewhere over there , carried out by a bunch of greedy despots and individuals up to no good in countries that we , personally , may know very little about and feel really unconnected to and unaffected by what might be going on .
he used one to buy the property , and another , which was in somebody else &apos;s name , to pay the huge bills it cost to run the place .
now many of these companies were in america or the united kingdom , its overseas territories and crown dependencies , and so it &apos;s not just an offshore problem , it &apos;s an on-shore one too .
now , it just shouldn &apos;t take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went .
in fact , i think that security is elusive . it &apos;s impossible .
there are evildoers and saints , criminals and victims .
they raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred .
i think what i &apos;m trying to say here is that if your end goal is security , and if that &apos;s all you &apos;re focusing on , what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people , but you make yourself far more insecure .
ee : i think that if you think about women , women are the primary resource of the planet . they give birth , we come from them , they are mothers , they are visionaries , they are the future . if you think that the u.n. now says that one out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in their lifetime , we &apos;re talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet , we &apos;re talking about the place where we come from , we &apos;re talking about parenting .
because that is what knopf is .
i had no idea what i was doing , i had no idea where i was going , but at some point , i stopped -- when to keep going would seem like i was going too far .
augusten burroughs wrote a memoir called &#91; &quot; dry &quot; &#93; , and it &apos;s about his time in rehab .
he will not be pleased .
not exactly jackie collins .
sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden because you know that if everything were free , then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos .
well , we heard that one too , but &quot; pioneer germ fighters &quot; totally rules .
adora svitak : what adults can learn from kids
and i want to show you some examples that typify the possibilities unlocked by diving into this universe .
yeah . well .
to play a game in those days you had to have an imagination to believe that you were really playing &quot; battlestar galactica . &quot;
so as far as popularity of games , what do you think these people are doing here ?
play enough video games and eventually you will really believe you can snowboard , fly a plane , drive a nine-second quarter mile , or kill a man .
dp : wow .
so what do artists do ? well , what artists do is to measure .
so the roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what &apos;s important about the data .
she saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two , so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there .
and i &apos;m dropping a little dot for each one of these things ; they &apos;re evenly spaced because they &apos;re 30 apart .
i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually probably a newton and the apple type story , but it &apos;s a great story .
i &apos;m focusing on biology , the biological sciences .
because when we talk about our genetics and our biology , and modifying and altering and adjusting these things , we &apos;re talking about changing ourselves .
and it &apos;s going to be used for diet as well , and nutritional supplements and such .
the idea that we &apos;re going to chose our children &apos;s genes , as we begin to understand what genes say about who we are .
it is being funded very very -- in a big way .
in the midst of all this amazing technology , and all these things that are occurring , it &apos;s really interesting because there is sort of a counter-revolution that is going on : a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past , in nutraceuticals , in all of these sorts of things that some people , in the pharmaceutical industry particularly , like to brand as non-science .
i think that our choice in the choice of life , is not whether we &apos;re going to go down this path .
i didn &apos;t know it would happen so quick , at eight .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
so we go online , and we put in &quot; cats mating . &quot;
the thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening .
this , like i say , is a cad model of me , and this is one of the later cad models .
my aorta is fixed , i haven &apos;t got to worry about it , which is a rebirth for me .
everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not assumed .
they &apos;ve really got to start talking to each other , and they &apos;ve got to exercise a bit of imagination , if that &apos;s not too much to ask -- which it probably is .
when you have a group of people who have had a different professional training , a different professional experience , they not only have a different knowledge base , but they have a different perspective on everything .
the first reason is certainly scientific .
they knew they had to focus on cheap , easy-to-use tools , and they focused on ddt .
so yeah , i &apos;m a newspaper cartoonist -- political cartoonist .
the third world is connected , we are connected .
and technology has even changed our relationship to god .
this is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning .
and cartoons can cross boundaries , as you have seen .
today , tech companies are the world &apos;s largest editors .
well , &quot; rare earth &quot; actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public .
but what about accidental death ?
this evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the permian , 250 million years ago , a comet hit us .
something else is , because if that doesn &apos;t survive , we are not here ; there are no mammals . it &apos;s that close ; one species ekes through .
but the new wave of paleontologists -- my graduate students -- collect biomarkers .
and i throw this slide in -- this is me , actually , two months ago -- and i throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal , chambered nautilus .
here &apos;s how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care .
one man died after working a 36-hour shift .
so a couple of years ago , we had a scandal which killed about 80 people around the world , because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain .
and eventually president clinton , in 1996 , convened a meeting at the white house , invited industry , human rights ngos , trade unions , the department of labor , got them all in a room and said , &quot; look , i don &apos;t want globalization to be a race to the bottom .
it &apos;s the old arms control phrase : &quot; trust , but verify . &quot;
but we break it down to some basic realities .
that there &apos;ll be days like this .
why was the scarecrow invited to ted ?
so i did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant , grown-up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me , &quot; hey , i really felt that too . &quot;
and then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours .
i &apos;m always trying to find the best way to tell each story .
it &apos;s clear that when i was a child , i definitely walked through life like this .
and that is the greatest present of all .
the press is certainly a business , and in order to survive it must be a successful business , but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility .
dead serbian soldiers were collected after a battle and used as barter for the return of prisoners or bosnian soldiers killed in action .
in 1994 , after three months of covering the south african election , i saw the inauguration of nelson mandela , and it was the most uplifting thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
when the story was published , unsolicited donations poured in .
i &apos;ve been working on a long project on crime and punishment in america .
military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history .
whenever there is an election , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to cheat , or something goes accidentally awry -- a ballot box goes missing here , chads are left hanging over here .
so you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote .
and there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this -- three billion in 1960 , seven billion just last year -- and it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies , and it may continue like this .
so bear with our simplicity now when i take you over to this shot .
it &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .
it &apos;s a tremendous improvement .
and that &apos;s where family planning , better child survival is needed .
the old , sadly , we will die .
someone saw me on television ; they called me up ; and they asked me if i &apos;d like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from san francisco to england . and i said , yes , i would do that , so i became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called &quot; medicine ball caravan . &quot;
day one , day two , day three , day four , day five , day six .
it wasn &apos;t just india that had smallpox deities ; smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world .
and david heymann , who &apos;s watching this on the webcast -- david , keep on going . we &apos;re close . we &apos;re down to four countries .
there &apos;ll be no airplanes flying .
and that simulation that i showed you that you thought was bird flu -- that was sars . and sars is the pandemic that did not occur .
and we &apos;ll add gapminder &apos;s amazing graphics to the front end .
so , yes , i want to take gphin ; i want to build on it ; i want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can ; i want to make this open to everybody so that the health officer in nairobi or in patna , bihar will have as much access to it as the folks in ottawa or in cdc ; and i want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people who are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity , and that it &apos;s accessible to everyone .
i &apos;ve spent my life as a warrior , working for women &apos;s issues , working on political campaigns , being an activist for the environment .
from there , we dove in .
my name is ryan lobo , and i &apos;ve been involved in the documentary filmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years .
this woman witnessed the general murdering her brother .
liberia is now home to an all-woman united nations contingent of indian peacekeepers .
but nonetheless , despite the hostility , firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire .
ryan lobo has traveled the world , taking photographs that tell stories of unusual human lives . in this haunting talk , he reframes controversial subjects with empathy , so that we see the pain of a liberian war criminal , the quiet strength of un women peacekeepers and the perseverance of delhi &apos;s underappreciated firefighters .
and then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on moi , who was the richest man -- still is the richest man -- in kenya .
oops , i &apos;m sorry . what was going on ?
if you look at declassified cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
light is good .
so under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
j well , i was a journalist .
well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in iceland , went to iceland and spoke about this issue .
these clipboards are filled with numbers .
what i love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art , versus science .
they weren &apos;t sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken , but they were sued because of california &apos;s proposition 65 , which stated that if there &apos;s anything dangerous in the products then the companies had to give a clear warning .
is it worth it to you ?
but here &apos;s the problem : sometimes patients become resistant to the drug , and then years after they &apos;ve been declared to be cancer free , they come back .
people spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors .
so any user can come in here and click on &quot; lung function report &quot; and it &apos;ll take them to this report that i created .
and , from my experience , you know , kids are naturally curious about what they don &apos;t know , or don &apos;t understand , or is foreign to them .
nobody calls her disabled .
and what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting-edge technology -- robotics , bionics -- with the age-old poetry , we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity .
i remember that in the year of 1990 , when i was graduating from college , i was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in beijing , great wall sheraton -- it &apos;s still there .
the controversy was so heated that the red cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
so it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old .
for the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
and the first picture showed us that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging .
you might think that it &apos;s quite hard to find new stories and new subjects , but new technology is changing the way we can film .
and we managed to get that magic moment .
and that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover .
we could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of read-write culture .
they had an exclusive license on the most popular content , and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate to the broadcasters who really was in charge .
i &apos;m not talking about nor justifying people taking other people &apos;s content in wholesale and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner .
we don &apos;t have a public domain to draw upon now , so instead what we need is two types of changes .
this is crystallized dna .
because we &apos;re just beginning to learn where we came from and what we are .
and the reason why they &apos;re ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries , and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core .
it takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time .
the reason why he &apos;s reprogramming that animal to have more wings is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child , and you picked up the lizard , sometimes the tail fell off , but it regrew .
because in all leukemia , that set of genes over there over-expresses .
in fact , it &apos;s not a genomically literate world .
here &apos;s differential productivity rates .
juan enriquez : the life code that will reshape the future
what i &apos;m going to do today is i &apos;m going to show you what the research says about why we &apos;re all liars , how you can become a liespotter and why you might want to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking , and ultimately to trust building .
and that can have dramatic costs for us .
men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people .
they manipulate via flattery .
now if he had repeated the question in its entirety , or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail -- and we &apos;re all really glad he didn &apos;t do that -- he would have further discredited himself .
and if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks , an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment .
but when anger turns to contempt , you &apos;ve been dismissed .
and if you look closely , you &apos;ll see duping delight throughout this video .
and that &apos;s the truth . thank you .
and talking about war , my girlfriend has this great t-shirt that says , &quot; bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity . &quot;
and language can &apos;t be understood in its abstraction .
so i was born in 1966 , at the beginning of the biafran-nigerian civil war , and the war ended after three years .
we are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent : the valuable resource of the imagination .
and i watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed .
my friend ronald gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t really -- i didn &apos;t see the point at the time .
this is me using &#91; unclear &#93; or 3-d studio , back in the &apos; 80s .
all right , there &apos;s that robot again .
i actually went to toys &quot; r &quot; us , got a little furry cat , ripped it apart and made this .
they had to fit within the envelope .
so in short , i &apos;m startled by all the things that they don &apos;t have .
let &apos;s contrast that for a minute to development .
in just five years , their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people .
well , they didn &apos;t stop there -- they localized it into 18 different languages .
no loo , no &quot; i do . &quot;
well on september 4th , there was a huge mop-up campaign , which is what you do in polio .
this is my baseline : this is the mediterranean coast with no fish , bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .
if we go back to a place like palmyra atoll , where i was with jeremy jackson a few years ago , the corals are doing better and there are sharks .
well , what we have seen is that in this particular area during el nino , year &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , the water was too warm for too long , and many corals bleached and many died .
the number of species increases 21 percent ; so if you have 1,000 species you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve .
but if we add the no-take reserve on top of that , the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected .
so how can we do that ?
enric sala : thank you .
the last one &apos;s a personal question .
this turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans .
in this case , we &apos;re passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this .
so that &apos;s all water under the sea -- a mile and a half , two miles , three miles down .
so , as soon as a crab touches them , they retract down into their shells , just like your fingernails .
so , the bacteria grows hair on the crab .
i think this is the neatest-looking thing .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
for example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
i &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
and here &apos;s how it works .
and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
the lesson of brian &apos;s presentation , in a way -- all those fantastic pictures -- is this really : that vantage point determines everything that you see .
what turned juanderson around was technology for learning that made learning fun and accessible .
this is the best you can get in hyderabad in indian education .
that &apos;s too long if you &apos;re poor .
and he was finally brought back into school , not by the offer of gcses , but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter , a practical making skill .
the chinese restaurant model spreads .
the most famous of these is reggio emilia in italy , the family-based learning system to support and encourage people in schools .
the finding love and respect , the part about trying to find your place in the world .
we have to wake up and find out the next day who &apos;s still on because we &apos;re too freaking tired to hear who stays on .
so , without further ado , i will present to you , ladies and gentlemen -- now be careful , &apos; cause it &apos;s evil -- a copy , the official copy , of the gay agenda .
but when you see the map , and you see our state of michigan -- it &apos;s legal to fire someone for being gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered , that it &apos;s legal to remove someone from their home because they &apos;re gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered , then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stripping someone &apos;s rights away , it &apos;s about granting them the rights that &#91; have &#93; already been stated .
how about this week ?
they had zero impact on energy consumption .
that &apos;s 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being but does contribute to climate change .
tell me . what should i do to save energy ? &quot;
some of the studies even say we &apos;re happier .
as i lost so much , i finally started to find myself . &quot;
what determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities , what kind of meaning we assign them , what kind of attitude we cling to about them , what state of mind we allow them to trigger . &quot;
but they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches .
now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators , then , just as in human sex , people might start to deceive .
they lay their eggs in it , thinking it &apos;s a nice bit of carrion , and not realizing that there &apos;s no food for the eggs , that the eggs are going to die , but the plant , meanwhile , has benefited , because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic .
and this is what it looks like with visible light .
i make my living from games . i &apos;ve been lucky enough to do this since i was 15 , which also qualifies as i &apos;ve never really had a real job .
nobody wants to go on the middle passage . &quot;
and you can zoom in . this is taking a look at atlanta .
so again , you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending sms messages from different parts of the city .
i think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid .
so we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces , and we fed those into the mechanical turk .
we wanted to see how this applies to collaborative , distributed music making , where nobody has any idea what it is they &apos;re working on .
so what we did was cross-cut a bunch of archival footage of johnny cash , and at eight frames a second , we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically changing music video .
and this is called &quot; the wilderness downtown . &quot;
so what if we were living in balloon houses ?
but i added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions .
not necessarily your mother , or indeed mine , but , as it were , the ideal mother , somebody who doesn &apos;t care about your achievements .
we can &apos;t relate to her . she speaks in a funny way .
in other words , your position in life comes to seem not accidental , but merited and deserved .
and he &apos;s going to do that on the day of judgment with angels and trumpets , and the skies will open .
my favorite is sophocles &apos; oedipus the king : &quot; sex with mum was blinding &quot; in a way , if you like , at one end of the spectrum of sympathy , you &apos;ve got the tabloid newspaper .
nonsense . you can &apos;t have it all . you can &apos;t .
so we should do everything we can , we should do everything we can to pursue it .
i hadn &apos;t swum for 31 years , not a stroke .
and i knew i could do it .
and this time , i don &apos;t like it , i didn &apos;t want to give into it , but there &apos;s a difference between a non-stop swim and a staged swim .
no , that &apos;s the last swim .
and then as we go further , today we have continuous glucose sensors .
i didn &apos;t want to take my shirt off to show you , but i can tell you it &apos;s on .
that looks like this .
you say , &quot; oh , ok . &quot; and a z.q. score is adjusted to age , and you want to get as high as you possibly can .
all these things are possible -- some of them are very close , or already , as you heard , are available today , in some way or form .
if we understand biology from genomics and omics and wireless through physiologic phenotyping , that &apos;s big .
but that &apos;s not the hard part . &quot;
that would solve the problem , but i don &apos;t see anybody doing any research on making people smaller .
you see , there &apos;s two forks in the road . we know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost , and nobody lives more than 120 years , for reasons that aren &apos;t very well understood .
and when you &apos;re hungry , food becomes more attractive , and so forth .
but in 1994 , three years later , i found myself losing interest in almost everything .
the first is that i knew that , objectively speaking , i had a nice life , and that if i could only get well , there was something at the other end that was worth living for .
and there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes .
there was a study i particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of non-depressed people were asked to play a video game for an hour , and at the end of the hour , they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed .
so i became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments .
and he had the cingulotomy , and it was incredibly successful .
i wish i could stop the pain . &quot;
isn &apos;t it part of your personality ? &quot;
and what i came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience , the ones who say , &quot; i was depressed a long time ago and i never want to think about it again and i &apos;m not going to look at it and i &apos;m just going to get on with my life , &quot; ironically , those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have .
and there is a way the world both envisions food , the way the world writes about food and learns about food .
steaming ought to be faster .
we would glue a piece of pyrex or heat-resistant glass in front .
we have a very high-speed camera , which we had lots of fun with on the book .
now we can fast forward many thousands of years into the bronze age and beyond .
and yet , operative mortality dropped profoundly .
and so -- i get to talk about robots -- the da vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that incision .
and then you need to add some more ports , and more .
as we take these capabilities , and we get to go to the next places , we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be .
now , i &apos;ve talked about the patient as if the patient is , somehow , someone abstract outside this room .
plastics cause serious problems , such as the destruction of ecosystems , the pollution of natural resources , and the reduction of available land space .
little did we know at that time that a trip to the dump and some research on the internet would take us on a life-changing journey of accidents and discoveries .
but if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates , they would have used some other kind of carbon source , and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway .
this is actually a training film for a clown college that they had .
this is an unusual installation of airport seating .
although i endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary , it &apos;s not me .
and here is some family pictures .
ed : no , bud . &quot; d &quot; &apos; s right . at buddy &apos;s -- audience : party . love .
they have trading cards and all sorts of cool things .
and i think that in these times when we fall back and regroup , that somehow or other , the banana leaf parable sort of got to get working there , because i &apos;m not prepared to say that the banana leaf that one eats off of is the same as the other eats off of .
i looked at slaves . i met slaveholders , and i looked very deeply into slave-based businesses because this is an economic crime .
add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world , caused by civil wars , ethnic conflicts , kleptocratic governments , disease ... you name it , you know it .
now , gentlemen ... brent , where is your money going this year ?
they are more expensive in places like north america .
well , first , before i even tell you the cost i &apos;ve got to be absolutely clear .
and america is still paying the price for the botched emancipation of 1865 .
it &apos;s a different idea , because usually , when people talk about early childhood programs , they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of former participants , in preschool , they have better k-12 test scores , better adult earnings .
and the trouble with that objection , it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent .
so as a result , if we can invest in other people &apos;s children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high-quality , we not only help those children , we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and we &apos;ll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth .
and if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something , what we &apos;re talking about is that , for the average low-income kid , that would increase earnings by about 10 percent over their whole career , just doing the preschool , not improving k-12 or anything else after that , not doing anything with college tuition or access , just directly improving preschool , and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle-class kids .
now , it &apos;s quite an old phenomenon ; it was discovered 100 years ago .
so , this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking .
it &apos;s a remarkable effect . it &apos;s very strong .
and the situation it describes is the hero of the book -- he &apos;s a 20th-century man -- finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people .
this is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the west , at least .
and that &apos;s because geologists of the future would kind of see a sharp shift in the strata of rock that is being laid down now .
if i take 30 steps linearly -- one , two , three , four , five -- i get to 30 .
some critics say , &quot; oh , well software is stuck in the mud . &quot;
then someone on the tracks screamed .
in general , everything was merely hearsay and rumor , and not a single person i spoke to for over 36 hours knew anything with any certainty .
the yale law professor yochai benkler , in an essay called &quot; coase &apos;s penguin , &quot; talks about this open-source model , which we &apos;re familiar with from linux , as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations .
it is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things -- that being linked from one place to another , that being tightly linked in a group , is a very good thing .
so , that &apos;s the upside . the circular mill is the downside .
we have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom ; you don &apos;t need the ones in the last two fingers .
if you were to descend into the 95 percent of the biosphere that &apos;s livable , it would quickly become pitch black , interrupted only by pinpoints of light from bioluminescent organisms .
now most of us , and i would say me included , think that human exploitation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last 50 to , perhaps , 100 years or so .
so a couple of years ago , i was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise and i couldn &apos;t go because of a scheduling conflict .
they went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in new york city and they barcoded it .
you can do this on a global scale , but you can also do it on a regional scale .
we found life in the extremes .
but you can imagine the biomass that represents .
and as the oceans go so shall we .
and what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs .
if there &apos;s one operation for a disease , you know it works .
i &apos;ve felt it in the operating room , at the bedside .
now , if we &apos;re talking about medicine , and we &apos;re talking about healing , i &apos;d like to quote someone who hasn &apos;t been quoted .
there can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down memories of childhood or perceiving the color of a rose if it doesn &apos;t affect the way you &apos;re going to move later in life .
but let me show you cutting-edge robotics .
so for example , if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand , you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback .
so i have sensory input , which i can take in to make beliefs .
and moreover , it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do .
well there &apos;s one very clear example where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person .
and one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys , they get into fights -- which started with one of them doing something to the other , the other retaliating .
so it re-shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts .
imagine i want to intercept this ball .
so i think people who study sensation or memory without realizing why you &apos;re laying down memories of childhood .
we sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of 1976 .
we believe there &apos;s some water in the polar caps , there are polar caps of north pole and south pole .
because on earth , almost all -- 99.9 percent -- of the methane is produced by living systems , not little green men , but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface .
we invited 10 of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two days .
the problem is we don &apos;t fly it to mars , we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to mars .
this is over tilamook , oregon .
she &apos;s like , &quot; oh , us . &quot; i &apos;m like , &quot; okay . all right . that &apos;s cool . &quot;
and at a certain point , you look around , you &apos;re like , &quot; whoa , this is a really nerdy crowd . &quot;
this is my house .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do now is to tell you about what we &apos;ve learned in those journeys .
i &apos;ve got another wal-mart story for you , ok ?
so , eight of us went to sacramento in august and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for ab32 .
but brazil &apos;s only 1.3 percent of the world &apos;s co2 emission .
do you know , they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in r &amp; amp ; d ?
moreover , if we succeed , it &apos;s going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since , as bill joy says , we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere .
and you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity , in which we &apos;re all embedded .
you could have friendship relationships , sibling relationships , spousal relationships , co-worker relationships , neighbor relationships and the like .
but shifted to the left is what &apos;s occurring in the central individuals .
now in our case , although it wasn &apos;t necessary , we could also actually map the network of the students .
without actually having to query them at all , we can get this kind of a structural insight .
after mapping humans &apos; intricate social networks , nicholas christakis and colleague james fowler began investigating how this information could better our lives . now , he reveals his hot-off-the-press findings : these networks can be used to detect epidemics earlier than ever , from the spread of innovative ideas to risky behaviors to viruses .
the inventive inhabitants , for instance , find opportunities in the most unexpected cases , like the adjacent parking garage , which has been reclaimed as a taxi route to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps in order to shorten the hike up to the apartments .
by nightfall , the area becomes almost pitch black , save for a small lightbulb or a fire .
the attention to this detail astonished me , and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment , from floor to ceiling , every part was decorated .
so i &apos;m scared we won &apos;t have enough robots .
and ordinary people can &apos;t interact with them .
and it &apos;s gone down slightly over the last 40 years .
they were gone in an instant .
we do have the technology that &apos;s scaleable , and our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate , so we &apos;re comfortable that this task can be accomplished .
ben kacyra : ancient wonders captured in 3d
there &apos;s a museum , of course , on the mall in washington , right next to lincoln and jefferson .
so what you now have when a congress is in session is members of congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds and saying , i &apos;m just told i have a d minus on genocide ; what do i do to get a c ? i just want to get a c. help me .
why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering ?
he was in the u.n. for 34 years . he joined at the age of 21 .
do you turn off the international spigot of life support and risk two million civilian lives ?
but it was too late for sergio .
what i take away , and this in some ways is the most important , he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really , really unusual .
and the lesson , i think , of the anti-genocide movement that i mentioned , that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do -- it &apos;ll be many decades , probably , before that happens -- but is that if we want to see change , we have to become the change .
others think about malthusian nightmares .
and we know that the issue is not just production of food .
even if they know what they need to do , it &apos;s not available .
or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week -- it costs about 50 cents -- will keep a girl in school , and they &apos;ll give birth to a healthier child , because the malnutrition is sent generation to generation .
we certainly saw that in 2008 .
and they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity .
josette sheeran : ending hunger now
i co-founded a company called navigenics , where , if you spit into a tube -- and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease , all of which are delayable in many of the cancers -- you start to identify what you could get , and then we can start to work to prevent them .
i &apos;m doing it so we can identify what we &apos;re up against .
and so , when you start to look at emergent systems , you can look at a neuron under a microscope .
but , if you start to look at it , that red , that dark color there , more than 75 percent of the population of those countries are obese .
they had to give it also in the u.s. to get approval , so i think there were three u.s. patients in upstate new york who were part of the trial .
and so , i implore everyone here : think differently . come up with new ideas .
birdsong , for example , is a sound which most people find reassuring .
the younger , maybe not .
julian treasure : the 4 ways sound affects us
young people would ask the most amazing questions .
fifty years ago , when i began exploring the ocean , no one -- not jacques perrin , not jacques cousteau or rachel carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it .
the poet auden said , &quot; thousands have lived without love ; none without water . &quot;
three years ago , i met john hanke , who &apos;s the head of google earth , and i told him how much i loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously .
also it &apos;s bad news for us .
but business as usual means that in 50 years , there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing , because the fish will simply be gone .
there are still places in the sea as pristine as i knew as a child .
star trek made me want to see alien creatures , creatures from a far-distant world .
one of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has is a structure called the halteres .
now , i want to get across that it &apos;s not just a matter of numbers but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons .
you can tether a fly to a little stick .
there are three important reasons .
now , we can speculate and philosophize this , but we don &apos;t actually have to for the next hundred years .
that &apos;s why you have to send your kids to good schools , hopefully eventually to oxford .
you realize that this poses a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain , and especially to a theory that says that there is some reality that emerges out of this carpet , out of this particular carpet with a particular pattern .
so , we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive .
so when we did this , we indeed , for the first time , saw these ghost-like structures : electrical objects appearing within the neocortical column .
the project began in &apos; 57 at general atomics there .
and this is still a very active subject .
finally , at the very end in 1964 , nasa steps in and says , &quot; ok , we &apos;ll support a feasibility study for a small version that could be launched with saturn vs in sections and pieced together . &quot;
you know , i don &apos;t know how many of those you read , but it &apos;s not fun to read and often not fun to write -- even worse to write .
which one seems longer ?
we have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision -- bigger than dedicated to anything else .
turns out the secret has to do with a form at the dmv .
it &apos;s the opposite . it &apos;s because we care .
i hope this worries you , by the way -- when you go to see your physician .
a print subscription for 125 .
which is why we have these four-minute dates .
but there is a silver lining .
and it &apos;s this limitation that doesn &apos;t cope with the demand of wireless data transmissions and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month .
and multiply that by 10,000 , then you end up at 14 billion .
in the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into these smart phones .
so for me , the applications of it , to me , are beyond imagination at the moment .
then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together ; we flatten the world .
well , now you ramp that up to four , and you have a lot of complexity , a lot of ways to describe mechanisms .
all those side effects , you know , oily residue and , you know , whatever they say in those commercials : forget about that .
and this is extremely profound .
well , you know , we really , we argue and debate about it -- we say it &apos;s climate , it &apos;s soil , it &apos;s this . well , guess what ?
if we could , would we ?
and they take this stuff seriously .
or they go , &quot; sit , sit , sit . &quot;
all i have to do is sit , and they do everything .
she never raised her voice .
&quot; johnny , don &apos;t do that . &quot; kick , kick , kick .
when i was a kid , i was a calculus whiz .
almost anything can happen within them .
ok ? and , as you can see , it is literally the diagram on the right .
there are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown seattle , but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain .
so i &apos;m going to show you what this actually means .
have to operate behind the i-64 corridor , a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites .
chris asked me to add -- the theater is under construction , and this project will start construction in about a year , and finish in 2010 .
wk : yeah .
wk : yeah .
and so , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever had this , but when i close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep , i can &apos;t stop thinking about my own eyes .
they want to ask me something .
in this painting that i made of the first 20 decimals of pi , i take the colors and the emotions and the textures and i pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape .
it can also mean the fibers that grow from a head .
how did we achieve that ?
and it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because i think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
and why does exchange raise living standards ?
go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself : &quot; who made them and for who ? &quot;
there &apos;s no working for each other across the colonies .
they were imaginative . they buried their dead .
and the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
and by the way , that &apos;s one of the reasons that i &apos;m not interested in the debate about i.q. , about whether some groups have higher i.q.s than other groups .
we use four million cups a day on airline flights , and virtually none of them are reused or recycled .
it &apos;s a strange thing to think about , that on 9 / 11 , when that tragedy happened , 3,000 americans died .
and strangely enough , the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction , and most of that is being done by men .
this is a picornavirus .
well , we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses on one chip , and we threw in herpes virus for good measure -- i mean , why not ?
you have no idea what walks in through the door .
you &apos;re looking at her open lung biopsy .
could be . and it might have nothing to do with cancer .
perhaps overlooked , volta &apos;s invention of the battery for the first time also demonstrated the utility of a professor .
it &apos;s fitted with solid electrodes and an electrolyte that &apos;s a solution of salt and water .
and the current passing between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature .
but the pace wasn &apos;t fast enough for us .
what &apos;s the key to using alternative energy , like solar and wind ? storage -- so we can have power on tap even when the sun &apos;s not out and the wind &apos;s not blowing . in this accessible , inspiring talk , donald sadoway takes to the blackboard to show us the future of large-scale batteries that store renewable energy . as he says : &quot; we need to think about the problem differently . we need to think big . we need to think cheap . &quot;
and i started putting those two together and wondering , could i build a toy where kids would kind of trip across all these interesting principles of life , as it exists and as it might go in the future .
and so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature .
so here &apos;s our little solar system , as we pull away from our melted planet here .
thank you .
so what nonverbals am i talking about ?
you get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades , and it seems to be partly attributable to participation .
so we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview .
so this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
and she said , she came in totally defeated , and she said , &quot; i &apos;m not supposed to be here . &quot;
probably none . i think we &apos;re all darwinians .
well , it &apos;s ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains .
well , many theories . but how could something tie them together ?
if they are , words are memes that can be pronounced .
and they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people , who had no immunity to them at all .
what you can do , however , is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence .
if you hold it too loosely , it flies away . &quot;
you can teach a bunch of south africans a tune in about five seconds flat .
will you have a go for me ?
normally when you improvise -- and i do it all the time around the world -- there &apos;s this initial period of horror , like everyone &apos;s too frightened to throw the hat into the ring , an awful pregnant silence .
and i wore it whenever i could , thinking it was the most fabulous thing i owned .
and the good news was that the institution , the banking institution , lasted .
one is in india , where there are 240 million farmers , most of whom make less than two dollars a day .
three : this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located .
only then did she talk about saving your children &apos;s lives .
and it &apos;s a big family reunion , and yet , like many family reunions , it &apos;s not all peace and light .
some years ago , i was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of russia and the leaders of chechnya .
what &apos;s the origin story of the middle east ?
it goes across 10 different countries in the middle east , because it unites them all . &quot;
the media love it ; they really adore it .
it simply depends on us .
one , i care that you spell it right .
it &apos;s time for liberals and conservatives to transcend their political differences and really listen to each other , says political pundit sally kohn . in this optimistic talk , kohn shares what she learned as a progressive lesbian talking head on fox news . it &apos;s not about political correctness , she says , but rather , emotional correctness .
so i wanted to figure out how i could get this kind of success into something small , like this , and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it , kids who didn &apos;t want to be outside could do it , and everyone could have access .
this immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an atm .
i thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy new york made sense , especially when the resources were free .
thank god omar knows that carrots come from the ground , and not aisle 9 at the supermarket or through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam .
the rest are scheduled to graduate this june .
let them cook . great lunch today , let them do culinary things .
about half of them , 600,000 , have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on .
what does the system look like ?
finally , if you &apos;re lucky , you are treated in three or four hours after the incident , but the heart muscle has died .
what is the result ? we designed a magnetic depolarizer that looks like this , that you could have -- a lady , in her pocket book -- and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works .
we use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that &apos;s used for the heart .
in other words , if you &apos;ve screwed up electrical signals , maybe , by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain , we can counteract that .
that &apos;s the present system . how about making a video ?
how do you decide what is important ?
why can &apos;t we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives ?
i &apos;m here to talk about books .
her material is now used over 600,000 times per month .
this costs , anybody guess ?
it gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience to each individual student , so that every student can have a book or a course that &apos;s customized to their learning style , their context , their language and the things that excite them .
and the ideas , the creative commons licenses .
connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge .
so with those as the principles -- some of you may know seymour papert ; this is back in 1982 , when we were working in senegal .
and it &apos;s not important because you can buy components at a lower price , ok ?
now the display on your laptop costs , in rough numbers , 10 dollars a diagonal inch .
that &apos;s why a lot of our people are more or less living in taiwan right now .
it &apos;s kind of agonizing , because a lot of people say , &quot; well , let &apos;s do it at the state level , &quot; because , of course , states are more nimble than the feds , just because of size .
so we want to make it very much like a white volvo .
you &apos;re not robocop , and you &apos;re not terminator , but you &apos;re cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen or use one of your cell phone devices .
and so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open , which is basically your facebook wall , so that people don &apos;t write on it in the middle of the night -- because it &apos;s very much the equivalent .
they would click on a button , and they would be connected as a to b immediately .
it actually looks very organic .
there are 1.4 million pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries living with hiv and of these , 90 percent are in sub-saharan africa .
so again , i look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of hiv in africa .
and then they give you another test and they tell you you &apos;re hiv-positive , and you &apos;re devastated .
so the mothers who work for us , they come from the communities in which they work .
we also work in groups .
i am proof that there is hope .
our health care systems are broken .
fifteen years ago , it was widely assumed that the vast majority of brain development takes place in the first few years of life .
this region is more active in adolescents when they make these social decisions and think about other people than it is in adults , and this is actually a meta-analysis of nine different studies in this area from labs around the world , and they all show the same thing , that activity in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases during the period of adolescence .
so there &apos;s a famous quote by shakespeare from &quot; the winter &apos;s tale &quot; where he describes adolescence as follows : &quot; i would there were no age between ten and three-and-twenty , or that youth would sleep out the rest ; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child , wronging the ancientry , stealing , fighting . &quot;
so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand , and a few years later , he was diagnosed with cancer .
we invited leading artists , engineers , and philosophers to write essays about this , and the results , the results are collected in this book from mit press .
it &apos;s being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world , and the idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame , but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious , like suturing , and currently , all of these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon , so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time .
they can &apos;t solve all of the world &apos;s problems , but i think they have something important to teach us .
now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter , but that &apos;s not going to change the setting on the thermostat , which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up .
several long-term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later , even if they started at a normal weight , and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders .
give yourself permission to eat as much as you want , and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel good .
nelson mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom .
if mandela was the national and international embodiment , then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man , solly mhlongo .
wham ! it hits me by my right leg .
in fact , solly gave her the name elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the elvis the pelvis dance .
he was suffering .
so when netra and i sat down to make our first plan 10 years ago , we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves .
and i &apos;ve been very supportive until this picture shows up on my facebook page .
you know , if this is so , it occurred to me that maybe , just maybe , the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity .
and most folks don &apos;t even know they exist .
i want you to know that me , my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips .
because this is the most distressing ted ever , i &apos;ve been working with neil gershenfeld on next year &apos;s ted bag .
and it &apos;s by a guy named pastor rick warren , and it &apos;s called &quot; the porpoise driven life . &quot;
now , we &apos;ve actually done some research -- neil gershenfeld and the fab labs went out into the market .
so i want to show you some prototypes .
buy &quot; the purpose-driven life , &quot; or satan will take your soul .
then we &apos;re going to make an escalator that helps you get up there .
and i fear , if we do nothing for our planet , in 20 years , it &apos;s going to look like this .
you may have seen this in other forms , but the top line is the amount of protected area on land , globally , and it &apos;s about 12 percent .
seamounts are important for biodiversity .
and what &apos;s the context of the phoenix islands ?
so i started contacting them -- because they had actually given me a permit to do this -- and i said , &quot; i want to come up and tell you what we found . &quot;
the oak foundation and national geographic have been big funders of this as well .
he paused and put his hands together and said , &quot; yes , greg , but the devil will be in the details , &quot; he said .
as it turns out , when tens of millions of people are unemployed or underemployed , there &apos;s a fair amount of interest in what technology might be doing to the labor force .
now , siri is far from perfect , and we can make fun of her flaws , but we should also keep in mind that if technologies like siri and watson improve along a moore &apos;s law trajectory , which they will , in six years , they &apos;re not going to be two times better or four times better , they &apos;ll be 16 times better than they are right now .
but some other people do , and they &apos;ve kind of crashed the party and loosened up the dress code of innovation .
and i flew back to austria , packed my bags , and , another week later , i was again on my way to hong kong still superstitions and thinking , &quot; well , if that &apos; winner &apos; billboard is still up , i &apos;m going to have a good time working here .
now , what i took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness .
or , as nancy said before , like really immerse oneself into it .
nevertheless , the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies , from much worse to much better than in our modern societies .
for example , there &apos;s particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in east asia , associated with confucius &apos; doctrine of filial piety , which means obedience , respect and support for elderly parents .
widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge .
older people have that experience .
thank you .
so the librarians find out and they get together a special solution , a chemical solution called king &apos;s water , that when mixed with 99 stones would be able to save all that culture and history in the books .
now the main bad guy , rughal , does not want these stones to update , so he &apos;s trying to get them to stop updating .
now i went to dubai , to an arab thought foundation conference , and i was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist .
rughal : there must be something we can do .
the second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn &apos;t related to her .
in &quot; the 99 , &quot; naif al-mutawa &apos;s new generation of comic book heroes fight more than crime -- they smash stereotypes and battle extremism . named after the 99 attributes of allah , his characters reinforce positive messages of islam and cross cultures to create a new moral framework for confronting evil , even teaming up with the justice league of america .
and the recent financial crisis , how much of this diagram might that figure take up ?
if we look closer , we see those peaks occur at the same month every year .
yeah , retail therapy might help .
so here we go . this is your senses , pouring into your senses every second .
so its military budget is bound to be enormous .
this kind of diagram is called a balloon race .
but it can go beyond data , and it can go beyond numbers .
it &apos;s a fragrance called beyond paradise , which you can find in any store in the nation .
this smells of cut grass . now , this is the skeleton of the molecule .
a theory is something that enables you to do less work .
the bad news is they &apos;re rocket fuels .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
and the prediction is it should smell of coumarin .
so , very quickly , when president obama said , &quot; i don &apos;t see why we can &apos;t have a one-page , plain english consumer credit agreement . &quot;
and the irs has introduced the program .
so the adoption papers were signed .
&quot; because you don &apos;t love us , norman , clearly you &apos;ve chosen your path . &quot;
in creativity i saw light .
banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3 .
you look at them in september , they &apos;ve gone down .
right ? this idea , zero to three .
and you &apos;ve never read a study from mit that says giving your kid dance instruction is going to help them do algebra better , but you will give that kid dance instruction , and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction , and it will make your day . and why shouldn &apos;t poor kids have the same opportunity ? it &apos;s the floor for these children .
this year , somewhere between 44 and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level .
so that we have to do . but this innovation issue , this idea that we &apos;ve got to keep innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical .
what are you talking about that you want to leave school ?
who was the better man ?
never retreat to the &apos; glorious past . &apos; keep to the track , to the beaten track ; treat every day of your life as your last .
lady lady , do not weep -- what is gone is gone . now sleep .
and what of the constitution , that bully of last resort ?
that was in october of 2000 .
shoulder to shoulder , night after night , we hoarded and sold her -- our lady in white .
and it &apos;s important to remember that , because the bonobos are so human , and they share 99 percent of their genes with us .
and the rift valley is a depression .
his brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey , probably sweating heavily as they did so .
we &apos;re certainly a polluting , wasteful , aggressive species , with a few nice things thrown in , perhaps .
louise leakey : a dig for humanity &apos;s origins
i grabbed all the reference , and i found this lovely piece of reference .
it is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1700 for a swedish count , and it is very likely the object from which hammett drew his inspiration for the maltese falcon .
so i was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure .
like it is in the movie .
and then everything went black .
i was at a crossroads .
and the question i asked myself is , if i couldn &apos;t do that , then who was i ?
she said , &quot; you are , because , see , it happens to everyone .
it was everybody &apos;s pain . and then i knew , just like before , that i had a choice . i could keep fighting this or i could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life .
they sat me down . there are buttons and dials everywhere .
but that didn &apos;t matter , because now there was something inside that burned that far outweighed my injuries .
but today what i &apos;d like to talk to you about is that love of form and how form can touch people &apos;s soul and emotion .
it fits arthritic hands . it fits children &apos;s hands .
it cost 1.7 million dollars to develop . it &apos;s called &quot; go &quot; by bernhardt , usa .
those holes you see there are very filtered-down , watered-down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures .
you do and not anaesthetized , separated from life .
like i say , it &apos;s a cross between natural history museum and a nasa laboratory . it &apos;s full of prototypes and objects .
and the reason i turned out the lights is because i knew i would see this phenomenon of animals making light called bioluminescence .
this is some shot , by dr. mike latz at scripps institution , of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton .
it &apos;s got light organs in the mouth , it &apos;s got light organs in every single scale , in the fins , in a mucus layer on the back and the belly , all used for different things -- some of which we know about , some of which we don &apos;t .
so i &apos;m holding it , and i &apos;m about to touch that tube on its shoulder , and when i do , you &apos;ll see bioluminescence coming out .
and i didn &apos;t know what i was going to discover , so i couldn &apos;t get the funding for this .
thank you .
one was sick and the other one was healthy , so he had to make sure they ate the proper food .
diy drones is the community ; they do this thing called arducopter .
or again , another project where , by analyzing the twitter feed of a family , you can basically point where they are , like in the &quot; harry potter &quot; movie .
but when you have this idea , you know , what happens to all these ideas ?
two-and-a-half years ago , i fainted from exhaustion .
it &apos;s my job to make sure the collection stays okay , and that it grows , and basically it means i collect dead animals .
and here are the ducks again .
more importantly , people started to send me their observations of remarkable animal behavior , and believe me , if there &apos;s an animal misbehaving on this planet , i know about it .
that &apos;s on june 5 every year .
and after some time , this perception became a feeling .
yeah , nicole kidman sounds good .
for example , perceiving infrared is good because you can actually detect if there &apos;s movement detectors in a room .
and our guide was a local science teacher .
but the reality is , these crazy cases are relatively rare . they don &apos;t usually win .
well that &apos;s been studied too , by the institute of medicine and others . turns out that &apos;s not the case .
i grew up in the south and whiled away the summers fishing .
we &apos;ve forgotten that second part .
but it &apos;s a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the 1960s to all these really bad values : racism , gender discrimination , pollution -- they were bad values . and we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore .
and even as we do our own work , all too often , we find ourselves having to choose and doing the expected thing , or the required thing , or the profitable thing .
so it &apos;s just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to protect ourselves against that .
together they comprise practical wisdom , which aristotle thought was the master virtue .
judge forer had to follow the law .
if instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures , they will do fewer .
they wanted to do something about what we all know , namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system .
and ken and i believe that this is what practitioners actually want .
it &apos;s something we have to , too , and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses have to start , in effect , putting on their google-tinted glasses , or whatever .
but when it comes to knocking the brand , if the terrorists are coca-cola and we &apos;re pepsi , i don &apos;t think , being pepsi , anything we say about coca-cola , anyone &apos;s going to believe us .
today &apos;s approach , governments have learned from their mistakes .
in omagh , bomb went off , real ira , middle of a peace process .
but it &apos;s not an easy road . after the bomb , the victims are not into this .
thank you .
it was characterized by a nation-versus-nation , very fragile standoff .
what percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter ?
although the scenario has changed very considerably , the fact is that we haven &apos;t changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means .
there &apos;s an unbelievable amount of know-how out there .
and lebed came to the united states and told us that many , many -- more than 80 of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable .
you assume that .
part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves , personally , are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe .
and jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything , whether it &apos;s war or terrorism , is abolition of nuclear weapons .
there &apos;s a lot of bad actors out there that have done the wrong thing , that actually have made the problem worse .
all wealth is actually created by business .
it &apos;s too expensive to have a safe working environment , therefore business makes more money if they don &apos;t have a safe working environment .
there &apos;s a fundamental opportunity for business today to impact and address these social problems , and this opportunity is the largest business opportunity we see in business .
so we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught , they do not have a cadaver dissection lab .
ok .
you can also interact with your x-ray , and also if you want , you can compare with how anatomy would appear in x-ray , too .
and then i thought about it a little bit , and i said , &quot; well , is it really that easy ?
in fact , they have hackers writing them .
and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .
because it really only has to do with these concepts of information , of storing information within physical substrates -- anything : bits , nucleic acids , anything that &apos;s an alphabet -- and make sure that there &apos;s some process so that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect the time scales for the deterioration of information .
and part of the reason why we don &apos;t know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems is what you see here .
and the fact is , millions is a gross estimate because we don &apos;t really know how many kids die each year of this .
and it actually worked great .
they &apos;re getting software capacity out there but they &apos;re not actually flying around the world .
what happened after we did this ?
by understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction .
because we will throw away these political dogmas .
in the middle of the pacific , when you don &apos;t have the good winds , you cannot land , you cannot go back .
if you tell to people , we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world , people will laugh at you , except here , where crazy people are invited to speak .
you cannot imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it &apos;s not only a dream and a vision , it &apos;s a real airplane .
and he should have said , &quot; what a strange , long trip it &apos;s about to become . &quot;
it was a great moment , and it utterly changed my life .
the right to live like a human .
and deep down , if we really accepted that africans were equal to us , we would all do more to put the fire out .
and that might be smart in these nervous , dangerous times .
a whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this .
and i &apos;m not really one for the warm , fuzzy feeling .
but my disappointment has much more perspective when i talk to american people , and i hear their worries about the deficit , and the fiscal well being of their country .
the war against terror , yes .
anyway , so i &apos;d like your help in getting that signed up .
americans have an unprecedented opportunity .
it &apos;s a very , very good idea to get them wired .
we mix and match what we know about the metaphor &apos;s source , in this case the sun , with what we know about its target , juliet .
metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia , in which we understand one concept in the context of another .
but this is how metaphor misleads .
and the proper translation of &quot; cogito ergo sum &quot; is &quot; i shake things up , therefore i am . &quot;
the solidarity of millions of yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing .
pm : i don &apos;t think so .
you can be yourself and have your face .
and you cannot do parachute reporting -- just jump into a country for two days and think that you &apos;ve done your homework and a story .
but i was not limited when i sang , and as air came up from my lungs , through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound , it was the closest thing i had ever come to transcendence .
the pump was a little bit problematic when performing , so i &apos;d attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ace bandage .
thankfully , in a few minutes , i saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs , which is a side effect of the medication , and i knew i &apos;d be okay .
i fell into this apocalyptic dream world .
when we do , we will find that patients don &apos;t just survive ; we thrive .
and in europe , there &apos;s certain parts of europe , where we &apos;re seeing a four-fold increase in certain genital birth defects .
but just two weeks before that , the u.s. senate refused to even debate the banning of bpa in babies &apos; bottles and sippy cups .
oh what ?
they &apos;re exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin , which was originally used as a nerve gas .
and here is the flotsam near california state university long beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday .
now , how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton ?
i wasn &apos;t happy . i was angry . i couldn &apos;t see my cartoons .
and nowhere was this brought home more than during hurricane sandy . so what you had in hurricane sandy was a superstorm , the likes of which we hadn &apos;t seen for a long time , hitting the iphone capital of the universe -- -- and you got volumes of media like we &apos;d never seen before .
sometimes you come across a piece of content that is so compelling , you want to use it , you &apos;re dying to use it , but you &apos;re not 100 percent sure if you can because you don &apos;t know if the source is credible .
so that was the only one that gave us a clue .
given a couple of clues , i could probably find out a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out .
redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through , and even today , individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before , including , in the summer of 2006 , hyperion , the world &apos;s tallest tree .
his friend , a guy named marwood harris , was following behind .
there is a small person right down there on the ground .
there &apos;s the person , right there . the person is waving to us .
but as you go and you look closer at a tree , what you see is , you see increasing complexity .
richard preston : yes , that is correct . i mentioned hyperion , the world &apos;s tallest tree .
when i was six years old , i was walking back from school on a friday afternoon with my older brother .
we &apos;ll buy these beepers , just tell your dispatch to send us the beeper , and we will run and save lives . &quot;
the reasons why we &apos;re so successful are because of three things .
something special happened .
we all want to be heroes .
so here standing up is basit .
every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .
and i know , it doesn &apos;t really look much different from the original .
so if you look at what stuxnet did is that it infected these .
it &apos;s been 25 years since the first pc virus hit the net , and what was once an annoyance has become a sophisticated tool for crime and espionage . computer security expert mikko hyppönen tells us how we can stop these new viruses from threatening the internet as we know it .
terrorists , they &apos;re rational .
five factorial is 120 .
they &apos;re careerists , they also care about getting credit -- there &apos;s ego involvement , they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome , or as important , if it &apos;s their druthers , to block an outcome .
and then the model makes predictions down the road .
here is mr. ahmadinejad .
bruce bueno de mesquita : a prediction for the future of iran
now , what do we do when we find a match ?
it &apos;s not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners .
there &apos;s a new moon on the horizon .
he saw that first glint of light -- he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now .
it &apos;s been said that when an elder dies , it &apos;s as if a library is burned . anthropologist elizabeth lindsey , a national geographic fellow , collects the deep cultural knowledge passed down as stories and lore .
what makes the difference in their performance ? &quot;
and everybody in this room -- you wouldn &apos;t be in this room if you bought that theory -- but the -- most of society thinks biography is destiny .
so , emotion is it . and if we get the right emotion , we can get ourselves to do anything . we can get through it .
but what was his decision of what to focus on ?
second , once you know what the target that &apos;s driving you is and you uncover it for the truth -- you don &apos;t form it ; you uncover it -- then you find out what &apos;s your map , what &apos;s the belief systems that are telling you how to get those needs .
like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there . total variety and uncertainty .
i said , &quot; focus on : &apos; there &apos;s food &apos; &quot; -- what a concept , you know .
or , no matter what happens , they find a way to be happy or excited .
it &apos;s the only way our world &apos;s going to change . god bless you .
there &apos;s language gaps , there &apos;s ethnicity and racial gaps , there &apos;s age gaps , there &apos;s gender gaps , there &apos;s sexuality gaps , there &apos;s wealth and money gaps , there &apos;s education gaps , there &apos;s also religious gaps .
so it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions .
in weather , the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent , so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they &apos;re part of the sun .
&quot; i love how i feel today . &quot;
you know , orion facing the roaring bull .
so we can see where it &apos;s emerging here , like president ford , iraq , bush . and we can actually isolate just the words -- i call them secrets -- and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list . and we see anna nicole smith playing a big role recently .
so we see that he was a bit quiet on saturday , but he was back to work on sunday morning , and actually been tapering off since then this week .
but i think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
far from it . they are , in fact , the most diverse , evocative , poetic aspect of nature .
these clouds spread out at the top in this enormous anvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere .
it takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine .
and this is a challenge .
and one of the applications that we &apos;ve been working on -- and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide -- is the application of virtual autopsies .
it really just works like a huge iphone .
and you just saw motts the research engineer , there , going into the mri system , and he was wearing goggles .
anders ynnerman : visualizing the medical data explosion
the office was working with a school , and they had an old victorian school building .
and the problem is that , up until now , it was the monetary economy which had all the infrastructure and all the tools .
of course , the house is never finished .
if we &apos;re talking about the 21st-century city , these are the guys who are going to be making it .
and he wasn &apos;t doing that . he was scribbling with chalk on the pavement .
the alternative is that the big bang wasn &apos;t the beginning .
that &apos;s progress : when we prove things wrong .
my parents were both elected to the first parliament , alongside nelson and winnie mandela . they were the only other couple .
and that &apos;s really exciting .
you know , from physics to medicine , in particular , epidemiology and also mathematical modeling .
well , it &apos;s not my ted wish ; it &apos;s our wish , as you &apos;ve already gathered .
so , just in ending , let me say the only people who can fix africa are talented young africans .
it would really boost the economy .
if you just look at these two pictures , these kind of words pop into your mind .
now , this is starting to happen in transistors .
it makes the brain inherently robust .
when you stand still , you just see the light and dark contrasts .
i &apos;m interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive , what we like to call &quot; supermassive &quot; black hole at the center of our galaxy .
and inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the sun .
it &apos;s the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit .
and that &apos;s the fun .
andrea ghez : the hunt for a supermassive black hole
it &apos;s all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches .
well notation not only passed the music on , notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely , because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale .
so you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions .
and technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes , using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences .
if you &apos;re curious , if you have a capacity for wonder , if you &apos;re alive , you know all that you need to know .
wind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar : 3600 terawatts , more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over .
saul griffith : high-altitude wind energy from kites !
and another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind , because i don &apos;t -- i &apos;m one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted , so if i &apos;m trying to do homework , if i &apos;m trying to do homework and i don &apos;t feel like it , i &apos;ll try to draw or , you know , waste my time .
i mean , it &apos;s quite brutal .
well , i think it &apos;s the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call &quot; crowd-accelerated innovation . &quot;
that &apos;s a lot of light .
we spark off each other .
he told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this .
now , this is big .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s actually happening right now .
and also , could you create the worst possible tedtalk that they would still let you get away with ?
the most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker .
so i &apos;m going to take as inspiration the fact that we &apos;re all interested in interacting with other people , i &apos;m going to completely strip it of all its complicating features , and i &apos;m going to turn that object , that simplified object , into a scientific probe , and provide the early stages , embryonic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact .
drugs of abuse would come in , and they would change the way you value the world . they change the way you value the symbols associated with your drug of choice , and they make you value that over everything else .
it engages deep systems in our brain , in dopaminergic systems that are there to make you chase sex , food and salt .
when methane built up , or carbon dioxide built up , or oxygen was diminished , the birds would swoon before people would -- so it acted as an early warning system : hey , get out of the mine . things aren &apos;t going so well .
the other thing to think of is what an honor it is , as a politician , to give a ted talk , particularly here in the u.k. , where the reputation of politics , with the expenses scandal , has sunk so low .
well , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to suffer a short , condensed history lesson about what i would say are the three passages of history : the pre-bureaucratic age , the bureaucratic age and what we now live in , which i think is a post-bureaucratic age .
if we take transparency , here is one of my favorite websites , the missouri accountability portal .
why ? it cuts fuel poverty , it cuts their bills , and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time .
reading and writing dna code is getting easier and cheaper .
we like to build things .
now , you might be asking yourself , &quot; well , you know , what would i do in a biolab ? &quot;
if you had spaces like this all over the world , it could really change the perception of who &apos;s allowed to do biotech .
people are less likely to come forth to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition , none of which helps these individuals or the communities these laws purport to protect .
you &apos;re a class b felon , lifetime sex offender .
in some parts of the world -- like here in the middle east and north africa -- new infections are rising and so are deaths .
but changing the law isn &apos;t .
in fact , if you fly over germany , for example , and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages , they &apos;re all about a mile apart .
now there &apos;s some trends that will impact cities .
it &apos;s something of an internet typology pattern , so you can have a series of these neighborhoods .
one of our graduate students then says , well , how does a driverless car communicate with pedestrians ?
so the developers say , well this is great . okay , so if we have a conventional building , we have a fixed envelope , maybe we can put in 14 units .
we think ultimately all of this stuff can come together , a new model for mobility , a new model for housing , a new model for how we live and work , a path to market for advanced technologies , but in the end the main thing we need to focus on are people . cities are all about people .
and sharks used to come into the bay .
and it &apos;s been suggested that basking sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change , because they &apos;re basically continuous plankton recorders swimming around with their mouth open .
colleagues from the isle of man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the isle of man all the way out to nova scotia in about 90 days .
that &apos;s it .
so when i saw the black slime on the bow of the boat , i thought , &quot; if you take what you &apos;re given in this world ... &quot;
so as i said , these things are sent to you in strange ways . grab them while you can .
so i built a prosthetic baby , and i went into the village , pretended as though this baby had been born with a deformity , and here was the guys who do the killing .
second official : i don &apos;t even know the place called &#91; unclear &#93; .
toilet facilities : very bad .
aa yes , yes .
we start forming cliques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what acceptance feels like .
when i was 15 , and i called my father to tell him that i had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
visibility really is key .
after traveling so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and democrats and republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the lgbt community as there are within the human race .
and more importantly , that line between good and evil -- which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable , with them on the good side , and the others on the bad side -- i knew that line was movable , and it was permeable .
but how am i going to -- how am i going to deal with that hypothesis ?
he comes down and says , &quot; i want to know , who is responsible ?
there &apos;s a study some of you think you know about , but very few people have ever read the story . you watched the movie .
and as you go along , the guy is screaming , &quot; i &apos;ve got a heart condition ! i &apos;m out of here ! &quot;
milgram &apos;s study is all about individual authority to control people .
they strip them naked . they sexually taunt them .
uncritical conformity to group norms .
aleksandr solzhenitsyn says , &quot; the line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being . &quot;
and i ended the study the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what anyone could do , &quot; no big deal to jump on the tracks .
so all of those colored lines correspond to bunches of axons , the fibers that join cell bodies to synapses .
so just think of this : you have a grid of neurons , and now you have a plane mechanical change in the position of the grid , and you get a warping of your mental experience .
what happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self , you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence , and , in fact , there can be images going on , being formed in the cerebral cortex , except you don &apos;t know they &apos;re there .
the first two are shared with many , many other species , and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species .
thank you . thank you for hip-hop -- and anita hill .
i say , &quot; intersectionality . &quot;
it &apos;s enough to make you feel very overwhelmed .
it &apos;s to say we operate on two levels .
my goal , quite simply , is to help people become more in tune with themselves .
and i &apos;m here today to share a new way that we &apos;re working with technology to this end to get familiar with our inner self like never before -- humanizing technology and furthering that age-old quest of ours to more fully know the self .
we created technology and applications that engaged people &apos;s imaginations , and it was really exciting .
the more you focus , the faster the rotation .
on the subject of google , today you can search and tag images based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them .
do you know what i wanted to be ?
hey .
so i rammed through life as only a casey can do .
can i tell you , airports are a disaster .
he thought i was mad enough anyway .
look where my belief had brought me to .
from global management consultant to elephant handler .
and you know , the oddest part is , when i was on my way traveling here to ted , i &apos;ll be honest , i was petrified .
in two weeks time , that &apos;s the ninth anniversary of the day i first stepped out onto that hallowed &quot; jeopardy &quot; set .
i remember being able to play trivial pursuit against my parents back in the &apos; 80s and holding my own , back when that was a fad .
but as the years went on , as ibm started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this , i started to get occasional updates from them , and i started to get a little more worried .
i think guys had &quot; w-a-t-s-o-n &quot; written on their bellies in grease paint .
and suddenly there was a machine that did that , and now we don &apos;t need to remember that anymore .
according to a national geographic survey i just saw , somewhere along the lines of 80 percent of the people who vote in a u.s. presidential election about issues like foreign policy cannot find iraq or afghanistan on a map .
and it &apos;s not effective if you say , &quot; well , hold on .
we should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us .
but actually the power to re-brand things -- to understand that actually our experiences , costs , things don &apos;t actually much depend on what they really are , but on how we view them -- i genuinely think can &apos;t be overstated .
six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time between paris and london by about 40 minutes .
everybody else at the time of google , more or less , was trying to be a portal .
actually my pain experienced in paying five pounds is not just proportionate to the amount , but where i think that money is going .
what you need to do is first of all tell people that 98 percent of mail gets there the next day , first-class mail .
the public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in america because we don &apos;t have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures .
the beer goes in and out , the waitresses go in and out , and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in .
and they &apos;re sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings , and the renderings , and all the chinese food caskets are lying on the table , and -- i mean , what was the conversation that was going on there ?
not just flower beds , not just cartoons of the sierra nevada mountains .
this is really , in fact , a television broadcasting a show 24 / 7 called &quot; we &apos;re normal . &quot;
we &apos;re going have to grow more food closer to where we live .
one final thing -- i &apos;ve been very disturbed about this for years , but i think it &apos;s particularly important for this audience .
&quot; i found these stamps as a child , and i have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to .
it &apos;s in my pocket right now . &quot;
and people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they &apos;ve lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for .
frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
from these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before .
people will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the occasions when it works they will publish , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t .
but it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very , very well studied .
complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia and death .
the digital universe atlas has been built at the american museum of natural history over the past 12 years .
and the cambodians have actually controlled the hayden planetarium from their high school .
if you haven &apos;t seen it , it &apos;s worth reading . he &apos;s a pianist himself , and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples &apos; lives in unusual situations .
every single book is robotic , so they all move , they all make sound , and when you put them all together , they turn into these walls , which have the gesture and the personality of simon powers . so he &apos;s disappeared , but the whole physical environment becomes this person .
in fact , this is the score for dan &apos;s piece , completely composed by dan in hyperscore .
and the first mate takes a rope and ties odysseus to the mast in a nice knot .
i mean , let &apos;s face it , the present self is present .
on average , it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that i would regret .
and we &apos;re at a situation now where for every three baby boomers , the mckinsey global institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they &apos;re in retirement .
by using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome , people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well-being in the future .
and just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider .
now i know we learned that in math class , but now it &apos;s everywhere in the culture -- the x prize , the x-files , project x , tedx .
and once that happened , once this material was in latin , it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years .
in the sorts of countries i work in , that so-called treatment gap approaches an astonishing 90 percent .
what sundar stands for , in hindi , is &quot; attractive . &quot;
and their basic inspiration was a stern review of lord stern .
at the species level , it &apos;s been estimated that insect-based pollination , bees pollinating fruit and so on , is something like 190 billion dollars-worth .
we tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth , it &apos;s common goods .
and the world bank has acknowledged this and they &apos;ve started a project called waves -- wealth accounting and valuation of ecosystem services .
more of that in a minute .
well , not as big as his , but fairly big .
what feynman hated worse than anything else was intellectual pretense -- phoniness , false sophistication , jargon .
sometimes i would win , mostly he would win , but we both enjoyed them .
in the 1950s , people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked .
the electron hits it suddenly .
in this low-key , image-packed talk from 2002 , designer christopher c. deam talks about his makeover of an american classic : the airstream travel trailer .
these are inuit children cutting whale blubber .
this is -- this is a great stage for a kid .
and so that &apos;s not going to be a solution that &apos;s going to get us global with biologic tissue .
it &apos;s not hardware .
they got you out of purgatory faster .
ted is all about patterns in the clouds .
jay walker : my library of human imagination
there &apos;s a mix an inventor has to have .
the air is not linear , as we &apos;ve always been taught .
we put it on a turret with a camera , so that when they shoot at you , you &apos;re over there , and it &apos;s there .
now to move and to balance , rezero needs to turn the ball .
but there &apos;s also a certain beauty within this technology .
and these tiling units , i designed specifically so that they would contain parts of letterforms within their shapes so that i could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the abstract patterning .
these are my valentines from 2005 and 2006 .
so i might ask : &quot; who is it for ? &quot;
and so what if you could grow a battery in a petri dish ?
what all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale , and they have a dna sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures .
and so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical , but they differ from each other based on their tips , on one sequence that codes for one protein .
the last example are solar cells .
so here &apos;s some examples .
i didn &apos;t actually get meaningful work done .
why do we expect people to work well if they &apos;re being interrupted all day at the office ?
that &apos;s kind of ridiculous . it &apos;s a total decoy .
but meetings also procreate .
this is when people actually get stuff done , is when no one &apos;s bothering them , when no one &apos;s interrupting them .
i live and work from tokyo , japan .
ok , it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask .
ok , so when we did this research , we found the absolutely , 100 percent , guaranteed way to never forget anything ever , ever again .
and i read out that number to them , and they use it to top up their phone .
but what i like about this is , it boils down to someone on the street with a small , flat surface , a screwdriver , a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads -- because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge .
and it &apos;s not necessarily the same values , but some kind of values of livestrong , to actually go out and purchase them , and actually display them .
there &apos;s a significant delta , in fact , between what we &apos;re willing to accept .
renny gleeson : our antisocial phone tricks
thank you .
this idea is nicely captured by this quote : &quot; things without all remedy should be without regard ; what &apos;s done is done . &quot;
these are the classic conditions that create regret .
so the first consistent component of regret is basically denial .
the whole point of acts of idiocy is that they leave you totally uninsured ; they leave you exposed to the world and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility in face of , frankly , a fairly indifferent universe .
and that &apos;s just regret about tattoos .
and ironically , i think it &apos;s probably the single most important thing i possibly could have tattooed onto my body -- partly as a writer , but also just as a human being .
into this mix , people like us , who are not in public office , have more power to do good than at any time in history , because more than half the world &apos;s people live under governments they voted in and can vote out .
but the price went to 140 dollars from 500 .
the systems are not there to reach the people .
she was the youngest partner at schroder ventures in london in her 20s .
we now are treating 325 people a month , despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the aids patients are now treated at home .
i ran away .
the classrooms have natural light .
not many things didn &apos;t work .
all the fences at green school are green .
and we were right .
green school is a model we built for the world .
my carotid artery had ruptured .
even then , i &apos;m aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties .
the flow isn &apos;t natural .
since the first web browser was also developed in urbana , it appears that my hometown in downstate illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual , online universe we occupy today .
ironic that my legs are fine , and it &apos;s my shoulders that slow up my walk .
roger ebert : remaking my voice
other examples you can see here are from latvia , lithuania , estonia -- the central european countries .
why am i asking all of these business questions , instead of just showing them pages ?
i &apos;m tired of you having to come here , harassing us , while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes .
but eventually i started to look human again .
they removed a hematoma from behind my eye .
but on a larger scale of biology , actually symmetry is very important , because it actually communicates genetic information .
the moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls .
can anybody think what else i could do to this which would leave it like i did before i started ?
of course , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
but , using the language of galois , we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same .
now , this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet .
i need your surname . symmetrical objects generally -- spell it for me .
and i could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity , at least in the next few hundred years .
we find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what &apos;s going on .
a number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it .
it was the origin of the xerox copier , which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year .
edward tenner : unintended consequences
also on the web , when the text is too small , what you do is hold down the control key and hit plus , plus , plus .
again , you don &apos;t have to click one of the results .
tech columnist david pogue shares 10 simple , clever tips for computer , web , smartphone and camera users . and yes , you may know a few of these already -- but there &apos;s probably at least one you don &apos;t .
thank you .
and similar topography .
and he said , &quot; it &apos;s funny you ask that , because it &apos;s actually called black box trading .
and so netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years .
so none of this mishegas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want .
this is just theoretical .
or there &apos;s the same thing , but recycled paper , you have to get five of those because they &apos;re not as absorbant , of course .
js : now , there &apos;s now a real fancy invention , it &apos;s the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out .
small roundabouts are starting to appear .
so , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs .
and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to .
now , ironically , what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones , which is where the rich countries are .
but that alone doesn &apos;t give us the road map .
and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year .
and the answer is no .
what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and in fact , these free courses could not only be available just on the internet , but you could make it so that dvds were always available , and so anybody who has access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers .
i love raku because it allows me to play with the elements .
richard serra : i was standing there looking at it , and i realized that velázquez was looking at me , and i thought , &quot; oh . i &apos;m the subject of the painting . &quot;
it gets further and further away from the day , and light and seasons temper it in some way , and it &apos;s not that i &apos;m a romantic . i &apos;m really a realist .
and she walks away , and i &apos;m flattened .
i want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine , and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved .
in the meanwhile , the patient &apos;s on the operating room table .
see , so every single one in the audience now can tell where the cancer is .
that doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s cancer inside .
but what about the part that goes into the tumor ?
and today , architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us .
so just as we manage national parks , where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others , we &apos;re working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors .
if we could activate cells , we could see what powers they can unleash , what they can initiate and sustain .
so these molecules are called channelrhodopsins .
so if these cells can mediate reward , the animal should go there more and more .
if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds , you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they &apos;re embedded .
in many forms of blindness , like retinitis pigmentosa , or macular degeneration , the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed .
je : and in theory , that means that , as a mouse feels , smells , hears , touches , you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros .
people were out .
i think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that &apos;s starting to emerge online right now .
so when i was talking in &quot; emergence , &quot; i talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture that , basically , you could link to somebody else but they wouldn &apos;t necessarily know that you were pointing to them .
and it turns out , actually , that 42 percent is the mola mola fish .
and so something we kind of knew , but you didn &apos;t actually notice syntactically what he was doing .
i hope it continues here .
but the choice was theirs , and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide .
&quot; pickpocket &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
when the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions , it was these teenagers that fed the crew .
our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young .
now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that , our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal .
working memory allows us to investigate our current experience as we move forward .
we need to realize that working memory has a limited capacity , and that working memory capacity itself is how we negotiate that .
the last one is organization and support .
that was one sentence .
so , as kevin kelly pointed out , there is no endgame .
this is a hospital monitor from los angeles , sent to china .
i guess he didn &apos;t read vitruvius .
it means the way olympic athletes train with each other .
we &apos;ve developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains , because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars -- and say , &quot; where does your stuff come from ? &quot; they say , &quot; suppliers . &quot;
we did a mass energy balance -- if they use brick , they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal .
the solar power of all the factory centers and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city .
and this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all .
one way is to sabotage encryption algorithms , which is a great example about how u.s. intelligence agencies are running loose .
all countries spy .
i &apos;m not doing anything bad or anything illegal .
so mr. snowden , he &apos;s been blamed for many things .
20 percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs , 20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart , is servicing this one organ .
so as i mentioned , there are 86 billion neurons .
and we &apos;re very careful about the brains that we do take .
this will then go onto a robot that &apos;s going to apply one of those stains to it .
it &apos;s basically a large data set of information that &apos;s all freely available to any scientist around the world .
and we get confirmation .
disc1 is a gene that &apos;s deleted in schizophrenia .
or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help , on the contrary it might hurt , it might exacerbate corruption , dependence , etc . ?
so you have your million .
and you can do the same randomized , controlled trial for social policy .
we made it easy -- i &apos;ll tell you how in a moment .
one is : if people must pay for a bed net , are they going to purchase them ?
they need to know : out of all the things i could do , what is the best way to achieve my goals ?
so for every hundred dollars you spend doing that , you get 40 extra years of education .
so we cannot eradicate poverty just yet , but we can get started .
because this is where it all really began , isn &apos;t it ?
it all began with a fantastic phone call .
a satellite picture looking down at the earth .
but that &apos;s just part of the story . you have a similar trend with currencies -- currencies going through an extreme time of stability .
undoubtedly , nigeria is clearly a hot spot .
what else is going on there ? egypt .
nigeria : 70 percent of roads are untarred . zambia : 80 percent .
why are they doing that ? because they expect investment to follow .
their beauty immerses us with color , taste , touch .
look at the faces of people whom you meet .
kt : how are you ?
kt : how are you doing this ?
kb : voodoo ?
kb : hold it right there .
you didn &apos;t react to that , so it &apos;s four letters in the title .
tell me when i &apos;m over a cup .
psychologists , figure this out .
if a soldier sees his friend blown up , his brain goes into such high alarm that he can &apos;t actually put the experience into words , so he just feels the horror over and over again .
your pets are happier than you are .
i did what most of us do -- i tried it on some colleagues .
let me show you how we do that .
so to make the experiment , i knew i &apos;d have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly .
so if i do something that hurts you , i feel that pain .
so i said , &quot; i &apos;ll hold it for you . &quot;
we have oxytocin that connects us to others , makes us feel what they feel .
i also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn &apos;t really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers .
come here . give me a hug .
i said schools as we know them now , they &apos;re obsolete .
and they said , &quot; can we touch it ? &quot; i said , &quot; if you wish to . &quot;
i started experimenting with other subjects , among them , for example , pronunciation .
i got an educational impossibility , zero to 30 percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they didn &apos;t know doing something that &apos;s a decade ahead of their time .
it took nature 100 million years to make the ape stand up and become homo sapiens .
watch this .
and if he says , &quot; well , what ? how ? &quot;
i think it was good advice .
and if i go to a club and play a gig , people are like , &quot; here , have some drinks on us ! &quot;
each work that i make is comprised of three segments .
two of his wives were brought to him suffering from infertility and he cured them , three for evil spirits , one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain and two wives ondijo claims he took for love , paying their families a total of 16 cows .
so when you look at a detail of this work , you can see , the man on the upper-left is the father of the woman sitting next to him .
there &apos;s also parents who participated who wouldn &apos;t let their children participate because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves .
in a 12-month period when i was at the orphanage , only one child had been adopted .
but anyway , it &apos;s just great to see such a full theater , and really i must thank herbie hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation .
in the same way , i look at the music ; i get a basic idea ; i wonder what technically might be hard , or , you know , what i want to do .
same amount of weight , but different sound colors .
do you see what i mean ?
so when we do listen to each other , it &apos;s unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills , to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber , to stop the judgment .
not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands .
you know . i need to say something .
christopher poole : when i was 15 , i found this website called futaba channel .
and so there are three that i want to show you specifically .
they are still protesting .
but seriously , this issue on anonymity is -- i mean , you made the case there .
and that content is all off the board now .
cp : that &apos;s a good question .
yes , they do have larger body size , but many of them are smaller , but we &apos;re interested in the time it took them to achieve that .
now , if you want to understand what happened then when the continents broke apart , and dinosaurs found -- landlubbers , as they are -- found themselves adrift . there &apos;s some missing puzzle pieces .
we prototyped by cat-scanning the brain out of this animal .
i got the back legs .
it &apos;s really an island continent .
today i &apos;m going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here talking about the other stuff that i do in chicago , which is related to the fact that i never -- and actually , in talking to a lot of tedsters , there &apos;s a number of you out there -- i don &apos;t know that i &apos;d get an answer honestly , if i asked you to raise your hand , but there are a number of you out there that started your scientific , technical , entertainment career as failures , by society &apos;s standards , as failures by schools .
and i hope to god the united states government , me , or ted , or somebody helps us do that , because that would be an incredible thing for their country .
an ethiopian woman named derartu tulu turns up at the starting line .
and the answer to it , i think , can be found down in the copper canyons of mexico , where there &apos;s a tribe , a reclusive tribe , called the tarahumara indians .
then you go beyond 26 miles , into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans -- remember pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles -- you get to 50 and 100 miles , and suddenly it &apos;s a different game .
you need to have the women and the adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you are a nursing mother and a developing adolescent .
stop focusing on urban marathons , which , if you do four hours , you suck .
cynthia breazeal : so kismet interacted with people like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child , which i assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind .
so given that key insight , we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots .
cory kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work .
what if -- nathan : here it comes . yay !
got to do what i can to make sure i look good , and the reason i have to look real good , well , to tell you the truth , man , i don &apos;t know why . guess it makes me feel special inside .
now he kept on rambling about poetry and styles and nuyorican friday nights .
i &apos;m going to start with how i started with this concept seven years ago , when princess diana died .
all this imagery was creating a lot of fuss and i was cited as a disgusting artist . the press were writing about this , giving full pages about how terrible this was .
but there was a real legal problem because it looks real , but how do you get over that ?
also , people were taking photographs of this , so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly , all this imagery .
so we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain : which cells are communicating with which cells , with which chemicals , and then in what quantities of those chemicals ?
and i looked down at my body and i thought , &quot; whoa , i &apos;m a weird-looking thing . &quot; and it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality , where i &apos;m the person on the machine having the experience , to some esoteric space where i &apos;m witnessing myself having this experience .
and i &apos;m looking at the card on top and even though i could see clearly in my mind &apos;s eye what my business card looked like , i couldn &apos;t tell if this was my card or not , because all i could see were pixels .
and the lesson from new york over the past six years is that you can update this asset .
so it was all about the data .
and that &apos;s twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood .
sixty-four percent of new yorkers support these bike lanes .
in africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored .
in eight short years -- we &apos;re here talking about hiv , malaria , which is all good .
we go for modular units . units that have multi-modality functions have modular components . easy to repair , and because of that , we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last .
it &apos;s not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive , and they go home and can &apos;t do it .
i came to the heart institute in 2006 , as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program .
i think in pictures , i don &apos;t think in language .
they flash up into my memory , just like google for pictures .
and my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control &apos;s .
are they friend or foe ? is there anybody he can go mate with ?
you know , five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years , the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way .
this is the work of dr. bruce miller .
let &apos;s figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance .
and we &apos;ve got to mentor them , hire them .
what are you most passionate about ?
but if you look at creative practice as a form of research , or art as a form of r &amp; amp ; d for humanity , then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research ?
recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform .
they &apos;ve eaten together . they &apos;ve bled together .
i really enjoyed doing this .
so how do we square those two things , that it leads to more arguing , but we think it was good ?
this is feudalism : one owner , many workers .
every git system generates this number the same way , which means this is a signature tied directly and unforgeably to a particular change .
someone going by divegeek has put up the utah code , the laws of the state of utah , and they &apos;ve put it up there not just to distribute the code , but with the very interesting possibility that this could be used to further the development of legislation .
a momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing : trial by jury , voting , peer review , now this . right ?
but even when we did that , we had to remind ourselves , sometimes there are setbacks .
so we literally are all made out of stardust .
as i told you , geologists love craters .
so anyway , let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet .
we no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry , so we jettison the heat shield , exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of mars .
first we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can .
but also , if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff , we have a little laser system which will actually zap the rock , evaporate some of it , and actually analyze what &apos;s coming from that rock .
so this is a yellowstone , you know , of saturn .
the sun is behind saturn , so we see what we call &quot; forward scattering , &quot; so it highlights all the rings . and i &apos;m going to zoom .
and this , indeed , really is tough to say , but a few months later , we realized that we were really feeling like a failure .
roberto d &apos;angelo and francesca fedeli thought their baby boy mario was healthy -- until at 10 days old , they discovered he &apos;d had a perinatal stroke . with mario unable to control the left side of his body , they grappled with tough questions : would he be &quot; normal ? &quot; could he live a full life ? the poignant story of parents facing their fears -- and how they turned them around .
now , i &apos;ve gained some insight into this .
the scan of today takes up about 800 books , or 20 gigabytes .
and these are being augmented even by our devices again today .
now we &apos;ve heard a lot today about new technology and connection .
now how about other exponentials ?
if we go down the small pathway a little bit farther , we &apos;re entering the era of nanomedicine , the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system , or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries .
this has been called by lee hood , the father of the field , p4 medicine .
still a phase i trial , but evolving .
daniel kraft offers a fast-paced look at the next few years of innovations in medicine , powered by new tools , tests and apps that bring diagnostic information right to the patient &apos;s bedside . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
in those days there was still countryside close to the city , farms , cornfields , cows ; even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests .
too many lives in our lives already , too many chances for sorrow , too many unaccounted-for pasts .
her vigil somewhere i know continues .
that she died in the camps made her -- i didn &apos;t dare wonder why -- more present , more precious .
this destructive power takes many different forms .
i &apos;ll show you one photo here , and it &apos;s a photo by eugene richards of an iraq war veteran from an extraordinary piece of work , which has never been published , called war is personal .
the second one is , how do you go to the loo at minus 40 ?
we were too late into the summer ; the ice was starting to melt ; we spoke to the russian helicopter pilots on the radio , and they said , &quot; look boys , you &apos;ve run out of time .
at first it was pretty sensible . we flew british airways to moscow .
later in the expedition , the problem was no longer the ice .
so , kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech .
there are huge areas of open water just south of your position .
the next question is , how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40 ?
he was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric .
and when we run experiments , we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another .
the positive perspective , i think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail , we can actually hope to fix things .
the men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the marquesas islands , 1,200 miles away .
what would happen to our days ? what would happen to our crops ?
a good reader has an artist &apos;s passion , a willingness to get caught up in the story , but just as importantly , the readers also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist , which acts to temper and complicate the reader &apos;s intuitive reactions to the story .
the iraqis : yes , they got rid of saddam hussein , but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad , they felt that their dignity had suffered .
and then we took that decision : we are unrolling the news .
for 18 days , our cameras were broadcasting , live , the voices of the people in tahrir square .
mohamed nanabhay who &apos;s sitting with us , the head of aljazeera.net , he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world .
we were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in bali for a drug injection .
you don &apos;t want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you &apos;re sleeping with .
there is nothing on the other side .
what &apos;s rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it &apos;s really bad for business to have another sti .
aids was a disfiguring disease that killed you , and hiv is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day .
i do speak to sex workers , 15,000 of them for this particular slide , and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour .
hey , hey black-eyed susie , hey .
he said , well , you can go back to clinch mountain , where i &apos;m from , or asheville or mount airy , north carolina -- some place that has a lot of music .
well , it was 1954 , i guess it was .
now , my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work .
it &apos;s usually played flat on your lap .
and he was working on gyroscopes ; he has a number of patents for that kind of thing .
now , the drum triggers go out my tail here , into the drum machine , and they can make various sounds , like drums .
and aristotle &apos;s law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place , which was of course , the rule of the society that aristotle lived in , and more importantly , the medieval society that , through christianity , embraced aristotle and blessed it .
all properties of things are about these kinds of relationships .
in the biological sciences , they explored the implications of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in a self-organized way .
and i get , over time , bored by them .
and then i needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house , and attacked me during my morning walks .
and i was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical .
and i very quickly made a list of the things i was interested in , put them in a hierarchy , divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan , very much like in grade school .
and the software , in a second , will give you the casa da musica beethoven logo .
this is after a week .
and of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile .
300 years ago he &apos;d have been burnt at the stake for that .
&quot; christian principles , christian values .
he summed it up , really , at a dinner .
that &apos;s eight years of american history , eight minutes of my act , just gone like that .
he leaves , people go , &quot; no no no , we &apos;re not going to do that .
&quot; ahh , listen to me mr. titchmarsh . &quot;
every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had .
so this was a problem , and peter dodson pointed this out using some duck-billed dinosaurs then called hypacrosaurus .
and then stygimoloch , another dinosaur from the same age , lived at the same time , has spikes sticking out the back of its head .
so now we know that torosaurus is actually a grownup triceratops .
from urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff .
so , this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do .
in any case , the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls .
so this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it &apos;s quite substantial .
one thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall .
you can see hillary clinton on the right .
i disagree with that .
a voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds .
now , i don &apos;t know if one of the editors was a woman , but that can make the biggest differences .
some 17 years ago , i became allergic to delhi &apos;s air .
madeleine albright : this is &quot; breaking the glass ceiling . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well i &apos;ve been a woman for 60 years , but i &apos;ve only been secretary of state for a few minutes . &quot;
i get there , and there are six other women , out of 183 .
more women &apos;s voices at the table ?
it &apos;s also shown us that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality , because facts , like people , want to be free , and when they &apos;re free , liberty is usually around the corner , even for the poorest of the poor -- facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy that leads to inertia , facts that tell us what &apos;s working and , more importantly , what &apos;s not , so we can fix it , facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that nelson mandela made back in 2005 , when he asked us to be that great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity , extreme poverty , facts that build a powerful momentum .
and if you live on less than $ 1.25 a day , if you live in that kind of poverty , this is not just data .
and the next one is really beautiful .
it &apos;s transformational .
if your bank account &apos;s one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
there are other questions like this , too .
the net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle .
and then you can maybe wash the dna away and have the circuit left over .
it knows when to stop growing because it can count .
you know , so this is all very cool , but what i &apos;d like you to take from the talk , hopefully from some of those big questions , is that this molecular programming isn &apos;t just about making gadgets .
and as you can see from the visuals , the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike .
such a service simply do not exist .
so we actually used the right to information act , which is equal to the freedom of information act in the united states , and pushed back the officers in this particular case .
and so , of course , if you &apos;re going to do this kind of stuff , you need a lot of data .
so as we go in here , what we start to see , apply the physics engine again , we see what &apos;s one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones .
remember , it &apos;s that network structure that is creating these emergent topics , and let &apos;s say we could take two of them , like cities and genetics , and say , well , are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines .
teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here .
virtue is an old-fashioned word .
and finally , perhaps most important , a wise person is made , not born .
well , a judge said yes , but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel .
second , no doubt more familiar to you , is the nature of modern american education : scripted , lock-step curricula .
some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed .
there is no better way to show people that you &apos;re not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course .
but most important to make it work -- and he emphasized this -- is that it took knowing the people in the communities .
and i think he was right .
you &apos;re going to give us an arm . &quot;
&quot; great , &quot; he said , &quot; you got two years . &quot;
imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it , doing either of those .
you could see he was missing an arm .
this kid was from staten island .
what do we need to do ? &quot; there &apos;s very polarized answers to that question too , and i don &apos;t have any answers to that .
it can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
and it ended up being so much fun that i decided i could pursue doing more of these things .
and i was shivering . in my first attempt to hold my breath i couldn &apos;t even last a minute .
that &apos;s holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving .
which is lower than most olympic athletes .
so , it &apos;s like base camp everest .
but for tv they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face , basically .
i started feeling pains all over my chest .
in this highly personal talk from tedmed , magician and stuntman david blaine describes what it took to hold his breath underwater for 17 minutes -- a world record -- and what his often death-defying work means to him . warning : do not try this at home .
this was the fourth take , i &apos;m told .
in the last 20 years , it &apos;s really changed the way that we live and work , and the way that we see the world , and what &apos;s great is , we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift , because now we can literally take the content that we share , we discover , and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us .
when mahatma gandhi was asked , &quot; how do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one or the wrong one ? &quot; he said , &quot; consider the face of the poorest , most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon , and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person .
what will that lead to ?
sub-saharan africa , and even our own san francisco bay area .
all throughout the technology world , we &apos;re seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome .
and i lived in a himalayan monastery , and i studied with a very wise teacher , who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny -- it felt like yoda -- it is your destiny to go to work for who and to help eradicate smallpox , at a time when there was no smallpox program .
i have worked with more than 500 companies .
and every time there is a new requirement , we use the same approach .
how the paths work together .
it can only add new boxes , new bones in the skeleton .
they don &apos;t understand reality and they add the complicatedness of matrix kpis .
you stop drawing boxes , dotted lines , full lines ; you look at their interplay .
by changing our environment , we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve .
and if that were all this was about , then it would be an interesting thing .
and before you get too worried about it , here in the united states , the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it .
and now , using a joystick , they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right , forwards or backwards .
pretty soon , the computer learned , by reading the monkey &apos;s brainwaves , to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey &apos;s arm did .
and so , we need to ask ourselves some questions .
it wasn &apos;t until much longer , much later , that darwin actually spoke and wrote about humans .
and so when we look at a map of skin color , and predicted skin color , as we know it today , what we see is a beautiful gradient from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator , and the lightest ones toward the poles .
so if we &apos;re somewhere in the northern hemisphere , look at what &apos;s happening to the ultraviolet radiation .
some of us with lightly pigmented skin live in high-uv areas .
you don &apos;t have to think about some exotic examples , or fossils .
so let me show you a few objects .
so the eye , after a while , can distinguish these two very well .
enormous disagreements .
mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing , that man can invent things that nature did not know .
so he painted it , which means he put inside everything . he said : &quot; well , this thing came out ... &quot; and i said , &quot; stop ! stop ! stop !
so the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say ? -- model price variation .
and i went from what &apos;s called real numbers , which are points on a line , to imaginary , complex numbers , which are points on a plane , which is what one should do there , and this shape came out .
this shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics .
and since i study human decision making , i said , i &apos;m going to run some studies to find some answers .
anyone ? it &apos;s much more difficult .
for example , very early on in the treatment , things are negative , the feedback , before things become positive .
and why not ?
another notable economist , theodore schultz , in 1974 won the nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient , but poor .
it also has very high cost implications .
we now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives , but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market .
now , in ethiopia , we &apos;re in the process of designing the first organized ethiopia commodity exchange .
it will stop them from doing simple , back-to-back , limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from &#91; surplus regions &#93; to &#91; deficit areas &#93; .
one billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second .
so , they moved the entire village , hut by hut .
he managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes .
if nothing else , i would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion .
i realized that the truly appropriate , low-cost tools that i needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn &apos;t exist yet .
thank you .
but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency , this is the picture that you come up with .
but the humble latrine , or flush toilet , reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water .
she gets a dose of healthy human feces , and the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent .
she left .
people go out and upgrade their toilet .
we know that hurricanes have always happened in the past . &quot;
what that was , was a forest of sponges and coral , which is a critical habitat for the development of fish .
and then this is amazing .
you all know this story .
and what would be behind those rubber masks , if they were ?
one : whitley strieber was played by christopher walken .
the stars aligned , and she came back .
how clever would we have to be ?
but the materiality matters too , because in every society that anthropologists have looked at , material stuff operates as a kind of language -- a language of goods , a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories -- stories , for example , about how important we are .
in the crisis , in the recession , what do people want to do ?
mary douglas asked in an essay on poverty written 35 years ago .
so we can do that here -- we can just put in a little search term .
so let me come back , with this sense of hope , to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door .
actually , i already am seeing a little bit of it .
i wanted to think about what else i could put shadows on , and i thought of my friend bernie .
i came together with a collaborator , sheila vand , and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface , and that was milk .
then there &apos;s all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon .
i &apos;ve talked to engineers . that &apos;s specifically to diffuse our anger , because supposedly we feel good about atms .
but what &apos;s really amazing is that ida tarbell , the journalist , went in and did a big exposé of rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place .
and we have this kind of -- as voters , we have kind of a &quot; eureka ! &quot; moment .
if you look at people who make $ 50,000 a year , they have two kids , they might have three jobs or more , and then they have to really commute .
this is a gas receipt , hypothetically , for a year from now .
a lot of people , when they hear the word &quot; sexual orientation &quot; think it means gay , lesbian , bisexual .
but we &apos;ve demonstrated that john has long ago left the conversation .
and then what is the role of the various institutions in our society that are helping to produce abusive men at pandemic rates ?
but it &apos;s the truth . and so one of the things that i say to men , and my colleagues and i always say this , is we need more men who have the courage and the strength to start standing up and saying some of this stuff , and standing with women and not against them and pretending that somehow this is a battle between the sexes and other kinds of nonsense .
it &apos;s along a continuum , we &apos;re trying to get men to interrupt each other .
now , i know it &apos;s a bit pompous , my response , but it &apos;s an important distinction , because i don &apos;t believe that what we need is sensitivity training .
we need more men with the guts , with the courage , with the strength , with the moral integrity to break our complicit silence and challenge each other and stand with women and not against them .
people watch it all over the country also in public places .
and in this program , people present policy platforms that are then voted on .
and with a population increasing as quickly as it is , and with the water supply from these glaciers -- because of climate change -- decreasing so much , i think we have a real risk of instability .
the first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to work in the future .
this is called the registry of standard biological parts .
that &apos;s a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans .
so we &apos;ve got autonomous replication of bit strings .
and literally with only those two inputs -- so , the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure -- you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error , from minus 12 to plus eight diopters , up to four diopters of cylinder .
and if you &apos;ve seen amy smith , she talks about how you get students at mit to work with communities in haiti .
that &apos;s , to put it mildly , not what &apos;s on the table now .
increasingly , we &apos;re realizing that we don &apos;t even need to densify an entire city .
okay . i do too .
and if we have another eight billion or seven billion , or six billion , even , people , living on a planet where their cities also steal the future , we &apos;re going to run out of future really fast .
what about one-on-one murder ? well , there , there are good statistics , because many municipalities recorded the cause of death .
now , one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence .
steven pinker : the surprising decline in violence
they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv , put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them , show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .
and i like that definition , because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset .
and what has happened in the world , i will show now .
this is the income distribution of peoples in the world , from $ 1 . this is where you have food to eat .
now all your different departments .
and how fast has this happened ?
okay . i give you singapore , the year i was born .
it &apos;s caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation .
but i didn &apos;t , ok . so we &apos;re here . i &apos;ll do what i can . i &apos;ll do what i can .
i want to stress , you know , social organization can transcend political bounds .
we have this non-zero-sum relationship , and i think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone else &apos;s welfare is positively correlated with yours -- you &apos;re more likely to cut them a break .
it sounds so kind of pollyannaish . i feel like rodney king , you know , saying , why can &apos;t we all just get along ?
there are people who worry about this , and in fact , i , myself , apparently , was denounced on national tv a couple of nights ago because of an op-ed i &apos;d written .
an average african country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13 , 15 percent of its gdp , and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries .
wealth is a function of income , and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job .
under the cotonou agreement , formerly known as the lome convention , african countries have been given an opportunity by europe to export goods , duty-free , to the european union market .
why ? because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business -- it requires that you listen to the people , the private sector actors in that industry .
why does the government of uganda budget spend 110 percent of its own revenue ?
when i was president of the american psychological association , they tried to media-train me , and an encounter i had with cnn summarizes what i &apos;m going to be talking about today , which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic .
and now , when i tell people what i do , they move toward me .
it should be interested in the best things in life .
this is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can , and the skills to amplify it .
he &apos;s not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that &apos;s because len , like most of you , is enormously capable of flow .
i mentioned that for all three kinds of lives , the pleasant life , the good life , the meaningful life , people are now hard at work on the question , are there things that lastingly change those lives ?
and this is really what you &apos;re about . and that &apos;s our target variable .
and it turns out the skills of happiness , the skills of the pleasant life , the skills of engagement , the skills of meaning , are different from the skills of relieving misery .
photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today &apos;s saturated , media world , because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment .
but what nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight , &quot; isn &apos;t this an amazing world ? &quot;
but there are also glimmers of hope , and i think anytime we &apos;re doing a big , big story on this , we don &apos;t really want to go and just look at all the problems .
so , she is pretty significant in size .
the way that we did this is we tried to start with emily herself , who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in marina del rey , and sit for a session in light stage 5 .
but they basically created a digital puppet of her , where you can pull on these various strings , and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took .
and my father was a soldier , and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher .
you can &apos;t speak lingala because lingala was from mobutu , and everyone speaking lingala is soldier .
and the reserve was a target to the rebels .
and one day , we went for a meeting .
wildlife conservation society more dealing with plants .
thank you , thank you .
it &apos;s basically like a tree collecting water coming down .
exploration is a physical process of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before .
this is the target site , the world &apos;s deepest hydrothermal spring at cenote zacaton in northern mexico .
something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime .
and the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon .
i like this equipment , you know , and i really value it so we &apos;re not going to burn the gear .
today , there are very few things that money can &apos;t buy .
the difference is this : a market economy is a tool , a valuable and effective tool , for organizing productive activity , but a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale .
and how many would be opposed ? how many would -- so the majority here are opposed , but a sizable minority are in favor .
will they have learned that reading is a chore , a form of piecework to be done for pay , that &apos;s the worry , or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake ?
thank you very much .
then growth gets better and better .
but now it &apos;s turned around .
electricity was also very helpful in liberating women .
and an amazing fact for techno-optimists is that in the first half of the 20th century , the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster than it was in the second half of the 19th century .
the us economy has been expanding wildly for two centuries . are we witnessing the end of growth ? economist robert gordon lays out 4 reasons us growth may be slowing , detailing factors like epidemic debt and growing inequality , which could move the us into a period of stasis we can &apos;t innovate our way out of . be sure to watch the opposing viewpoint from erik brynjolfsson .
because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . what are the influences ?
what are we supposed to do ?
what are things that you get from the universe that you can &apos;t really explain ?
and , of course , as westerners , we say , &quot; well , it was an accident . that &apos;s not fair .
because for everything , in that question of how things happen , it has to do with the feeling .
you take the profit from that to buy more ads .
now , i had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated tv commercial featuring tom arnold , that would get you to get in your car , drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich .
because people saw it and said -- i didn &apos;t know that was there -- and they noticed it .
but market to these people because they care .
this hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars , 10 times the standard .
that &apos;s risky . the safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes , be remarkable .
and then an artist came to them -- this is a true artist &apos;s rendering -- he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town .
in front of this tank there &apos;s a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head . to any passerby , there &apos;s no problem with this visual .
most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward , romanticizing the past .
but as i got more involved in the story , i realized that there were two big environmental issues i couldn &apos;t ignore .
these are the lions and tigers of the sea .
this ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in national geographic .
it &apos;s not what you typically might think of as a shark picture .
the north atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales ; they live along the east coast of north america , united states and canada , and they have to deal with all these urban ills .
for example , these fish predate on sea urchins , and when the fish were all gone , all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins .
she &apos;s now living in the jungle of sungai wain , and this is matahari , her second son , which , by the way , is also the son of the second orangutan i rescued , dodoy .
still , four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people .
this is how it looks like in practice . we have this grass we want to get rid of .
for three months , the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark .
we could have planted many , many more , but we didn &apos;t want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable .
rainfall is up .
we have our farmer schools .
i hope -- if you want to know more , you can read more .
strings attached to dancers .
do you think you &apos;re designing one thing , and then when it &apos;s produced it looks like something else ?
speaking about the design : every city has its own design .
i &apos;ll speak on this later on .
we don &apos;t rip our family portrait , even if we don &apos;t like the nose of our uncle , because this portrait is you .
you &apos;re going to make the music and the rhythm .
either it doesn &apos;t exist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some damn fool thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science .
now , that &apos;s the common-sense definition . that &apos;s our target .
okay . another feature of consciousness is that it comes in unified conscious fields .
it &apos;s got a semantics .
well , think about the distinction between feeling a pain and engaging in pain behavior .
but this is a crisis of , not natural resources -- though i believe that &apos;s true -- but a crisis of human resources .
every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it &apos;s not enough .
and many of our ideas have been formed , not to meet the circumstances of this century , but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries .
but , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
and he said , &quot; it was humiliating because he said it in front of the whole class and i really felt dreadful .
you know there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
and you cannot predict the outcome of human development .
so it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language .
what &apos;s the origin of this ?
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to budapest . &quot;
and she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her .
and that &apos;s the basis on which we have to talk with them .
now that to me is wisdom in action .
i &apos;m going to tell you about why i became a sculptor , and you may think that sculptors , well , they deal with meta , they deal with objects , they deal with bodies , but i think , really , what i care about most is making space , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve called this talk : making space .
this was a wonderful place , because it was a place where you could imagine that you were the first person to be there .
if minds live in bodies , if bodies live in clothes , and then in rooms , and then in buildings , and then in cities , do they also have a final skin , and is that skin perceptual ?
you are now consciousness without an object , freed from the dimensionful and measured way in which life links us to the obligatory .
but i realized , for that to be true -- for theft of our children &apos;s future to be a crime -- there must be a clear , demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children &apos;s future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator -- in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .
fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables .
there is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
on a tuesday morning in march of 1996 , i was talking to people , as i did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether i was connecting .
now , i &apos;m convinced a lot of you probably share my passions , especially my passion for judge judy , and you &apos;d fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us , but i &apos;m a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life , a passion for the live professional performing arts , performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire , yes , but jazz as well , modern dance , opera , theater and more and more and more .
and at heart , both reformations , i think were asking the questions : who &apos;s entitled to practice ?
today &apos;s performers , like rhodessa jones , work in women &apos;s prisons , helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration , while today &apos;s playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more .
it was more atonal and twelve-tone .
and so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility -- and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech .
and john heinz did give me a million bucks .
the kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago -- he &apos;s now an instructor .
he was dragging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the lord .
and i recorded dizzy . and he died a year later , but not before telling a fellow named mccoy tyner what we were doing .
so , the hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city .
and he got me five acres of land on san francisco bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got herbie on the board , and our friends from hp , and our friends from steelcase , and our friends from cisco , and our friends from wells fargo and genentech .
in my business it &apos;s very difficult work .
so as you can see , the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder-transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns -- and it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s pretty good -- and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic , the responses really don &apos;t .
and the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment , they grow to twice their size , they cut themselves down in the middle , and one cell becomes two , and so on and so on .
we &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here .
what &apos;s important for today &apos;s talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions .
they all have a species-specific system -- they have a molecule that says &quot; me . &quot;
in this one i &apos;m just using the interspecies molecule , but the logic is exactly the same .
what we &apos;re also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you , in the hopes of making you more healthy , making those conversations better , so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own .
according to aristotle , justice means giving people what they deserve .
aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players .
and how many would not ? how many would say he doesn &apos;t ?
what &apos;s your name ?
it &apos;s interesting because he rejected the aristotelian premise underlying the majority &apos;s opinion .
the opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage , fundamentally , is procreation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging .
so you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of conversation , inviting questions , but with people from china and india joining in ?
it &apos;s ecologically sound ; it stops the population explosion of foxes . &quot;
the geriatrician will intervene late in the day , when pathology is becoming evident , and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time , and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon .
so , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .
i &apos;m going to use this word &quot; damage &quot; to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology .
however , it &apos;s better than that ; we actually know how to fix them all , in mice , in principle -- and what i mean by in principle is , we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade .
audience : i was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo , and that the brain cells last 80 years or so .
and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients .
einstein said that this was the definition of insanity -- to do the same things over and over again , hoping for a different outcome .
halla tomasdottir managed to take her company audur capital through the eye of the financial storm in iceland by applying 5 traditionally &quot; feminine &quot; values to financial services . at tedwomen , she talks about these values and the importance of balance .
these changes and others like them changed the way that portlanders live , and their vehicle-miles traveled per day , the amount that each person drives , actually peaked in 1996 , has been dropping ever since , and they now drive 20 percent less than the rest of the country .
some people gained weight , some people didn &apos;t gain weight .
do you know where it &apos;s three per 100,000 ?
if you love nature , the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it , move to a city , and the denser the better , and the denser cities like manhattan are the cities that perform the best .
the driving cities in the sun belt , the dallases and the phoenixes and , sorry , atlanta , these cities are not appearing on the list .
the second reason is that we killed these things .
and he thought about it , and he went to his deep freezer , minus 20 degrees centigrade , and he poured through everything in the freezer , and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs .
we &apos;re excited . we &apos;ve got to get past this point .
at any rate , it was a fascinating place , but unfortunately , australia didn &apos;t stay this way .
the guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup and they pickled it in alcohol .
critics of this project say , hang on .
he has personal experiences that i would give my left leg to have in my head .
this particular one came in out of the forest to lick this boy and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep . a wild animal .
i want to remind you again -- i know you saw these statistics before -- from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion .
the microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there .
from 1967 to &apos; 70 , nigeria fought a war -- the nigeria-biafra war .
you just want the person to be alive !
we also have private citizens now who have a lot of money -- some of them in this audience , with private foundations .
how can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations , with the international organizations , and with our private sector .
one idea .
by 2010 , i had also been asked by the kresge foundation and the city of detroit to join them in leading a citywide planning process for the city to create a shared vision for its future .
during that same period , between 1950 and 2000 , 2010 , the city loses 60 percent of its population , and today it hovers at above 700,000 .
so 2010 , we started this process , and by 2013 , we released detroit future city , which was our strategic plan to guide the city into a better and more prosperous and more sustainable existence -- not what it was , but what it could be , looking at new ways of economic growth , new forms of land use , more sustainable and denser neighborhoods , a reconfigured infrastructure and city service system , and a heightened capacity for civic leaders to take action and implement change .
i think -- how can this possibly be ?
it sends out what &apos;s called a midi signal -- or a musical instrument digital interface -- through these wires into the box and then the computer , which then trigger high-quality piano samples like this .
so this is a twelve-bar blues .
and so i &apos;ve always been fascinated by free-style .
emmanuel : top of the beat with no repeat rhythm and rhyme make me complete climb is sublime when i &apos;m on the mic spittin &apos; rhymes that &apos;ll hit you like a lightning strike i search for the truth in this eternal quest i &apos;m passing on fashion ; you can see how i &apos;m dressed cl : okay . so i &apos;m going to stop that there . so what do we see in his brain ?
someone always asks the math teacher , &quot; am i going to use calculus in real life ? &quot; and for most of us , says arthur benjamin , the answer is no . he offers a bold proposal on how to make math education relevant in the digital age .
now on to the detection algorithms .
eg : losing concentration .
my company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas .
so a simple idea , which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in africa and around the world .
so we hope this year to prototype each of these devices .
or you could spray .
once upon a time , this was the primary technique , and , in fact , many countries got rid of malaria through ddt .
mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs .
an interesting thing is , we kill them all the time ; we &apos;ve never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair .
tables : forestry commission .
okay , it &apos;s a small kitchen . it &apos;s about five square meters .
the whole thing is electric , the restaurant and the kitchen .
really important .
let me take you back two years ago in my life .
but my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine .
but what i was sure of was my innocence .
it was about living two totally different perceptions of my personality , of my person -- the villain back in my home country , and the hero outside .
thank you .
thank you , everyone .
it &apos;s also kind of a protest , a personal protest , against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert , and they &apos;re disturbing you .
i think everyone would have a different interpretation of it .
theo jansen : my creations , a new form of life
so , substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially .
when we did these experiments , though , we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn &apos;t transplant and boot up a cell .
so in the remaining information , in the watermarks , contain the names of , i think it &apos;s 46 different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds ?
but every time i thought i was beginning to get a handle on the koran -- that feeling of &quot; i get it now &quot; -- it would slip away overnight , and i &apos;d come back in the morning wondering if i wasn &apos;t lost in a strange land , and yet the terrain was very familiar .
the word used four times is houris , rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts , or as fair , high-bosomed virgins .
the queen just lays the eggs . there &apos;s no management .
they go out , they get the food , they dig the nest , and the queen never comes out again .
and that &apos;s the process that i call task allocation .
and curiously , and interestingly , it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing .
and what i wanted to know was , &quot; ok , here &apos;s a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited -- is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks ? &quot;
when i do these experiments with older colonies -- so ones that are five years or older -- they &apos;re much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic . the worse things get , the more i hassle them , the more they act like undisturbed colonies .
they &apos;ve gone out to do different tasks , and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines , or influences , each ant &apos;s decision about whether to go out , and which task to perform .
so this is the kind of rule that , as the colony develops and gets older and larger , will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one .
that &apos;s their problem . &quot;
that &apos;s the stigma .
and i believe that we can .
if you shoot a gun through the middle , nothing happens .
laser micro-machining : essentially 3d printers that digitally fabricate functional systems , all the way up to building buildings , not by having blueprints , but having the parts code for the structure of the building .
the students hijacked all the machines i bought to do personal fabrication .
the projection of digital fabrication isn &apos;t a projection for the future ; we are now in the pdp era .
but my subject is national security .
i would bet there aren &apos;t 10 percent of you in the room that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world .
when you look at the biggest user and the second largest user , we use 20 million barrels and the chinese use 10 .
look at the bar on the left . it &apos;s 24 trillion .
if we could do that , i think we would take our first step to an energy plan .
i &apos;m not a big natural gas producer .
does that make sense ?
the first frack job was in &apos; 47 .
if someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution , are you ready to invest in those technologies , even if they aren &apos;t maximized for profits , they might be maximized for the future health of the planet ?
but you had the same thing with the gold rush . &quot; gold . gold . gold . &quot;
so there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships .
jeff bezos : it &apos;s very difficult to figure out what that ad is for .
all the streets had to be torn up .
these never really caught on either : the electric shoe warmer and drier . never a big seller .
that was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances -- because it didn &apos;t make any sense .
they have to -- typically , they come three times .
i &apos;m going to talk about compassion and the golden rule from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective .
again , i know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past , but from a biologist &apos;s point of view , this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self-serving too .
the israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them , but they impose one on gaza , and they say , &quot; well , the palestinians , or some of them , have brought this on themselves . &quot;
in a war , two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game .
and there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people aren &apos;t aware of .
and , similarly , the person in iran : when you try to humanize somebody in america who said that islam is evil , they &apos;ll have trouble with that .
and that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data .
so , alice was very outgoing and sociable , and george was a recluse .
and that isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t want to , it &apos;s really because they can &apos;t .
but he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence .
it &apos;s about nine feet high .
it &apos;s the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet .
and in fact , pretty soon we &apos;ll hear the sound .
we had tree ring analysts from the university of arizona join us on the expedition .
in fact , it was the highest-operating mine in nevada , and it ran year round .
as it happens , there are no trails anywhere on mount washington , just a few old mining roads like this , so you have to bushwhack everywhere .
and i &apos;m going , &quot; careful , careful . please be careful . &quot;
now , if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs , it &apos;s 600 foot , just about a yard to the left of kurt bollacker &apos;s foot , there is a 600-foot drop . he &apos;s ambling on over to zander &apos;s siq .
ok , let &apos;s take one more look at the mountain itself .
and what we found is that male lions are not the lazy hunters we thought them to be .
this is how we see a rainforest , in kaleidoscopic color that tells us that there are many species living with one another .
and we can go to the biggest swamp in the western amazon .
we flew over this same river , imaged the system in 3d .
but what &apos;s good is that the technology we &apos;ve developed and we &apos;re working with in south africa , for example , is allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna , and then through repeat flights we &apos;re able to see which trees are being pushed over by elephants , in the red as you see on the screen , and how much that &apos;s happening in different types of landscapes in the savanna .
so , why doesn &apos;t it do it ?
what does that mean ?
so , you can imagine the amount of skepticism i received -- couldn &apos;t get money , couldn &apos;t do a whole lot of other things , but i &apos;m so glad it all worked out .
so , it &apos;s a new way of thinking about cancer , it &apos;s a hopeful way of thinking about cancer .
so the cell acts like an embryo . what an exciting thing .
let &apos;s take a look at winnipeg . how many of you , in the last 24 hours -- think back -- have told a little fib , or a big one ? how many have told a little lie out there ?
you just didn &apos;t want to respond to that person that time .
now , let &apos;s put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms , which i &apos;m sure none of you have been in .
and what we found was very , very interesting .
so there are some pathological liars , but they make up a tiny portion of the population . we lie for a reason .
remember , i study deception . i can tell if you don &apos;t raise your hand .
my outbox for email is massive , and i never look at it . i write all the time , but i never look at my record , at my trace .
man 9 : google , say &quot; delicious &quot; in thai .
and this is now , 15 years later , sort of the first form factor that i think can deliver that vision when you &apos;re out and about on the street talking to people and so forth .
i lie awake . i think thoughts . i walk aimlessly .
whether they &apos;re kind of glorified in this way , or whether they &apos;re kind of , you know , ironically glorified , or whether they &apos;re , you know , sort of denigrated , or ironically denigrated .
i don &apos;t know how to put this .
and frankly , i don &apos;t really know what to call myself .
i want to stay out of the way .
im : oh , it &apos;s so fabulous !
chef : oh .
well , that &apos;s it . thank you very much .
if we look at islamists , if we look at the phenomenon of far-right fascists , one thing they &apos;ve been very good at , one thing that they &apos;ve actually been exceeding in , is communicating across borders , using technologies to organize themselves , to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena .
and the consequences that this is having is that it &apos;s affecting the political climate across europe .
it &apos;s comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders .
that we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that -- we associate believing in the universality of our values -- with extremists .
neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply-led approach to impose democratic values from the top down .
that doesn &apos;t guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values .
it &apos;s actually a wind-chill factor which is lower than a summer day on mars .
it &apos;s the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall .
and there were climbers on that summit ridge .
our two strongest climbers , todd burleson and pete athans , decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going .
but rob was now too weak to come down himself , and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude , he was just beyond rescue and he knew it .
he said he had gotten lost in the storm , collapsed in the snow , and just laid there , unable to move .
beck is powering down .
there were five climbers lost here .
the first is really the notion of people .
today we live in a country which sells eight million mobile phones a month , of which 90 percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people don &apos;t have credit history .
but today i believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement .
at the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector , and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for .
it &apos;s important because you need it to solve the world &apos;s environment problems .
he gave me my pick of units .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
one of the things i &apos;d like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about .
sp : we like to give these insurgents a fair chance .
i don &apos;t think there was anything left from his abdominal down .
five soldiers filmed the entire time .
there were not americans hurt out there .
and he said , &quot; my gunner was throwing candy . &quot;
secondly , a political theorist who &apos;s going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about .
basically people start to understand that they can change governments , but they cannot change policies .
and if you go to 1989 -- something that basically you don &apos;t expect that anybody &apos;s going to criticize -- but many are going to tell you , &quot; listen , it was the end of the cold war that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in western europe . &quot;
we are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust .
in britain , 63 percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re-offend again within a year .
so in march 2010 , we signed the first social impact bond with the ministry of justice around peterborough prison .
essex only pays in the event that it &apos;s saving them care costs .
and this creates a structure through which they can combine .
i was on my way home from the airport . i got a job .
every country — iranians , sometimes we do two , sometimes we do three .
that way no one knows what you &apos;re saying . life goes on .
yeah ! all right ! most of brisbane &apos;s here . that &apos;s good .
in a highly entertaining performance , beatboxer tom thum slings beats , comedy and a mouthful of instrumental impersonations into 11 minutes of creativity and fun that will make you smile .
we must change everything .
it &apos;s just a lesion formed inside .
so i &apos;d like you to meet john .
it elevates the temperature .
i mean , one of the messages i like to carry over is , what about defending quality of life ?
he had to sit on a cushion , stand still , not move , because it was very painful .
and this will take time .
she &apos;s rooting around , she finds this one jacket by balenciaga -- she loves it .
we think of it as maybe too silly , too unnecessary .
well , that &apos;s one reason we had a conference here at usc a few years ago .
he has complained a lot about people copying him , but in one interview i read , he said it has really forced him to up his game .
and that &apos;s sort of like the novelty standard for a u.s. patent , which fashion designers never get -- rarely get here in the states .
they thought it &apos;d be more innovative without it .
no protection .
i selected 2,000 years as my minimum age because i wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there .
this is a brain coral living in tobago that &apos;s around 2,000 years old .
so as you can see , it &apos;s in a churchyard ; it &apos;s in scotland . it &apos;s behind a protective wall .
this is the clonal creosote bush , which is around 12,000 years old .
to understand the world that live in , we tell stories .
so imagine if every video that we watched on the web worked like the web , completely remixable , linked to its source content , and interactive for everyone who views it .
on the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
so they said , &quot; we probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot;
we did a study where we looked at oecd data .
we &apos;re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
i study the future of crime and terrorism , and frankly , i &apos;m afraid .
they were armed with mobile phones .
during the mumbai siege , terrorists were so dependent on technology that several witnesses reported that as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand , they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand .
many of you will remember this super cute video from the last ted , but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute .
terrorists understand this . hackers understand this .
the technologies got better , and now dna sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of moore &apos;s law .
this would be the natural government response , to hide away all our government leaders in hermetically sealed bubbles .
they call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement .
&quot; better immersion than to live untouched . &quot;
and one of the women was agnes -- there on your extreme left -- she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in rwanda , and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of rwanda .
at acumen fund , we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital -- money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity , but as full-bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions .
and so i asked jawad , &quot; how do you guys navigate ? this is a really diverse community .
we need leaders .
before we go into these faces , i should explain why i have some right to talk about them .
in fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant .
every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the plasticity , the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine .
i don &apos;t have to be in a behavioral context .
these are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool .
it &apos;s all about cortical processing and forebrain specialization .
we knew that they were going to be slow cognitively ; we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities ; and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read .
such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain .
you can look down in the brain of a child in a variety of tasks that scientists have at stanford , and mit , and ucsf , and ucla , and a number of other institutions .
of course a lot of people will ignore this advice .
because it &apos;s an arranged marriage , not a love marriage .
why not make myself a low-cost napkin ?
and perhaps the best place to start is with my late father .
i mean , just to put it in perspective , 27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool .
i was hyperventilating so much , and within seconds my hands were numb .
there were open patches of sea everywhere .
audience : encore !
you take about eight or so carbon atoms , about 20 hydrogen atoms , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid : very energy-dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels .
now , i &apos;ll tell you another little , very important story about this picture .
it &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3,000 times tougher than this .
and so i came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series .
but i wanted interviews that were different .
in fact , the first person i interviewed was george abbott , who was 97 , and abbott was filled with the life force -- i guess that &apos;s the way i think about it -- filled with it .
it &apos;s pre-programmed . it &apos;s infomercial , and we all have infomercials about our lives .
and i was dying . she was absolutely not giving me a thing .
then at a certain moment , the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed , completely composed .
he said , &quot; you know , i &apos;ve read everything , and sometimes mr. jefferson would smooth the truth a bit . &quot;
and she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life .
here &apos;s the thing , everybody loves a beautiful baby .
so the idea here is , unlike the concept car , we want to marry something beautiful with something that actually works .
this is an american foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region .
and keep in mind , mom maybe just had a c-section , so that &apos;s already kind of a bummer .
so from the very beginning we started by talking to manufacturers .
are we designing for the world that we have ?
so everybody knew this is a , not a useless project , this is an absolute damaging , a terrible project -- not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars , and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools , like hospitals and so on .
and this is why i &apos;m telling you this : civil society rose to the occasion .
why ? because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of great britain .
thank you .
how does vermeer know her ?
he &apos;s an 18th-century french painter best known for his still lifes , but he did occasionally paint people .
he managed to make the word tender .
some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars .
and not only had the support , i found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure .
i mean , 90 percent of the population will watch nollywood .
see you . bye .
but always with a smile , always with an enthusiasm , that is incredible .
no legends , no fairytales .
so it &apos;s safe to say that there are 2,000 films .
i either convince clients at the end that i solve their problems , or i really do solve their problems , because usually they seem to like it .
and after we failed , i just kept failing .
couldn &apos;t find it .
p for palladio .
and it was this interaction between that kind of , up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting .
and that little dome in there is a building by stanley tigerman .
that solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon -- and so it was an opportunity that i seized , because i didn &apos;t have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form .
there &apos;s a railroad track .
the landscape is being built around to create a private garden .
you go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour , and there &apos;s another bridge here .
and the idea was to make this express the energy of this .
i &apos;m so cunning and clever -- i made it quiet and wonderful .
and we tried many shapes , trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical , acceptable format .
we showed this to the hotel people the other day , and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz-carlton anymore , because of this fish .
there &apos;s a definite difference .
we &apos;re trying to struggle to find our identity .
so this is a photograph of henry , two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone , his upper jaw , his eye-socket .
they feel that they &apos;ve actually gained what they never had , that their face now reflects their personality .
we think we can judge people on their expressions .
it &apos;s skin from his back .
and the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research .
these are -- 10 companies control much of what &apos;s in our grocery stores , much of what people eat . and that &apos;s really , really a problem .
we cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart .
and why can they serve that much ?
there &apos;s a lot of stuff we can do . there &apos;s a lot of schools doing farm-to-school programs . there &apos;s a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools .
where is socialization ? where is discussion ?
you know , if you have kids coming into lunch and all they &apos;re going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess , you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside .
200 billion .
many architects seemed to think that when you design , you design a jewel , and it &apos;s a jewel that you try and crave for .
what it showed me is that there &apos;s a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller , and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility , but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change .
we just don &apos;t know how to show this . &quot;
i can see chris looking at me slyly .
she &apos;s 70 years old . this is what fema gave her .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s how he wanted to spend the party .
and what that means is that a designer can -- the siyathemba project i showed was the first ever building to have a creative commons license on it .
and so you know , i want these -- and i just should note , i have two laptops and one of them there , is there and that has 3000 designs on it . if i drop that laptop , what happens ?
these clouds can grow so big , up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere .
and the urban planner in london goes , &quot; what do you mean , who &apos;s in charge of london &apos;s — i mean , no one is in charge . &quot;
but it was fun anyway .
i was alone on foot .
regarding the word &quot; patient , &quot; when i first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer , i noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who &apos;s not in the room here , somebody out there .
obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then .
this is much sharper than an ultrasound would be .
totally by coincidence , there &apos;s that thing in my lung .
this amazing substance -- again i mentioned , where does my body end ?
she studied health care like me .
this is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks .
let patients help .
but this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine .
but one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment . they use echolocation .
and what i want to do tonight is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat , and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings .
well , i believe we just look at nature &apos;s experiments .
this bat is myotis brandtii . it &apos;s the longest-living bat .
we need compassion to get ourselves started , and enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious .
before the war , your security policy had been isolationist .
will it be taken ?
it &apos;s countries like nigeria , which are worse off than if they &apos;d never had oil .
people wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of revenue .
and so i realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry .
so this is gallbladder surgery .
so to lift this education and training worldwide is a very large task , something i &apos;m very personally excited about as we travel around the world .
and there isn &apos;t always a translator available .
we &apos;re working with the folks at ibm research from the accessibility center to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator .
as we think about intersecting technologies -- everybody has a cell phone with a camera -- we could use this everywhere , whether it be health care , patient care , engineering , law , conferencing , translating videos .
i was mesmerized .
i &apos;m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time -- like an x-ray of the city &apos;s circulatory system unfolding .
and after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes , it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed .
when peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peter &apos;s mind taking place .
now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality -- questions of good and evil and right and wrong -- are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
and morality relates to these truths .
the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child -- this is in proverbs 13 and 20 , and i believe , 23 .
now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; don &apos;t lose your queen , &quot; is very good to follow .
now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
and so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face -- i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
and then , within zoology , i took the course or the discipline of entomology , the science of insects .
you see the mother in between and two daughters , probably on the left and right , and a single egg on the right-hand side .
here we are talking a parasite -- not a two-legged parasite , but an eight-legged parasite , of course .
this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults .
and this is the whole bunch of predatory mites .
fortunately , in either biological control or even natural control , resistance is extremely rare .
shimon steinberg : natural pest control ... using bugs !
this is auto-gyro jousting in malibu in the 30s .
and i love cigars -- there &apos;s a cigar billboard down there .
it &apos;s the little old lady that lives in a shoe , and then this thing -- the title of that was , &quot; there goes the neighborhood . &quot;
what i know about this topic comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two .
it starts with a plan .
in either case , do not settle .
in ad 984 vikings went out to greenland , settled greenland , and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed , and every one of them ended up dead .
in a petri dish , bacteria grow . say they double every generation , and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15 / 16ths empty , and then the next generation &apos;s 3 / 4ths empty , and the next generation half empty . within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty , it is full . there &apos;s no more food and the bacteria have collapsed .
and the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades .
it was 80 billion u.s. dollars .
some fruits get some insect damage .
in the developed world it &apos;s on average 80 kilograms per person per year , which goes up to 120 in the united states and a bit lower in some other countries , but on average 80 kilograms per person per year .
so far we &apos;re taking the one , or up to five kilograms of output .
on the right-hand side you see a grasshopper .
well in the netherlands , we have an innovative minister of agriculture , and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry .
electric saw , power drill , totally disgusting unless you &apos;re david bolinsky , in which case it &apos;s all truth and beauty .
in fact , when we &apos;re traveling abroad , it &apos;s how we identify fellow canadians .
allison hunt : how to get hip
the bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete .
step four is i then move the rete , move the sky , so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back .
and advancing retes became cultural emblems .
and what you see over here is a very popular video game , and in this fiction they describe these alien creatures that are robots that have three legs that terrorize earth .
we are literally re-inventing the wheel here .
we developed our adaptive gait planner .
it can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg , or in this case , a lightbulb .
and now darwin ii is completely autonomous .
where do we come up with these ideas ?
batman , fighting against bad guys , he has his utility belt , he has his grappling hook , he has all different kinds of gadgets .
it &apos;s downtowns becoming ghost towns .
so it sounds like i &apos;m painting a really bleak picture of this place , but i promise there is good news .
but beyond that , we recognized that bertie county , as a community , was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking .
it &apos;s a systems-level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom .
and during that time , they &apos;re doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding , coming back into the studio , doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work , and then moving into the shop and actually testing them , building them , prototyping them , figuring out if they are going to work and refining that .
because , when you zoom out that far , you lose the ability to view people as humans .
one : provide care to children who are currently being deprived of treatment .
thank you .
if you show him real world images , if you show others like him real world images , they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over-fragmented ; it &apos;s made up of a collage , a patchwork , of regions of different colors and luminances .
this simple idea has far reaching implications .
because , if that hypothesis were to be true , it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what &apos;s causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype .
they pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs , and so i won a full ride to georgetown and i &apos;ve been there for four years . love it .
in the spring of 1996 , with my goal of making the u.s. paralympic team that may coming up full speed , i joined the women &apos;s track team .
it was , like , this is my time for shine .
all this training -- i had transformed my life .
am : it &apos;s a company in san diego called flex-foot .
it &apos;s the only game in the world that i know of that allows you , the player , the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less .
and we have to connect both levels , so if you &apos;re up there , you &apos;re going to be reaching down and reaching up .
so you used creativity . that was great .
how many of you won just won thumb ?
now rather than just argue about this number , a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he &apos;ll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the westin , and then to mars ...
because what little hoodlum wouldn &apos;t want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket .
lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world , except if you &apos;re learning it .
yet , that &apos;s the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice .
i &apos;m not for one minute suggesting that , if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre -- they should do that .
this one kind of annoys me , i must say .
if you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it .
in the end , if we test everyone by hand in exams , it &apos;s kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters .
things were going pretty well .
as an architect , that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself .
i liked it sighted . it was fine .
they don &apos;t like it when you drive .
so , that was hard .
so , i wanted to follow that rule .
the first is , thou shalt not take the bible literally .
so , this idea of sacredness , whether or not there is a god .
the key is to pick and choose the right parts .
but in the quarter-century since then , we &apos;ve seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk .
this little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well .
this work is 15 years old .
so now we &apos;ve got the stuff color-sorted , angle maps onto color .
let &apos;s pull this apart : i &apos;ll go ahead and explode it .
we can &apos;t have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start .
so , whether it &apos;s logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction , financial services , pharmaceuticals , bioinformatics , those are the topics right now , but that &apos;s not a killer app .
it &apos;s since been deployed in mexico to track electoral fraud .
there are other candidates of course , but lolcats will do as a general case .
the white group there is the control group ; they change nothing .
this is good . i like lolcats as much as the next guy , maybe a little more even , but this is also a largely solved problem .
you fought by day , then it was sunset , so everyone went back home .
and so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .
but what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in indian entertainment .
now , this last minute before i go -- there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
now , the question i &apos;m going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in oxford .
indeed , this is kind of like the sesame street game of &quot; which thing doesn &apos;t belong ? &quot; and you &apos;re right to say it &apos;s the swimming pool that doesn &apos;t belong , because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that &apos;s actually very dangerous .
how much is this big mac worth ? is it worth 25 dollars ?
you also have a 20-dollar bill .
most people don &apos;t want the most expensive , they don &apos;t want the least expensive .
because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello ! -- doesn &apos;t know where it came from .
again , an easy decision , because we all know that now is better than later .
and i want you to see that two things are true .
that was remarkable .
dg : well , go to israel . you know , go to israel . and a mall blows up , and then everybody &apos;s unhappy about it , and an hour-and-a-half later -- at least when i was there , and i was 150 feet from the mall when it blew up -- i went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on .
and there &apos;s a good reason to be , because old stuff didn &apos;t eat you . right ?
adg : in persuading them .
since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn &apos;t seem to be an argument there .
it says , &quot; thoughts : this poem is impossible .
there were 10 artists invited to participate in it , and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and i didn &apos;t want to be embarrassed , so i worked very hard on this .
this reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full-blown disgust response , no longer just about whether or not we &apos;re about to be poisoned , but whenever there &apos;s a threat of physical contamination from some source . but the face remains strikingly similar .
jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor .
and what they &apos;ve demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that i showed you .
the previous speaker has , i think , really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me , and my sense of loss , and trying to find the answer to the big questions .
marcus : so i &apos;ve done my bit for queen and country , now i work for myself .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
onicha : yes , mama .
you know what you are ? a crocodile .
our government was corrupt .
but i &apos;m just saying to factor that in , factor that in with all this great advancement , all this pronouncement of great achievement .
or we can zoom out to the table of contents , and the video keeps playing .
dr. mullis was talking about his experiments , and i realized that i almost became a scientist .
when i can predict or plan it , i don &apos;t do it .
fg : i knew you &apos;d ask that question .
my preconception of bilbao was this wonderful building , you go inside and there &apos;d be extraordinary spaces .
and i think that &apos;s the issue , you know ; it &apos;s the &quot; then what &quot; that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren &apos;t hiring architects for that .
fg : no , no . wait a minute !
the good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff , particularly in regions of the world like here in europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner .
this is a photo i took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in mumbai , india .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic composite : many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics .
so i started to think of , how can i rethink the landscape ?
these images of bangladesh came out of a radio program i was listening to .
and again , when you start seeing that kind of embrace , and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very , very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint , it starts to become very sobering .
it &apos;s an incredibly massive operation , i think 15,000 workers , five cupolas , and the sixth one &apos;s coming in here .
it just gives you a sense of , again -- and that &apos;s where , really , the whole migration of jobs started going over to china and making the shoes . nike was one of the early ones .
here &apos;s another operation . it &apos;s all cottage industries , so it &apos;s not big places -- it &apos;s all in people &apos;s front porches , in their backyards , even in their homes they &apos;re burning boards , if there &apos;s a concern for somebody coming by -- because it is considered in china to be illegal , doing it , but they can &apos;t stop the product from coming in .
and so in this case , because it &apos;s about a lot of these images and what they represent , and the kinds of questions they bring up , that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say , &quot; well , what &apos;s worldchanging.com , with these images , have to do ? &quot;
i think all schools could use extra equipment , extra cash -- it &apos;s going to be an incentive for them to do that .
we make them again and again .
what we need is a population that &apos;s basically smart , can make lots of decisions , but doesn &apos;t have access to any of the systems we have , any of the things that might mess us up -- no human technology , human culture , maybe even not human language .
what you &apos;re looking at over here is actually the first unit that i know of of non-human currency .
and so we said , well , what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency , if they were really using it like money ?
they really cared about their monkey token dollar .
most people actually go with the play-it-safe option .
the idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red .
maybe we should see how they do with losses .
we wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from .
the hope is that you all will think about your limitations , not necessarily as unovercomable , but to recognize them , accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out .
that &apos;s one billion people in the world live in slums .
mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks .
think back to that three billion people that need a new home , and maybe this is a contributor to reducing .
or bicycles : for example , in amsterdam , more than 30 percent of the population uses bicycles , despite the fact that the netherlands has a higher income per capita than the united states .
we fought not just for space for buses , but we fought for space for people , and that was even more difficult .
in many developing country cities , more than 80 and 90 percent of the city which will exist in 2060 will be built over the next four or five decades .
but you see , when a city is only being created , it &apos;s very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure .
my task was , at least once a week , to visit mother lassiter who lived on east street , mother williamson who lived on bledsoe avenue , and mother lathers who lived on oberlin road .
and mom overheard us and said , &quot; well , you know what ? if you really understand the nature of this celebration , it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love .
i saw it when the dalai lama came to the riverside church while i was a pastor , and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world .
so when the white house was built in the early 19th century , it was an open house .
scientists have been studying in recent years the phenomenon that they often describe as flow , that the design of our systems , whether natural or social , channel the flow of whatever runs through them .
it &apos;s also about creating government .
british columbia , canada , is publishing a catalogue of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage with the state in the cocreation of governance .
they &apos;re not fun enough . they &apos;re not exciting enough to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity that awaits us . but i would argue that if we want to see the kinds of innovations , the hopeful and exciting innovations that we hear talked about here at ted , in clean energy , in clean education , in development , if we want to see those adopted and we want to see those scaled , we want to see them become the governance of tomorrow , then we must all participate , then we must get involved .
and that is that those museums are usually passive , they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience , as the receiver of information .
where would it go ?
that was the lounge .
there are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit .
and the bubble will inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of 2013 .
it was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system , and using religion to get what they want to get out of us , which is the oil , the diamond , the gold and the land .
one year later , live with an ak-47 by my side .
i was ready to eat .
so in my village now , kids there , they normally listen to bbc , or any radio , and they are waiting to know , the day emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school .
so in order to do that , i founded a charter called gua africa , where we put kids in school .
but i don &apos;t want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment . i certainly think that my client shouldn &apos;t have been executed , but what i would like to do today instead is talk about the death penalty in a way i &apos;ve never done before , in a way that is entirely noncontroversial .
it means that it &apos;s in the low 60 percent .
i think of these five chapters as points of intervention , places in their lives when our society could &apos;ve intervened in their lives and nudged them off of the path that they were on that created a consequence that we all -- death penalty supporters or death penalty opponents -- say was a bad result .
and he was talking first about his dad , who he hardly knew , who had died , and then about his mom , who he did know , who is still alive .
so i said , &quot; well , mom and dad , what about santa claus ?
and she said , &quot; listen . the cut-off date to start kindergarten was september 15 . &quot;
ok . so i sat them down and i got them glasses of water , and after niceties they said , &quot; do you believe that god loves you with all his heart ? &quot;
well , then they said , &quot; do you believe that god speaks to us through his righteous prophets ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t . &quot;
so , i couldn &apos;t let myself feel condescending towards these boys .
come on . in the western world , we have enough .
we all have one planet . we all have to share it .
that is longer than in the usa .
i think we want it to carry on .
keep building them .
and we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them -- something like the happy planet index .
then i started to think about the people in the himalayas whose cataracts would be helped , and i realized that i went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus to altruistic joy , to feeling good for the people that were being helped . i think that &apos;s a motivator .
and the strangler says very matter-of-factly , &quot; oh no . if i &apos;d felt the distress , i could not have done it .
immediately someone went to get orange juice , someone brought a hotdog , someone brought a subway cop .
the cognitive map in your mind may tell you , &quot; aris , go back to the main cathedral square , take a 90-degree turn , and walk down that other side street . &quot;
they were not geographically distorted .
so straightened lines , cleaned-up corners , and , of course , that very , very important geographic distortion that makes public transport maps possible .
how do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days ?
so i basically roughed out what html should look like : hypertext protocol , http ; the idea of urls , these names for things which started with http .
so yeah , it was difficult to explain , but there was a grassroots movement .
he had put it together , combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he &apos;d put it into this software , which i think his son developed , originally , and produces this wonderful presentation .
and , pretty soon chris bizer at the freie universitat in berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up , he noticed that wikipedia -- you know wikipedia , the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it .
tim berners-lee : can you say &quot; data &quot; ?
in fact , data is about our lives .
so , linked data -- it &apos;s huge .
anyway , for now , anyone involved in getting these results , thank you . i think this proved these goals are worth it .
and if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment , and that comment turned into a commitment , we could crowdsource a force of 300 million people around the world to help see these goals through .
it will get harder as we get towards zero , as the poor will be increasingly located in post-conflict , fragile states , or maybe in middle income states where they don &apos;t really care about the marginalized .
thank you , thank you .
and so , you know , so got one secondhand 747 from boeing and gave it a go .
i was actually also curious why -- i think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch . you called it mates .
rb : it &apos;s a tough job , isn &apos;t it ?
so this interior is philippe starcke designed ?
rb : no , he told me jump , but once his weight had gone , the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and i ...
ok , this isn &apos;t exactly hardball . ok .
did this really happen ?
it &apos;s actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century . &quot;
you started talking in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy .
it &apos;s important that if people do go to africa and do try to help , they don &apos;t just go in there and then leave after a few years .
and you actually did inspire me . i looked at you , i thought , well , he &apos;s made it . maybe there is a different way .
he just started asking , &quot; where did you buy the radio ? how much is it ? &quot;
because when i was capturing traces , you know , this thought comes to me always : is it , only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace , or is there other ways to capture it ? &quot;
and context , what is really context ?
but a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six , seven months , in the restroom , when i was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor .
while i was doing that work , my mom and my dad , they were looking at it and they said , &quot; why do you deal with negative subjects all the time ? &quot;
the skin of this is also representing this .
because when we see someone walks , we see the footprint .
so nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is , so i thought i would ask the person who &apos;s spearheading the effort to generate data on this , pascal lamy , the director of the world trade organization , what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of gdp , without the double- and triple-counting , and it &apos;s actually probably a bit under 20 percent , rather than the 30 percent-plus numbers that we &apos;re talking about .
because , in some sense , it &apos;s the ideal kind of technology to think about . theoretically , it makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door .
so , here you can see the change from use -- starting to use contemporary materials .
the marketing is , the bigger a brand , the more difficult it is to reposition it .
and there are parallels for marketing -- you can invest for a long time in a brand , but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers &apos; belief .
the message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed .
and today , the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music , dance , contemporary and world music -- in the u.k. , in france , in spain and in italy .
this baseball model is incredibly problematic .
it starts with an internal sense , an internal desire , or a need .
but what about pizza ?
i think our ancestors -- i think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago .
but the moment you fall in love , you become extremely sexually possessive of them .
and in fact , i think it &apos;s more powerful than the sex drive .
women are moving back into the job market .
because the female parts of the brain are better connected , they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think , put them into more complex patterns , see more options and outcomes .
they &apos;re now saying that in america , that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85 .
i think the happiness we find , we make .
i &apos;ve been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years .
these circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain .
you see , in the hubris of my youth , i thought i had her all figured out .
you treat the obesity .
what if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening , an underlying epidemic , the one we ought to be worried about ?
some think it &apos;s too many calories consumed .
you didn &apos;t need my judgment and my contempt .
and my first car was a 1975 electric-green mustang .
we &apos;re pushing fuel efficiency to new heights .
when america began moving west , we didn &apos;t add more wagon trains , we built railroads .
or being at a future ted conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time .
charlie ledbetter , yesterday , i thought , talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers , to bring people into the process of creating things .
they said , ok , it &apos;s not about systemic change .
so there &apos;s a whole series of just using your eyes , seeing things for the first time , seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities .
people consciously follow things even though , why , we don &apos;t know .
hammer it together . hammer it together with a shoe , if you &apos;re me , because they &apos;re impossible to assemble .
and , again , as designers , we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form .
we &apos;ve heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers .
and we did . the data was conclusive .
so , on august 15th , again , independence day , 2009 , empowered with the same process , we empowered 100,000 children to say , &quot; i can . &quot;
first they have cleaned the society , then it will be hyderabad , and soon india .
as an architect you design for the present , with an awareness of the past , for a future which is essentially unknown .
and this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet earth &apos;s sourcebook , and you had the hippie movement .
so basically , if you wanted to generalize , you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there , that the energy consumed reduces dramatically .
in 2001 , this building received an award .
and you can measure the performance , in terms of energy consumption , of that building against a typical library .
it &apos;s not that long ago , 17 years , and here we are now .
what are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site ?
so what happens when we take that and you expand that further into the chinese society ?
this is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps .
i really owe a short introduction of this man to you .
it &apos;s a little bit of a different story , this health aspect of light , than what i &apos;m telling you today .
it was just a much smaller city , and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous .
i just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works .
and we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments .
now , i was paid in dollars as a consultant , and i looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself : &quot; is there a line in my return , which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible ?
the research guidelines of u.s. national academy of sciences or research councils of the u.k .
and we do not ask this question .
kabir , rahim , all the great sufi saints , they were all poor people , and they had a great reason .
so this fellow is bringing a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler .
he has designed this plate with a handle .
my technology .
this stand on the front wheel , you will not find on any cycle .
and this is what he did , a sewing machine in uttar pradesh .
and maybe to put that in perspective : there &apos;s so much data on this , i &apos;ll be happy to give it to you in different forms .
nobody would want to give them up .
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars .
so , having seen this , and having worried about it for eight years , the first thing i do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys , call aarp , get an appointment right away .
it makes just enough electricity to , for instance , do this , which at night is enough electricity , in the rest of the world , as mr. holly -- dr. holly -- pointed out , can run computers and a light bulb .
in response to this terrifying violence , the mayor of apatzingán decided to call the citizens to a march for peace .
i urge you , but only a little bit , because i don &apos;t want to get you in trouble , to just ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want , wherever you want it , whenever you want it , anywhere in the u.s. , and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message , they guarantee delivery of the drug in 30 minutes or less .
they have designed new drug products and new drug processes .
but also it &apos;s part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future . and we have a long lead-time .
many technologies , at that point , displace another technology , and that &apos;s another important point .
they &apos;re being commodified , and that &apos;s what happens when things go to zero . it &apos;s a tough market out there .
it &apos;s not just for the geeks any more .
they &apos;re facing a force that they haven &apos;t faced before .
they use mobutu as metaphor .
and he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether , despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in india make under a dollar a day .
and though that company has just started , our assumption is that there too we &apos;ll see the impact on millions .
educational initiatives like dil and the citizen foundation that are building schools across the country .
our generation has seen both approaches tried , and often fail .
and because i wanted to impress you all with slides , since i saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs , i made a graph that moves , and i talk about the makeup of me .
they sent a search party , and i overheard people saying they wish i had killed myself , jumped off bible peak .
they said , &quot; separate your bank account -- spend your money ; spend his money . that &apos;s it . &quot;
so odin was documented every single day .
i showed a norman rockwell painting before , and this one i grew up with , looking at constantly .
and the last story i really want to tell is this story , because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what i &apos;m doing .
it was fished sustainably till all of time , except for our generation .
we don &apos;t know where the structure is .
and i &apos;m going to show you three clips , because i tagged 1,100 tunas .
living amongst our tunas -- our north american tunas -- are european tunas that go back to the med .
we also tag makos with our noaa colleagues , blue sharks .
we did this with the great turtle race -- tagged turtles , brought in four million hits .
and then literally just out of nowhere , the guy asks me , &quot; where were you september 12th ? &quot;
you &apos;re basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death .
with pictures , with travel tips .
so these are the stores that i shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know .
and then sometimes you don &apos;t get much information at all , you just get this empty bed .
so what do you do when everything is out there ?
central intelligence agency .
now , i mention squeak because sebastian &apos;s first guest happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen , and she promised that she would refrain from leaving a bad review on one condition : he got a cat .
because at its core , it &apos;s about empowerment .
yes , there &apos;s actually a four-stage , rigorous interview process that &apos;s designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy rabbits .
now , i know what you might be thinking .
this isn &apos;t some far-off frontier .
when you talk to super-users , whether that &apos;s superrabbits or super-people on stack overflow , or uberhosts , they all talk about how having a high reputation unlocks a sense of their own power .
but if we jump forward 400 years , the tone about sleep changes somewhat .
okay . so where have we got to ?
and what seems to be going on is that , in the brain , those neural connections that are important , those synaptic connections that are important , are linked and strengthened , while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important .
one of the things that the brain does is indulge in micro-sleeps , this involuntary falling asleep , and you have essentially no control over it .
ghrelin is released . it gets to the brain .
actually , reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed .
well that &apos;s wrong at so many different levels .
other work flowed from these studies .
what &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can compare societies , more and less equal societies , and see what inequality does .
and there , you see it in relation to the measure of inequality i &apos;ve just shown you , which i shall use over and over again in the data .
so here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality .
extraordinarily damaging , if you &apos;re talking about using the talents of the population .
it has lower taxes .
it also leads to status insecurity .
and indeed , people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes .
and how big a problem is this ?
he &apos;s wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee , and he &apos;s doing that same 10-meter walk test .
but here we have the version three , the remotion knee , but if you look in here , you can see the noise dampener . it &apos;s quieter .
i was born in the 1970s , and john travolta was big in those days : &quot; grease , &quot; &quot; saturday night fever , &quot; and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me to start dancing . my parents were very up for me going .
usually , dance has a stimulus or stimuli , and i thought i &apos;d take something simple , ted logo , we can all see it , it &apos;s quite easy to work with , and i &apos;m going to do something very simply , where you take one idea from a body , and it happens to be my body , and translate that into somebody else &apos;s body , so it &apos;s a direct transfer , transformation of energy .
okay . from there i &apos;m going to do a very different thing .
separate . face the front . separate . face the front .
if i already then said about that space that you &apos;re in , let &apos;s infuse it with the color red , what does that do to the body ? if i then said to you , what happens if that whole wall on the side of &quot; e &quot; collapses and you have to use your weight to put it back up , what would you be able to do with it ?
it was my first week in federal prison , and i was learning quickly that it wasn &apos;t what you see on tv .
whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse , sculpting people &apos;s hair with toenail clippers , or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs , prisoners learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start restaurants , barber shops , personal training businesses .
is that a good way to play ping-pong ?
now some people can -- circus workers , steel workers .
visceral is subconscious , you &apos;re unaware of it .
so jake cress is this furniture maker , and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture .
that seemed a little damning , and i tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure , or with the availability of electricity , and things like that .
they &apos;re called the hole-in-the-wall experiments .
people said , you know , you really ought to have this in indian languages .
this sequence is also nice . this is a small child , a six-year-old , telling his eldest sister what to do .
and if you tested him , he would answer every question correctly on that topic .
and learning is most likely a self-organizing system .
and you &apos;re like , &quot; oh , i didn &apos;t want to see that . &quot;
i believe in randomness , and one of the reasons i believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random .
i became a speechwriter for the british foreign secretary .
the foreign office was very generous .
and i started to fall .
those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration .
and it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ? what if ! , which some of you have probably heard of .
we are all intimately connected .
and my politics has changed fundamentally from when i was a diplomat to what i am today , and i think that outputs is what matters , not process , not technology , frankly , so much either .
how do these nielsen ratings reflect not just what you &apos;ve heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-10 nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ?
and on a factual basis , over 80 percent of the u.s. &apos; s most popular shows are exported around the world .
irreverence starts to rise .
archie bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago .
what do people want in their tv then ?
it &apos;s my first year as a new high school science teacher , and i &apos;m so eager .
but if you &apos;re a virus and you see this , you cross those little legs of yours and you think , &quot; we rock . &quot;
but if you &apos;ve graduated from high school , i can almost guarantee you &apos;ve seen this information before .
then it would be accurate , but it would be completely impossible to understand .
so we are so lucky that we have resources like the internet , where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up .
and when that happens , the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings .
others use dancing , spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence .
durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group , into a moral community .
he said , &quot; if the one tribe included a great number of courageous , sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other , this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other . &quot;
the free-riders have taken over .
in fact , often , as we &apos;ve seen happen in a lot of the arab spring revolts , often those divisions are along religious lines .
we unleashed earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort .
my office was on one half of the bedroom , and his bedroom was on the other half .
take this place for example .
you come into this major airport , and they simply have a b .
so , this is from &quot; 2nd sight , &quot; a book i did on intuition .
it now has no relevance to the book whatsoever , but it &apos;s a nice spread , i think , in there .
i was in the caribbean at christmas , and i &apos;m just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell -- not that they will sell -- that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin .
having done a lot of magazines , i &apos;m very curious how big magazines handle big stories , and i was very curious to see how time and newsweek would handle 9 / 11 .
this is -- i like found art ; hand lettering &apos;s coming back in a big way , and i thought this was a great example of both .
it was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the applied arts and science at cambridge university in 1829 .
we find life at the bottom of every long-term , long-distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up -- and there &apos;s bacteria in the pores of that rock .
most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non-technology , or even life .
all of them are still being produced . so you &apos;ve got corn shellers .
there was no difference whatsoever . and at the big bang , what it expanded was the potential for difference .
and if you play that well , you &apos;ll have other people involved , so even that game extends and continues even when you &apos;re gone .
and what changed ? technological innovation .
and in that situation , sifting through the wreckage of a suicide drone attack , it will be very difficult to say who sent that weapon .
and ideas achieving critical mass is what political activism in popular government is all about .
autocratic governments and criminal organizations undoubtedly will , but let &apos;s not join them .
then he lifts another arm and i lift an arm .
it was like , &quot; i don &apos;t know what that thing is , but he &apos;s no threat to me . &quot;
in fact , this whole area is like a yellowstone national park with all of the trimmings .
where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay .
look in your heart , actually .
and this is beijing international art camp where i worked before the government forcibly demolished it.i used this work to express my objection .
but it doesn &apos;t work , my eyes are still small .
the next pieces of work show how i made myself invisible in magazines of different languages , in different countries and at different times .
not only that -- we always have this vague notion that something &apos;s expected of us .
consequently , we have .
so we have this kind of dual nature .
that is , you ask any generic question about this -- how many trees of a given size , how many branches of a given size does a tree have , how many leaves , what is the energy flowing through each branch , what is the size of the canopy , what is its growth , what is its mortality ?
it &apos;s three-quarters , roughly , which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear .
and the bottom one is you lot -- super-creatives plotted in the same way .
you grow fast and then stop -- part of our resilience .
there they are . that &apos;s 23,000 companies .
and that night , all 90 kids -- dressed appropriately , doing their job , owning it .
we are a nine through 12 public school , but we do school quite differently .
and when we do another round of this in my class this year , they will do better this time , because learning has to include an amount of failure , because failure is instructional in the process .
regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago .
there are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what i would call healthy aging .
a mammalian fetus , if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy , will re-grow that limb .
the horse just has another nostril that &apos;s developed because of a riding accident .
at this time this was an n of 20 . now there &apos;s an n of about 100 .
the good news is that this is happening today .
and while i don &apos;t have any patents that i &apos;m aware of , you will be meeting a few of my inventions today .
there are so many celebrities running around here .
and of course , we know it &apos;s all because of the -- all the ...
at my school -- actually i was part of co-founding an organization , which is like a leadership thing , you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything .
and they &apos;ve inspired many characters as well .
and i said , &quot; yes , men can be difficult , but all women have to get used to that . &quot;
when i first moved to hollywood from silicon valley , i had some misgivings .
i then had a bit of a wake-up call when i was 14 .
these leading , innovative , nonprofit folks , who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems .
and our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change .
and so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest , and today is mandatory viewing in schools in england and scotland , and most of scandinavia .
and i like this one , &quot; snow has returned to kilimanjaro . &quot;
believe it or not , some of us do survive .
it &apos;s been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the u.k .
so what we going to do now ?
no ? yes ? doesn &apos;t matter , it worked .
there are too many of us outside and everybody , just to borrow a bit from hans -- hans rosling , he &apos;s my guy -- if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention , it &apos;s the problems . but what we really need are african solutions that are appropriate for africa -- looking at the culture , looking at the people , looking at how much money they &apos;ve got .
it doesn &apos;t have to be in the closet . &quot;
avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
and you &apos;ll see why 1984 won &apos;t be like &quot; 1984 . &quot;
but some of the files were left behind intact , and activists , some of them , found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges , their cellphone text message exchanges , even skype conversations .
the other part of the story are requirements that the chinese government places on all companies operating on the chinese internet , known as a system of self-discipline .
similarly , governments don &apos;t enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day .
this event meant a great deal to me personally .
and where were they heading ?
now italian police , when this trade started , had just two boats which could go at the same speed .
since the beginning of globalization , the global narcotics market has expanded enormously .
i expect some of you remember the iloveyou virus , one of the very great worldwide viruses that came .
journalist misha glenny spent several years in a courageous investigation of organized crime networks worldwide , which have grown to an estimated 15 % of the global economy . from the russian mafia , to giant drug cartels , his sources include not just intelligence and law enforcement officials but criminal insiders .
and they looked at the herbivores . and they weren &apos;t savanna herbivores .
it had been waiting there since 1960 when alister hardy , a marine biologist , said , &quot; i think what happened , perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time . &quot;
do you think that &apos;s significant ?
i ask people sometimes , and they say , &quot; i like the aquatic theory !
so we never hear the case put for it , except in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe .
i do not wish to invest the money in senegal due to unfavorable economic climate , and so close to my country .
audience : yes .
and i gotta say that , you know , it &apos;s really , really great to be here .
do you have a preference ? good choice .
i mean this is incredible . this is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this and submitted it . it &apos;s just gorgeous .
the second one -- unlike most animals , which is survival of the species -- this is preservation of self .
now , i &apos;m going to give you a four paragraph format to work with .
so , what your letter means : i &apos;ve got to tell you , we are all in a party , and political officials are the pinatas .
so it seems right .
so the memorial opened in 2011 , and the museum &apos;s going to open next year in 2014 .
voice 9 : we were actually in a meeting when someone barged in and said , &quot; oh my god , a plane has just crashed into the world trade center . &quot;
voice 3 : and i knew when i saw that , people who were there that day who immediately went to help people known and unknown to them was something that would pull us through .
and much of what i do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form .
and so the inflatable heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves .
i really just don &apos;t even know how to say hello .
that is the equivalent of what we face now .
so i &apos;m a social psychologist , and i study morality , and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds .
it used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in congress .
so for a lot of reasons , those decades after the second world war were an historically anomalous time .
no labels and common cause , i think , have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more responsive and our congress more effective .
but even if you blame nobody , it still is a national problem , and one side has been more concerned about it than the other .
and so , because the prison-industrial complex is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls , groups of fiscal conservatives and christian conservatives have come together to form a group called right on crime .
this little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living .
would it give this block of limestone new properties ?
but gradually , as the buildings are repaired , we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city .
&apos;hi , &apos; i said , and then i returned to the couch , where i sat in silence for several moments .
loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don &apos;t make sense , and if the words get jumbled up enough , it &apos;s called &quot; word salad . &quot;
i had two earlier in england .
eventually , i came to los angeles to teach at the university of southern california law school .
even with all that — excellent treatment , wonderful family and friends , supportive work environment — i did not make my illness public until relatively late in life , and that &apos;s because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that i didn &apos;t feel safe with people knowing .
we built the hardware and the software .
sebastian thrun : google &apos;s driverless car
the problem is that all over the west now it looks like this .
in some states , senior water rights holders can leave their water in-stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right .
four years ago today , exactly , actually , i started a fashion blog called style rookie .
so i said on my blog that i wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing , their photography , whatever , to be a member of our staff .
he &apos;s by far the happiest man ever measured by science .
in google , expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern .
what does that mean ?
in our experience , there are three ingredients .
the second step is developing self-knowledge and self-mastery .
and what i recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .
or in zimbabwe , where i remember innocent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; i &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; i have heard it said &quot; -- because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling -- &quot; i have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot;
and people often say to me , &quot; you know , this is great , but it &apos;s wildly idealistic .
and i basically live my life in sort of a trance , and i look around and everything i see is just the beginning of a long story .
but design -- oh , my god .
and then , for instance , this other exhibition that was entitled workspheres in 2001 , where i asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time .
but what is interesting is that we don &apos;t need to talk about design and art anymore ; design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point .
even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint , all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by ana mir in barcelona .
paola antonelli : treat design as art
you know , someone would come in with a list of the people who haven &apos;t paid school fees , and when they started getting pretty strict , you had to leave , until your school fees could be paid .
and so i went on to google , cryptococcal meningitis , you know .
and i was just moved .
the cheetah generation .
you know , i believe that accountability stems from demand .
he &apos;s an undergrad professor , mitchell seligson .
you know , lebanon as a country has been once destroyed by a long and bloody civil war .
in october 2003 , over 6,000 runners from 49 different nationalities came to the start line , all determined , and when the gunfire went off , this time it was a signal to run in harmony for a change .
the culture of giving and doing good has become contagious .
he &apos;s a doctor there .
now let me take you back to parol .
in fact , there are three lights in there , three wavelengths of light .
no cities like you see today in doha or dubai or abu dhabi or kuwait or riyadh .
this is history being made in this region .
so we also face risks .
good afternoon . i am proud to be here at tedxkrakow .
it was looking like the frozen region , literally a refrigerator , and there are only two types of meals there : steak , which stands for a mubarak , ben ali-type of military police dictatorship , or a potato , which stands for tehran types of theocracies .
same with planning . somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution ?
you have enthusiasm higher , you see fear starting to melt .
but here is also the bad news .
and she said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
she said , &quot; you &apos;re like the worst vulnerability role model ever . &quot;
adaptability to change is all about vulnerability .
and we &apos;re going to walk in .
there &apos;s a great quote that saved me this past year by theodore roosevelt .
shame is highly , highly correlated with addiction , depression , violence , aggression , bullying , suicide , eating disorders .
and i said , &quot; why ? &quot;
shame is an unspoken epidemic , the secret behind many forms of broken behavior . brené brown , whose earlier talk on vulnerability became a viral hit , explores what can happen when people confront their shame head-on . her own humor , humanity and vulnerability shine through every word .
we have a split wing .
a simple , well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions , and something even simpler , a pair of glasses , can make millions more see .
larry brilliant : he kept talking about mcdonalds and hamburgers , and none of it made any sense to us .
so i think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it , and in this process of using technology , make sure that most don &apos;t need to come to the base hospital .
i think in absolute terms , last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars , spent about 13 million , with over a 40 percent ebita .
you take dentistry , hearing aid , maternity and so on .
let me show you the weight-shifting mobile .
how do we calm it down ?
it showed that an arts practice can remake one &apos;s identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar .
california is basically the equivalent of europe , in this .
it is not the case that slums undermine prosperity , not the working slums ; they help create prosperity .
furthermore , people in the informal economy , the gray economy -- as time goes by , crime is happening around them . and they can join the criminal world , or they can join the legitimate world .
that &apos;s more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way .
coal is what is causing the climate problems .
here &apos;s another american design that came out of los alamos , and is now commercial .
because everybody is downstream , downwind of whatever is done .
they &apos;re looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff .
but climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution , but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our gdp .
and i &apos;m not just showing it to pick on motorola -- that &apos;s just a bonus .
the twin message is as comforting as it is mad .
it &apos;s not even mining .
we need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around .
dh : one more ?
god , i hate that . put your hands out like this , please .
bf : i &apos;m going to run up behind him .
dh : do you have a small farm animal ?
weird , no one dances . we &apos;re two guys doing this .
oh wait , it &apos;s on your side , barry .
raspyni brothers : juggle and jest
it &apos;s a decimal machine . everything &apos;s done in decimal .
you also need a printer , obviously , and everyone needs a printer .
now , of course , babbage &apos;s machine was entirely mechanical .
of course , he never built it , because he was always fiddling with new plans , but when it did get built , of course , in the 1940s , everything changed .
north pole . i &apos;ve done this picture last summer .
according to the u.n. , we speak about 250 million refugees in 2050 .
and i will forever feel a need to make reparations to iraq .
i &apos;m very proud to show you the teaser .
on the five of june , the environment day , everybody can download the movie on internet .
and so 15 years , actually , and about four billion dollars later , the genome was sequenced and published .
she goes home .
and at the time -- this was a few years ago -- it cost $ 100,000 .
not to worry though , that was quickly rescued by the ipod , facebook and , indeed , angry birds .
they all hated each other .
so it enables you to very rapidly aspirate , or suck out , rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole .
now , after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high , he would tell us that our question was completely stupid .
and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced .
finally , there &apos;s the force of gravity , which interacts with matter via its mass and spin .
whenever particles interact , nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions .
so there &apos;s an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges , which is not very symmetric , could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism .
it &apos;s a very beautiful object , and as with any unification , we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern .
one does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won &apos;t end up being true about nature .
i mean , is there a scale to it , at the smallest scale , or ... ?
you hear it going from one side of the valley to the other , from one group of nests to the next .
chimpanzees don &apos;t have a spoken language . we &apos;ve talked about that .
ways of reclaiming overused farmland , so that within two years they can again be productive .
the indigenous people around the world , before they made a major decision , used to sit around and ask themselves , &quot; how does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead ? &quot;
and these young people , when i talk to them , basically they were either depressed or apathetic , or bitter and angry . and they said more or less the same thing , &quot; we feel this way because we feel you &apos;ve compromised our future and there &apos;s nothing we can do about it . &quot;
once again , they &apos;re useful members of society .
all of these technologies we can use .
jane goodall : how humans and animals can live together
it simply means that they believe it &apos;s important to do it .
we married those ideas , and we created this meyerhoff scholars program .
and he said , in contrast , his jewish mother would say , &quot; izzy , did you ask a good question today ? &quot;
they had food they had packed out .
and most important , giving them a chance to build that community with faculty pulling them into the work and our assessing what works and what does not work .
all of my beverages are packaged in plastic , even at the health food market .
and so my research group at the media lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way , without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior .
pattie maes + pranav mistry : meet the sixthsense interaction
pr : i would like to say that i have learned so much from aicha , starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security , because it was november 2002 , and , frankly , we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members .
what if it was from a source like this ?
the smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers .
replace the top .
but by thinking differently , and shipping these , people can stay put .
there &apos;s a poem written by a very famous english poet at the end of the 19th century .
now that suits the powerful up to a moment .
and watch that beginning to happen .
and we will see increasingly that even we in the west will reach out , have to reach out , beyond the cozy circle of the atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world .
we are now interdependent .
ashdown &apos;s third law is that in the modern age , where everything is connected to everything , the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others .
but if you ask the average american what the optimal formula of longevity is , they probably couldn &apos;t tell you .
it reminds me of my college days .
and research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
this is a place where the oldest living female population is found .
if you were lucky enough to be born in okinawa , you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life .
so , we turned to the data again .
he &apos;s a multimillionaire , yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars to build a privacy fence , he said , &quot; for that kind of money i &apos;ll do it myself . &quot;
that &apos;s physical activity .
exercise programs usually start in january ; they &apos;re usually done by october .
smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities .
so hannah &apos;s approach , on the other hand , is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that free us from pre-designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves .
but no , this guy isn &apos;t slowing down .
but the technology exists now that can help us improve that .
they can have a precise idea of where they are , and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are .
if i look at your license plate number , i don &apos;t really know who you are .
and he wanted to go .
x prize founder peter diamandis talks about how he helped stephen hawking fulfill his dream of going to space -- by flying together into the upper atmosphere and experiencing weightlessness at zero g .
run the movie , please .
his death hit me pretty hard .
and i faced a whole new set of challenges .
and i stood there . and i reread my essay .
so the first step : get to the children , get to the mothers , and then follow up with family planning .
that was their perception .
and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic .
and then aids education in all schools , starting from university .
and let the next olympics save some lives .
and we believe if you want to help the poor , those who are living in poverty , access to credit must be a human right .
this robot can &apos;t be creepy or uncanny .
okay . awesome .
but what we do know is that it isn &apos;t 10 years or 10 billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away .
passion lives here . isn &apos;t it always true ?
the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the olympic stadium .
feminism has never been sexy , but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting , and i have seldom suffered from lack of men .
if families prosper , the village prospers , and eventually so does the whole country .
not better , but to make it good .
half the food produced in the usa is currently thrown away .
in fact -- i love the fact , i just have to mention this : rome in fact used to import oysters from london , at one stage . i think that &apos;s extraordinary .
and then 10 years later everything changed .
and again , food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision .
and i want us to ask now , what would ambrogio lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today ?
just like in language and other domains , we know that it &apos;s hard for people to parse very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure .
one study by coricelli and nagel gives a really sharp , interesting answer .
they play lots of trials with different amounts each time .
remember that we scanned both brains at the same time , so we can ask about time-synced activity in similar or different areas simultaneously , just like if you wanted to study a conversation and you were scanning two people talking to each other and you &apos;d expect common activity in language regions when they &apos;re actually kind of listening and communicating .
so this is an amazing memory test from nagoya , japan , primate research institute , where they &apos;ve done a lot of this research .
the mismatcher wants to mismatch .
thank you .
and so we have a choice , it seems to me .
and perhaps above all , to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking , so that because people have this charter , whatever their beliefs or lack of them , they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech , disdainful remarks from their religious leaders , their political leaders , from the captains of industry .
i decided to go with the latter .
eventually , i realized that i had really no content that i could count on , so i decided to move towards packaging .
they keep on motoring towards the campo de &apos; fiori , which they soon reach . ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace , which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon , and then is completely removed and doesn &apos;t appear again until six or seven the following morning .
you see that i &apos;m beginning to really lose control here and also hope .
and he finally gets enough strength together to climb up the ladder onto the roof , and all the pigeons , a la red balloon , are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city .
and then we can swoop inside and around ; and because we &apos;re flying , we don &apos;t really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time , so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page .
so these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft . , 12 ft. long proteins .
so you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one .
during his time at the american museum of natural history , andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions , like here in the gobi desert .
we now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world -- things like deep sequencing , which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species , but to look at entire metagenomes , the communities of teeming microorganisms in , on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species .
beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers -- people like that young girl from beloit , wisconsin .
but we &apos;re still nowhere near a typical place in the universe .
its structure contains , with ever-increasing precision , the structure of everything . this place , and not other places in the universe , is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality . and so , far from being insignificant , the fact that the laws of physics allow this , or even mandate that this can happen , is one of the most important things about the physical world .
and the limiting factor , there and here , is not resources , because they &apos;re plentiful , but knowledge , which is scarce .
they &apos;re not central to the human effort to face this problem , or problems in general .
so he was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win-win solution help his country .
so that if we want to create environments with good rules , we can &apos;t just tear down .
in that city there is a taiwanese firm that made the iphone that many of you have , and they made it with labor from chinese who moved there to shenzhen .
people can come live under the new charter , but no one is forced to live under it .
they also totally get the idea that in some instances they can make more credible promises to long-term investors -- the kind of investors who will come build the port , build the roads , in a new city -- they can make more credible promises if they do it along with a partner nation .
but , you could set us to work thinking about questions like , suppose it isn &apos;t just canada that does the deal with raul castro .
and that is , i understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists .
we &apos;re measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day , particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums .
this is actually just a microorganism .
the real concern that security departments have is designer viruses .
also , there &apos;s numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane .
15 seconds studio .
and you do it automatically and non-consciously .
and moderate on present-hedonism .
that &apos;s just one source .
we &apos;re finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know .
and those are titan and enceladus . titan is saturn &apos;s largest moon , and , until cassini had arrived there , was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system .
and what you see is bright and dark regions , and that &apos;s about as far as it got for us .
you are looking at a shoreline .
it &apos;s about the size of lake ontario .
now , there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar , and capturing the sight of our little , blue-ocean planet in the skies of other worlds .
you are joined by dozens of your israeli brothers and sisters .
yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories .
but i have seen first hand that if we do , they will multiply .
in the last year alone , thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information , and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable .
so what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment .
it &apos;s as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location , and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern .
so it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene , at least , of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them .
all i did was codify it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s simplest idea .
we say what we do , we say how we &apos;re different or how we &apos;re better and we expect some sort of a behavior , a purchase , a vote , something like that .
why would you buy an mp3 player from a computer company ?
i always say that , you know , if you hire people just because they can do a job , they &apos;ll work for your money , but if you hire people who believe what you believe , they &apos;ll work for you with blood and sweat and tears .
and further proof that langley was motivated by the wrong thing : the day the wright brothers took flight , he quit .
people don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe .
how do you do that ?
simon sinek : how great leaders inspire action
the real issue is that child is living with 12 other people in a two-bedroom apartment .
how is it that if for decades we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients , and especially low-income patients , healthy , that we didn &apos;t use it ?
and our volunteers can then work with them to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs in their communities .
unencumbered by clinical responsibilities , unwilling to take no for an answer from those bureaucracies that tend to crush patients , and with an unparalleled ability for information retrieval honed through years of using google .
now none of these solutions -- the prescription pad , the electronic medical record , the waiting room , the army of college students -- are perfect .
at verdun , in 1916 , over a 300-day period , 700,000 people were killed , so about 2,000 a day .
they conducted a credit card fraud that netted them over 10 billion dollars .
what should we do ?
this one , the comfort , operates throughout the caribbean and the coast of south america conducting patient treatments .
why do we want to get in these nets ?
my thesis for you is that by combining international , interagency , private-public , strategic communication , together , in this 21st century , we can create the sum of all security .
